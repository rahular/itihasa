<h3>Ayodhya Kanda: Chapter 6</h3><p id='1'>गते पुरोहिते रामः स्नातो नियतमानसः। सह पत्न्या विशालाक्ष्या नारायणमुपागमत्॥<br />When the priest had gone away, Rāma, having bathed and with a collected mind, began to adore Nārāyaṇa, in company with his wife having expansive eyes.</p>
<p id='2'>प्रगृह्य शिरसा पात्री हविषो विधिवत् ततः। महते दैवतायाज्यं जुहाव ज्वलितानले॥<br />Then raising the vessel of clarified butter to his head (by way of paying reverence), he in accordance with the ordinance began to offer oblations to the flaming fire on behalf of that mighty deity.</p>
<p id='3'>शेषं च हविषस्तस्य प्राश्याशास्यात्मनः प्रियम्। ध्यायनारायणं देवं स्वास्तीर्णे कुशसंस्तरे॥ वाग्यतः सह वैदेह्या भूत्वा नियतमानसः। श्रीमत्यायतने विष्णोः शिश्ये नरवरात्मजः॥<br />Then, having partaken of the remaining quantity of the clarified butter, Rāma prayed for his own welfare, and meditated on the god Nārāyaṇa.

<p id='10'>सिताभ्रशिखराभेषु देवतायतनेषु च। चतुष्पथेषु रथ्यासु चैत्येष्वट्टलकेषु च॥ नानापण्यसमृद्धेषु वणिजामापणेषु च। कुटुम्बिनां समृद्धेषु श्रीमत्सु भवनेषु च॥ सभासु चैव सर्वासु वृक्षेष्वालक्षितेषु च। ध्वजाः समुच्छ्रिताः साधु पताकाश्चाभवंस्तथा॥<br />Standards with pennons were beautifully reared up in the abodes of the gods resembling a peak, enveloped with white clouds, and at the crossing, and on high ways; and over the Caitya tree; and edifices; and over the ware-houses of merchants abounding in goods and the goodly and prosperous mansions of householders, and over all the council-houses and conspicuous trees.</p>

<p id='12'>रामाभिषेकयुक्ताश्च कथाश्चक्रुर्मिथो जनाः। रामाभिषेके सम्प्राप्ते चत्वरेषु गृहेषु च॥ बाला अपि क्रीडमाना गृहद्वारेषु सङ्घशः। रामाभिषवसंयुक्ताश्चक्रुरेव कथा मिथः॥<br />The people began to talk with each other anent the installation of Rāma, and the time for his installation having arrived, on terraces and houses, and doorways boys playing in bodies, conversed with each other concerning the installation of Rāma.</p>

<p id='14'>प्रकाशीकरणार्थ च निशागमनशङ्कया। दीपवृक्षांस्तथा चक्रुरनुरथ्यासु सर्वशः॥<br />And fearing lest Rāma should come out over night (to behold the beautified capital), the inhabitants of the city, by way of ornamentation as with the view of beholding Rāma himself, had by the road side reared up lamp-stands in the form of (branched) trees.</p>
<p id='15'>अलंकारं पुरस्यैवं कृत्वा तत् पुरवासिनः। आकाङ्क्षमाणा रामस्य यौवराज्याभिषेचनम्॥ समेत्य सङ्घशः सर्वे चत्वरेषु सभासु च। कथयन्तो मिथस्तत्र प्रशशंसुर्जनाधिपम्॥ अहो महात्मा राजायमिक्ष्वाकुकुलनन्दनः। ज्ञात्वा वृद्धं स्वमात्मानं रामं राज्येऽभिषेक्ष्यति ॥<br />Eagerly expecting the investiture of Rāma as the heir-apparent, all having thus ornamented the city and assembling them selves on terraces and in council-halls, talking with each other, extolled the lord of men, saying, “Ah high-souled is this king, the perpetuator of the Iksvāku race, for, knowing himself as old, he will install Rāma in the kingdom.</p>
