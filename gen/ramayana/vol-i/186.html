<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>निर्मर्यादस्तु पुरुषः पापाचारसमन्वितः। मानं न लभते सत्सु भिन्नचारित्रदर्शनः॥<br />The person that with his sinful acts sticking to him, walk astray, as well as he that hold up (to others) different patterns of character (from those recommended by scripture), does not win honour with the good.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>कुलीनमकुलीनं वा वीरं पुरुषमानिनम्। चारित्रमेव व्याख्याति शुचिं वा यदि वाशुचिम्॥<br />One's character (fashioned according to scripture) shows whether one is high-born or base, heroic or vainly priding himself on his manliness, pure or impure.</p>

<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>अधर्मं धर्मवेषेण यद्यहं लोकसंकरम्। अभिपत्स्ये शुभं हित्वा क्रियां विधिविवर्जिताम्॥ कश्चेतयानः पुरुषः कार्याकार्यविचक्षणः। बहु मन्येत मां लोके दुर्वृत्तं लोकदूषणम्।७।।<br />If I adopt this unrighteous course, calculated to produce confusion of castes, and do acts not recognized by scripture, I shall, renouncing good, have to reap only evil. Then what man possessed of consciousness and capable of discriminating between right and wrong, shall honour me, given to wicked ways and deserving of universal reprehension?</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>कस्य यास्याम्यहं वृत्तं केन वा स्वर्गमाप्नुयाम्। अनया वर्तमानोऽहं वृत्त्या हीनप्रतिज्ञया॥<br />Whose is this course (that you asked me to follow)? And by what way shall I attain heaven, by following the present course, which would make me give up my vow?</p>

<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>सत्यमेवेश्वरो लोके सत्ये धर्मः सदाश्रितः। सत्यमूलानि सर्वाणि सत्यानास्ति परं पदम्॥<br />In this world, truth is the Lord; in truth is established righteousness. Everything has truth for its basis. No condition is superior to truth.</p>

And it is for this that I reverence the same.</p>
