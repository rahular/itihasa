<h3>Ayodhya Kanda: Chapter 72</h3><p id='1'>अपश्यंस्तु ततस्तत्र पितरं पितुरालये। जगाम भरतो द्रष्टुं मातरं मातुरालये॥<br />Not having seen his father in his father's quarters, Bharata went to his mother's apartment for seeing her. *The text is evidently corrupt. From the sequel it appears that Bharata has not seen the king at that time. That commentator, however, passes over the point in silence, which is to be accounted for by the slovenliness of the way of though characterising the Sanskrit commentators in general. An English commentator would have considered the matter as of very great importance, but his Hindu brother takes it quietly, and passes on with indifference.</p>
<p id='2'>अनुप्राप्तं तु तं दृष्ट्वा कैकेयी प्रोषितं सुतम्। उत्पपात तदा हृष्टा त्यक्त्वा सौवर्णमासनम्॥<br />On seeing her son before her after his sojourn from home, Kaikeyi delighted, rose up from her golden seat.</p>
<p id='3'>स प्रविश्यैव धर्मात्मा स्वगृहं श्रीविवर्जितम्। भरतः प्रेक्ष्य जग्राह जनन्याश्चरणौ शुभौ॥<br />On entering his own quarter which he found deprived of grace, the virtuous Bharata took hold of his mother's auspicious feet.</p>
<p id='4'>तं मूर्ध्नि समुपाघ्राय परिष्वज्य यशस्विनम्। अङ्के भरतमारोप्य प्रष्टुं समुपक्रमे॥<br />Then smelling the crown of his head and embracing him and taking that illustrious one on her lap, Kaikeyi addressed him, saying.</p>
<p id='5'>अद्य ते कतिचिद् रात्र्यश्च्युतस्यार्यकवेश्मनः। अपि नाध्वश्रमः शीघ्रं रथेनापततस्तव॥<br />How many days hence did you leave the residence of the revered one? Have you felt any fatigue on the way incident to the car proceeding swiftly?</p>
<p id='6'>आर्यकस्ते सुकुशली युधाजिन्मातुलस्तव। प्रवासाच्च सुखं पुत्र सर्वं मे वक्तुमर्हसि ॥<br />And is the revered one will, and your maternal uncle, Yuddhajit? And, my son, have you passed your time pleasantly during your sojourn? It behoves you to tell me all this.</p>
<p id='7'>एवं पृष्ठस्तु कैकेय्या प्रियं पार्थिवनन्दनः। आचष्ट भरतः सर्व मात्र राजीवलोचनः।७।।<br />Thus asked that son of the king, Bharata, furnished with eyes resembling lotuses, told his mother that all was well.</p>
<p id='8'>अद्य मे सप्तमी रात्रिश्च्युतस्याकवेश्मनः। अम्बायाः कुशली तातो युधाजिन्मातुलश्च मे॥<br />Seven nights hence I took leave of that revered one's residence. My mother's sire is well, as also my maternal uncle, Yuddhajit.</p>
<p id='9'>यन्मे धनं च रत्नं च ददौ राजा परंतपः। परिश्रान्तं पथ्यभवत् ततोऽहं पूर्वमागतः॥ राजवाक्यहरैर्दूतैस्त्वर्यमाणोऽहमागतः। यदहं प्रष्टुमिच्छामि तदम्बा वक्तुमर्हति ॥<br />My vehicles had got tired in consequence of bearing the wealth and jewels which that subduer of foes, the king, had bestowed on me. And it is for this reason that I have come in advance of them. Urged by the royal emissaries, I have come here so swiftly. But it behoves my mother to tell me what I wish to ask.</p>
<p id='10'>शून्योऽयं शयनीयस्ते पर्यङ्को हेमभूषितः। न चायमिक्ष्वाकुजनः प्रहृष्टः प्रतिभाति मे॥<br />This sleeping bedstead of yours adorned with gold is empty. I do not see the race of Ikşvāku in their usual good spirits.</p>
<p id='11'>राजा भवति भूयिष्ठमिहाम्बाया निवेशने। तमहं नाद्य पश्यामि द्रष्टुमिच्छनिहागतः॥<br />The king generally remains in this apartment of my mother. But coming here with the desire of seeing him, I do not today find him at this place.</p>
<p id='12'>पितुर्ग्रहीष्ये पादौ च तं ममाख्याहि पृच्छतः। आहोस्विदम्बाज्येष्ठायाः कौसल्याया निवेशने॥<br />I would take the feet of my father. Do you tell me who ask you. Is he in the apartment of my eldest mother, Kausalya?</p>
<p id='13'>तं प्रत्युवाच कैकेयी प्रियवद् घोरमप्रियम्। अजानन्तं प्रजानन्ती राज्यलोभेन मोहिता॥<br />Blinded by the lust of dominion, and looking upon that as desirable (to Bharata) which was exceedingly disagreeable (to him), Kaikeyi replied to him, who did not know what had transpired.</p>
<p id='14'>या गतिः सर्वभूतानां तां गतिं ते पिता गतः। राजा महात्मा तेजस्वी यायजूकः सतां गतिः॥<br />That high-souled and energetic one ever engaged in sacrifice, the refuge of the good, your father, the king, has come by the state which pertains to all creatures.</p>
<p id='15'>तच्छ्रुत्वा भरतो वाक्यं धर्माभिजनवाञ्छुचिः। पपात सहसा भूमौ पितृशोकबलार्दितः॥ हा हतोऽस्मीति कृपणां दीनां वाचमुदीरयन्। निपपात महाबाहुर्बाहू विक्षिप्य वीर्यवान्॥<br />Hearing these words, Bharata of pure ways sprung from a righteous race, smite with the vehemence of sorrow on account of his father, suddenly fell down to the earth. And exclaiming in the anguish of spirit and in the excess of grief, the words, "Ah me! I am undone!" that mightyarmed one endowed with prowess, fell down, tossing about his arms.</p>
<p id='16'>ततः शोकेन संवीतः पितुर्मरणदुःखितः। विललाप महातेजा भ्रान्ताकुलितचेतनः॥<br />Then, overwhelmed with and distressed at the death of his father, that highly sorrow energetic one, with his senses distracted, indulged in lamentations.</p>
<p id='17'>एतत् सुरुचिरं भाति पितुर्मे शयनं पुरा। शशिनेवामलं रात्रौ गगनं तोयदात्यये॥ तदिदं न विभात्यद्य विहीनं तेन धीमता। व्योमेव शशिना हीनमप्शुष्क इव सागरः॥<br />This bed of my father used to look like the speckless welkin at night crowned with the moon, after the clouds have gone off. But to-day, deprived of that intellignet one, it ceases to shine, like the firmament without the moon or the sea devoid of its waters.</p>
<p id='18'>बाष्पमुत्सृज्य कण्ठेन स्वात्मना परिपीडितः। प्रच्छाद्य वदनं श्रीमद् वस्त्रेण जयतां वरः॥<br />Exclaiming with tears trickling down, that foremost of victorious ones, extremely afflicted at heart, wept, muffling his graceful countenance.</p>
<p id='19'>तमार्तं देवसंकाशं समीक्ष्य पतितं भुवि। निकृत्तमिव सालस्य स्कन्धं परशुना वने॥ माता मातङ्गसंकाशं चन्दार्कसदृशं सुतम्। उत्थापयित्वा शोकार्तं वचनं चेदमब्रवीत्॥<br />Seeing that one resembling a celestial fallen to the earth, stricken with sorrow, like to a bough of the Sāla that had been severed in the wood by an axe, his mother raising up he distressed son like a mad elephant or the sun or the moon, addressed him.</p>

<p id='24'>तदिदं ह्यन्यथाभूतं व्यवदीर्णं मनो मम। पितरं यो न पश्यामि नित्यं प्रियहिते रतम्॥<br />But it has fallen out otherwise. That I do not behold my father ever engaged in the dear welfare (of his subjects) cleaves my heart mother.</p>
