<p id='2'>तस्या हुंकारतो जाताः काम्बोजा रविसंनिभाः। ऊधसश्चाथ सम्भूता बर्बराः शस्त्रपाणयः॥ योनिदेशाच्च यवनाः शकृद्देशाच्छकाः स्मृताः। रोमकूपेषु म्लेच्छाश्च हारीताः सकिरातकाः॥<br />And from her roar, there came into being Kamvojas, resembling the Sun. And from her udders sprang Barbaras, arms in hand; and from her mysterious parts, Yavanas; from her anus, Sakas; and from the pores of her skin, those barbarians, Hārītas and Kirātas.</p>
<p id='3'>तैस्तन्निषूदितं सर्वं विश्वामित्रस्य तत्क्षणात्। सपदातिगजं साश्वं सरथं रघुनन्दन॥<br />And, (descendant of Raghu, Viśvāmitra's entire host consisting of foot, and elephant, and horse, and car, was exterminated by them.</p>
<p id='4'>दृष्ट्वा निषूदितं सैन्यं वसिष्ठेन महात्मना। विश्वामित्रसुतानां तु शतं नानाविधायुधम्॥ अभ्यधावत् सुसंक्रुद्धं वसिष्ठं जगतां वरम्। हुंकारेणैव तान् सर्वान् निर्ददाह महानृषिः॥<br />Seeing the army annihilated by the highsouled Vasiştha, the hundred sons of Viśvāmitra, equipped with various weapons, rushed in high ire against that best of mantra-reciting ones. Thereupon, uttering a roar, that mighty ascetic consumed them quite.</p>
<p id='5'>ते साश्वरथपादाता वसिष्ठेन महात्मना। भस्मीकृता मुहूर्तेन विश्वामित्रसुतास्तथा॥<br />In a moment, Viśvāmitra's sons together with horse and car and foot were reduced to ashes by the high-souled Vasistha.</p>
<p id='6'>दृष्ट्वा विनाशितान् सर्वान् बलं च सुमहायशाः। सव्रीडं चिन्तयाविष्टो विश्वामित्रोऽभवत् तदा॥<br />And witnessing them all destroyed, together with the army, the illustrious Viśvāmitra, covered with shame, became plunged in thought.</p>
<p id='7'>समुद्र इव निर्वेगो भग्नद्रष्ट्र इवोरगः। उपरक्त इवादित्यः सद्यो निप्रभतां गतः॥<br />And like to a tideless ocean or a fangless snake, he instantly became shorn of his effulgence, like to the sun overwhelmed by Rahu.* *A Daitya with the tail of a dragon, whose head was served from his body by Vişnu; but being immortal, the head and tail retained their separate existence, and being transferred to the stellar sphere, became the author of eclipses.</p>
<p id='8'>हतपुत्रबलो दीनो लूनपक्ष इव द्विजः। हतसर्वबलोत्साहो निर्वेदं समपद्यत॥<br />And deprived of his forces and sons, he appeared like a bird bereft of its wings; and losing his entire army and with it the high spirits that it had inspired him with, his heart died within him.</p>
<p id='9'>स पुत्रमेकं राज्याय पालयेति नियुज्य च। पृथिवीं क्षत्रधर्मेण वनमेवाभ्यपद्यत॥<br />Then entrusting one of his (remaining) sons with the sovereignty, with, 'Do you rule the earth agree ably to the duties of the Kșatriya,' he went into the forest.</p>
<p id='10'>स गत्वा हिमवत्पार्वे किंनरोरगसेवितम्। महादेवप्रसादार्थं तपस्तेपे महातपाः।.१२ ।।<br />And repairing to the side of the Himavat inhabited by Kinnaras and Serpents that one of mighty asceticism began to perform austerities with the view of propitiating Mahādeva.</p>

<p id='12'>किमर्थं तप्यसे राजन् ब्रूहि यत् ते विवक्षितम्। वरदोऽस्मि वरो यस्ते काङ्क्षितः सोऽभिधीयताम्।।१४।<br />What for, O king, art you performing penance?. Do you unfold what you have to say. I am for conferring a boon: do you express what boon you would obtain.</p>
<p id='13'>एवमुक्तस्तु देवेन विश्वामित्रो महातपाः। प्रणिपत्य महादेवं विश्वामित्रोऽब्रवीदिदम्॥<br />Thus addressed by that god, that performer of mighty austerities, Viśvāmitra, bowing down to him, addressed him, saying.</p>

<p id='15'>यानि देवेषु चास्त्राणि दानवेषु महर्षिषु । गन्धर्वयक्षरक्ष:सु प्रतिभान्तु ममानघ ॥<br />O sinless one, may all those weapons that are with the celestials and the Dānavas and the Maharșis and the Gandharvas and the Yakşas and the Rākşasa, shine on me ! May this my desire be granted me through your grace, O god of gods!</p>
<p id='16'>तव प्रसादाद् भवतु देवदेव ममेप्सुतम्। एवमस्त्विति देवेशो वाक्यमुक्त्वा गतस्तदा॥ प्राप्य चास्त्राणि देवेशाद् विश्वामित्रो महाबलः। दर्पण महता युक्तो दर्पपूर्णोऽभवत् तदा ॥<br />Thereupon, saying, 'Be it so' the lord of the celestials vanished. And obtaining the arms from the lord of the celestials, the mighty Viśvāmitra, naturally haughty, became swelled with insolence.</p>
<p id='17'>विवर्धमानो वीर्येण समुद्र इव पर्वणि। हतं मेने तदा राम वसिष्ठमृषिसत्तमम्॥<br />Surcharged with energy, like to the sea during the equinox, he considered, O Rāma, as if that foremost of saints, Vasistha, was already slain.</p>

<p id='20'>वसिष्ठस्य च ये शिष्या ये च वै मृगपक्षिणः। विद्रवन्ति भयाद् भीता नानादिग्भ्यः सहस्रशः॥<br />Vasiştha's disciples as well as the animals and birds inhabiting there, fled in all direction by thousands.</p>
<p id='21'>वसिष्ठस्याश्रमपदं शून्यमासीन्महात्मनः। मुहूर्तमिव निःशब्दमासीदीरिणसंनिभम्॥<br />For a time the hermitage of the high souled Vasiştha was bare of living beings, and still like to a wilderness.</p>
<p id='22'>वदतो वै वसिष्ठस्य मा भैरिति मुहुर्मुहुः। नाशयाम्यद्य गाधेयं नाहारमिव भास्करः॥<br />And Vasistha cried momentarily, 'Do not fear. To day will I slay Gadhi's son, even as the sun (destroys) mist.'</p>
<p id='23'>एवमुक्त्वा महातेजा वसिष्ठो जपतां वरः। विश्वामित्रं तदा वाक्यं सरोषमिदमब्रवीत्॥<br />Having said this, that best of mantra reciting ones, Vasistha, in high wrath, addressed Viśvāmitra, saying.</p>
