<h3>Bala Kanda: Chapter 33</h3><p id='1'>तस्य तद् वचनं श्रुत्वा कुशनाभस्य धीमतः। शिरोभिश्चरणो स्पृष्ट्वा कन्याशतमभाषत॥<br />Hearing those words of the intelligent Kusanābha, his hundred daughters touching his feet with their heads, said,</p>
<p id='2'>वायुः सर्वात्मको राजन् प्रधर्षयितुमिच्छति। अशुभं मार्गमास्थाय न धर्मं प्रत्यवेक्षते॥<br />O king, that life of all, the Air, was desirous of overcoming us, having recourse to an improper way; nor did he regard morality.</p>
<p id='3'>पितृमत्यः स्म भद्रं ते स्वच्छन्दे न वयं स्थिताः। पितरं नो वृणीष्व त्वं यदि नो दास्यते तव॥<br />We have a father, good betide you; and we live at ease. Do you ask our father about it, if he consent conferring us on you.</p>
<p id='4'>तेन पापानुबन्धेन वचनं न प्रतीच्छता। एवं ब्रुवन्त्यः सर्वाः स्म वायुनाभिहता भृशम्॥<br />But that wicked wight did not listen to our words; and as we were saying this, were we roughly handled by him.'</p>
<p id='5'>तासां तु वचनं श्रुत्वा राजा परमधार्मिकः। प्रत्युवाच महातेजाः कन्याशतमनुत्तमम्॥<br />Hearing those words of theirs, the highly pious and puissant king addressed his hundred beautiful daughters, saying</p>
<p id='6'>क्षान्तं क्षमावतां पुत्र्यः कर्तव्यं सुमहत् कृतम्। ऐकमत्यमुपागम्य कुलं चावेक्षितं मम॥<br />You have displayed a signal example of that forgiveness which is fit to be followed by the forbearing; and that you have unanimously regarded the honour of my house, also conduces to your praise.</p>
<p id='7'>अलंकारो हि नारीणां क्षमा तु पुरुषस्य वा। दुष्करं तच्च वै क्षान्तं त्रिदशेषु विशेषतः॥ यादृशी वः क्षमा पुत्र्यः सर्वासामविशेषतः।<br />Alike to men and women, forbearance is an ornament. And difficult it is for one to exercise that forbearance, specially in respect of the celestials. And may every descendant of mine possess forbearance like to yours!</p>
<p id='8'>क्षमा दानं क्षमा सत्यं क्षमा यज्ञाश्च पुत्रिकाः। क्षमा यशः क्षमा धर्मः क्षमायां विष्ठितं जगत्।<br />Forbearance is charity; forbearance is truth; forbearance, O daughters, is sacrifice; forbearance is fame; forbearance is virtue, you, the universe is established in forbearance;</p>
<p id='9'>विसृज्य कन्याः काकुत्स्थ राजा त्रिदशविक्रमः॥ मन्त्रज्ञो मन्त्रयामास प्रदानं सह मन्त्रिभिः। देशे काले च कर्तव्यं सदृशे प्रतिपादनम्॥<br />Then dismissing his daughters, the king endowed with the prowess of celestials, and versed in counsel, began to consult with his counsellors about the bestowal of his daughters, in respect of time and place and person and equability of lineage.</p>
<p id='10'>एतस्मिन्नेव काले तु चूली नाम महाद्युतिः। ऊर्ध्वरेताः शुभाचारो ब्राह्मं तप उपागमत्॥<br />It came to pass that at this time, an ascetic named Culi, highly effulgent, with his vital fluid under control, and of pure practices, was performing Brāhma austerities.</p>
<p id='11'>तपस्यन्तमृषिं तत्र गन्धर्वी पर्युपासते। सोमदा नाम भद्रं ते ऊर्मिलातनया तदा ॥<br />And as the saint was engaged in austerities, good betide you, Urmila's daughter named Somada-a Gandharvi-ministered to him.</p>
<p id='12'>सा च तं प्रणता भूत्वा शुश्रूषणपरायणा। उवास काले धर्मिष्ठा तस्यास्तुष्टोऽभवद् गुरुः॥<br />And in all humility that virtuous one for a definite period was engaged in ministering to him. And thereat, her spiritual guide was gratified with her.</p>
<p id='13'>स च तां कालयोगेन प्रोवाच रघुनन्दन। परितुष्टोऽस्मि भद्रं ते किं कमि तव प्रियम्॥<br />And, O descendant of Raghu, once he said to her, I am gratified, good betide you! What good shall I render you?</p>
<p id='14'>परितुष्टं मुनिं ज्ञात्वा गन्धर्वी मधुरस्वरम्। उवाच परमप्रीता वाक्यज्ञा वाक्यकोविदम्॥<br />Thereupon, concluding that the ascetic was gratified, the Gandharvi, cognizant of words, exceedingly delighted, sweetly addressed that one versed in speech.</p>
<p id='15'>लक्ष्म्या समुदितो ब्राह्मया ब्रह्मभूतो महातपाः। ब्राह्मण तपसा युक्तं पुत्रमिच्छामि धार्मिकम्॥<br />You are furnished with the Brāhma marks, art sprung from Brahmă, and art of mighty austerities. I desire of you a righteous son endowed with the Brāhma ascetic virtues.</p>
<p id='16'>अपतिश्चास्मि भद्रं ते भार्या चास्मि न कस्यचित्। ब्राह्मणोपगतायाश्च दातुमर्हसि मे सुतम्॥<br />I am without a husband, good betide you, and I am no one's wife. Upon me who is your servant you should confer such a son by help of Brāhma means.</p>
<p id='17'>तस्याः प्रसन्नो ब्रह्मर्षिर्ददौ ब्राह्ममनुत्तमम्। ब्रह्मदत्त इति ख्यातं मानसं चूलिनः सुतम्॥<br />Thereupon, well pleased with her, Cūlina conferred upon her an excellent Brāhma mindbegotten son, named Brahmadatta,</p>
<p id='18'>स राजा ब्रह्मदत्तस्तु पुरीमध्यवसत् तदा। काम्पिल्यां परया लक्ष्म्या देवराजो यथा दिवम्॥<br />And that king, Brahmadatta, founded the flourishing city of Kampilya, even as the sovereign of the celestials founded the celestial regions.</p>
<p id='19'>स बुद्धिं कृतवान् राजा कुशनाभः सुधार्मिकः। ब्रह्मदत्ताय काकुत्स्थ दातुं कन्याशतं तदा॥<br />And, O Kākutstha, the righteous king Kusanābha finally decided on conferring his hundred daughters upon Brahmadatta.</p>
<p id='20'>तमाहूय महातेजा ब्रह्मदत्तं महीपतिः। ददौ कन्याशतं राजा सुग्रीवेनान्तरात्मना ॥<br />And inviting Brahmadatta, that highly energetic lord of earth, with a glad heart conferred his hundred daughters upon him.</p>
<p id='21'>यथाक्रमं तदा पाणिं जग्राह रघुनन्दन। ब्रह्मदत्तो महीपालस्तासां देवपतिर्यथा ॥<br />And O descendant of Raghu, king Brahmadatta resembling the lord himself of the celestials, by turns received their hands in marriage.</p>
<p id='22'>स्पृष्टमात्रे तदा पाणौ विकुब्जा विगतज्वराः। युक्तं परमया लक्ष्म्या बभौ कन्याशतं तदा॥<br />And as soon as he touched them, the hundred daughters were cured of their crookedness, and became free from anguish, and were endowed with pre-eminent beauty.</p>
<p id='23'>स दृष्ट्वा वायुना मुक्ताः कुशनाभो महीपतिः। बभूव परमप्रीतो हर्षं लेभे पुनः पुनः॥<br />And upon beholding them delivered from (the tyranny of) the Air, the monarch Kušanābha became exceedingly delighted, and rejoiced again and again.</p>
<p id='24'>कृतोद्वाहं तु राजानं ब्रह्मदत्तं महीपतिम्। सदारं प्रेषयामास सोपाध्यायगणं तदा॥<br />And he dismissed that lord of earth, king Brahmadatta, in company with his consorts and the priests.</p>
<p id='25'>सोमदापि सुतं दृष्ट्वा पुत्रस्य सदृशीं क्रियाम्। यथान्यायं च गन्धवीं स्नुषास्ताः प्रत्यनन्दत। स्पृष्ट्वा च ताः कन्याः कुशनाभं प्रशस्य च॥<br />And the Gandharvī Somadā rejoiced exceedingly at the completion of the nuptials of her son; and embracing her daughters-in-law again and again, and extolling her son, she expressed the fullness of her joy. And he dismissed that lord of earth, king Brahmadatta, in company with his consorts and the priests.</p>
<p id='26'>सोमदापि सुतं दृष्ट्वा पुत्रस्य सदृशीं क्रियाम्। यथान्यायं च गन्धवीं स्नुषास्ताः प्रत्यनन्दत। स्पृष्ट्वा च ताः कन्याः कुशनाभं प्रशस्य च॥<br />And the Gandharvī Somadā rejoiced exceedingly at the completion of the nuptials of her son; and embracing her daughters-in-law again and again, and extolling her son, she expressed the fullness of her joy.</p>
