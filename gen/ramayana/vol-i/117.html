<p id='8'>लक्ष्मणं त्वेवमुक्त्वासौ संसिद्धं प्रियराघवम्। सुमित्रा गच्छ गच्छेति पुनः पुनरुवाच तम्॥ राम दशरथं विद्धि मां विद्धि जनकात्मजाम्। अयोध्यामटवीं विद्धि गच्छ तात यथासुखम्॥<br />Do you consider Rāma as Daśaratha, and Janaka's own-begotten as myself; do you regard Ayodhyā as a wilderness, go my son, at your sweet pleasure. Having thus spoken to that dear descendant of Raghu, who had made up his mind (to journey to the forest), Sumitra again and again said to him, “Go! Go!"</p>
<p id='9'>ततः सुमन्त्रः काकुत्स्थं प्राञ्जलिर्वाक्यमब्रवीत्। विनीतो विनयज्ञश्च मातलिसिवं यथा॥<br />Then like to Mātali addressing Väsava, that one understanding humility, Sumantra, with joined hands humbly said to Kākutstha.</p>
<p id='10'>रथमारोह भद्रं ते राजपुत्र महायशः। क्षिप्रं त्वां प्रापयिष्यामि यत्र मां राम वक्ष्यसे॥<br />O illustrious prince, good betide you: do you ascend the car. O Rāma, I will speedily take you to wherever you will tell me.</p>
<p id='11'>चतुर्दश हि वर्षाणि वस्तव्यानि वने त्वया। तान्युपक्रमितव्यानि यानि देव्या प्रचोदितः॥<br />You will have to spend fourteen years in the forest, and your stay must commence from this very day. So the noble lady has ordered.</p>

<p id='14'>तथैवायुधजातानि भ्रातृभ्यां कवचानि च। रथोपस्थे प्रविन्यस्य सचर्म कठिनं च यत्॥ अथो ज्वलनसंकाशं चामीकरविभूषितम्। तमारुरुहतुस्तूर्णं भ्रातरौ रामलक्ष्मणौ॥<br />And then he placed in front of the car various weapons, coats of mail, a basket bound in hide and a hoe, At length the brothers Rama and Laks maņa swiftly ascended the flaming car garnished with gold.</p>
<p id='15'>सीतातृतीयानारूढान् दृष्ट्वा रथमचोदयत्। सुमन्त्रः सम्मतानश्वान् वायुवेगसमाजवे॥<br />And seeing them with Sītā for the third, mounted, Sumantra drove the car yoked with goodly horses resembling the wind in celerity.</p>
<p id='16'>प्रयाते तु महारण्यं चिररात्राय राघवे। बभूव नगरे मूर्छा बलमूर्छा जनस्य च॥<br />On Rāghava having left for the forest to stay there for a long period, the men and beasts within the city were deprived of their senses (by grief).</p>
<p id='17'>तत् समाकुलसम्भ्रान्तं मत्तसंकुपितद्विपम्। हयसिञ्जितनिर्घोषं पुरमासीन्महास्वनम्॥<br />And in the city there arose a mighty tumult in consequence of the hurrying of people, the elephants waxing mad and furious, and the neighings of horses.</p>

<p id='20'>संयच्छ वाजिनां रश्मीन् सूत याहि शनैः शनैः। मुखं द्रक्ष्याम रामस्य दुर्दशं नो भविष्यति॥<br />O charioteer, rein in the horses, do you proceed softly. We will see the countenance of Rāma, which we shall never see again.</p>
<p id='21'>आयसं हृदयं नूनं राममातुरसंशयम्। यद् देवगर्भप्रतिमे वनं याति न भिद्यते॥<br />Surely the heart of Rāma's mother is made of iron, for it does not burst on witnessing her son resembling Skanda repairing to the forest.</p>
<p id='22'>कृतकृत्या हि वैदेही छायेवानुगता पतिम्। न जहाति रता धर्मे मेरुमर्कप्रभा यथा॥<br />Vaidehī, attaining her desire, follows her husband, like a shadow, attached to virtue, she does not forsake him, even as the Sun forsakes not Meru.</p>

<p id='35'>ततो हलहलाशब्दो यज्ञे रामस्य पृष्ठतः। नराणां प्रेक्ष्य राजानं सीदन्तं भृशदुःखितम्॥<br />Then seeing the sovereign senseless and stricken with exceeding sorrow, the multitudes at the rear of Rāma broke out into a loud tumult.</p>
<p id='36'>हा रामेति जनाः केचिद् राममातेति चापरे। अन्तःपुरसमृद्धं च क्रोशन्तं पर्यदेवयन्॥<br />And seeing the king weeping aloud with the inmates of the inner apartment, some exclaiming "Oh Rama," and others, “O Rāma's mother," began to be-wail.</p>
<p id='37'>अन्वीक्षमाणो रामस्तु विषण्णं भ्रान्तचेतसम्। राजानं मातरं चैव ददर्शानुगतौ पथि॥<br />Then turning back, Rāna saw that his sorrowstricken and bewildered father along with his mother, was following his track.</p>
<p id='38'>स बद्ध इव पाशेन किशोरो मातरं यथा। धर्मपाशेन संयुक्तः प्रकाशं नाभ्युदैक्षत॥<br />As a colt fastened in a snare cannot see its mother, so Rāma fastened in the bonds of virtue could not look at his mother openly.</p>

<p id='42'>तथा रुदन्ती कौसल्यां रथं तमनुधावतीम्। क्रोशन्ती राम रामेति हा सीते लक्ष्मणेति च॥ रामलक्ष्मणसीतार्थं स्रवन्तीं वारि नेत्रजम्। असकृत् प्रेक्षत सतां नृत्यन्तीमिव मातरम्॥<br />Rāma beheld his mother Kausalyā running after the car, bewailing aloud, “Rāma, Rāma, Ah Sītā, Lakşmaņa,” shedding tears for Rāma, Laks maņa and Sītā, and appearing as if she had been dancing incessantly.</p>
<p id='43'>तिष्ठेति राजा चुक्रोश याहि याहीति राघवः। सुमन्त्रस्य बभूवात्मा चक्रयोरिव चान्तरा॥<br />The king exclaimed, "Stay,” Rāghava said, "On, On." Sumantra's mind vacillated like that of one placed between two hosts burning to encounter each other.</p>
<p id='44'>नाश्रौषमिति राजानमुपालब्धोऽपि वक्ष्यसि । चिरं दुःखस्य पापिष्ठमिति रामस्तमब्रवीत्॥<br />Rāma said to him, “When taxed by the monarch (on your return), you will say, 'I did not hear you.' But delay will impart me terrible pain."</p>

<p id='46'>न्यवर्तत जनो राज्ञो रामं कृत्वा प्रदक्षिणम्। मनसाप्याशुवेगेन न न्यवर्तत मानुषम्॥<br />The retainers of the king stopped after circumambulating Rāma, but their minds did not turn back. But the others did not return either bodily or mentally.</p>
<p id='47'>यमिच्छेत् पुनरायातं नैनं दूरमनुव्रजेत्। इत्यमात्या महाराजमूचुर्दशरथं वचः॥ तेषां वचः सर्वगुणोपपत्रः प्रस्विनगात्रः प्रविषण्णरूपः। निशम्य राजा कृपणः सभार्यो व्यवस्थितस्तं सुतमीक्षमाणः॥<br />Then the courtiers said to that mighty monarch, Dasaratha, “He that is expected back should not be followed far". Hearing their words, the king endued with every virtue, with his body covered with perspiration and his countenance woebegone, and exceedingly distressed, stopped short and stood with his wife looking at his son</p>
