<h3>Ayodhya Kanda: Chapter 2</h3><p id='1'>ततः परिषदं सर्वामामन्त्र्य वसुधाधिपः। हितमुद्धर्षणं चैवमुवाच प्रथितं वचः॥ दुन्दुभिस्वरकल्पेन गम्भीरेणानुनादिना। स्वरेण महता राजा जीमूत इव नादयन्॥ राजलक्षणयुक्तेन कान्तेनानुपमेन च। उवाच रसयुक्तेन स्वरेण नृपतिर्नुपान्॥<br />Then facing his whole court, that lord of earth, the king, resounding all sides as if with thunder, in a mighty voice, echoing, and solemn, and like to the sounds of a kettle-drum, spoke words fraught with welfare, and capable of creating high rapture, and worthy of the attention of all. And in tones overflowing with royal signs; and mellifluous; and peerless; and surcharged with the sentiment of surprise, the monarch addressed the princes, saying.</p>

For different is the thought of the dispassionate; and by friction becomes far more efficacious.* *This is Mill's principle of free and equal discussion so lucidity upheld in his Liberty. The meaning in the text is obscurely expressed. The thought of the dispassionate is different from that of the passionate; and truth comes out from the friction of the two opposite forces.</p>
<p id='14'>इति ब्रुवन्तं मुदिताः प्रत्यनन्दन् नृपा नृपम्। वृष्टिमन्तं महामेघं नर्दन्त इव बर्हिणः॥<br />As the king had said this, the princes, exceedingly delighted, seconded him even as peacocks dance at sight of a mighty mass of clouds showering down rain.</p>
