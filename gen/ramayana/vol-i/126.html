<h3>Ayodhya Kanda: Chapter 49</h3><p id='1'>रामोऽपि रात्रिशेषेण तेनैव महदन्तरम्। जगाम पुरुषव्याघ्रः पितुराज्ञामनुस्मरन्॥<br />That best of men, Rāma, remembering his father's commanded cleared a large tract of country before the night terminated.</p>
<p id='2'>तथैव गच्छतस्तस्य व्यपायाद् रजनी शिवा। उपास्य तु शिवां संध्यां विषयानत्यगाहत॥<br />And as he went on, the auspicious night was spent. And then having offered up his devotions to the beneficent Sandhyā, Rāma entered into another country.</p>
<p id='3'>ग्रामान् विकृष्टसीमान्तान् पुष्पितानि वनानि च। पश्यन्नतिययौ शीघ्रं शनैरिव हयोत्तमैः॥<br />And seeing villages having ploughed fields on their skirts, and powering woods, he by means of those excellent horses, proceeded very fast although seeming to go slowly.</p>
<p id='4'>शृण्वन् वाचो मनुष्याणां ग्रामसंवासवासिनाम्। राजानं धिग् दशरथं कामस्य वशमास्थितम्।।४<br />And as Rāma proceeded,* he heard the villagers speaking to each other, saying, Fie on king Dasaratha, who has yielded himself up to lust! *The N.W.P. text has an additional couplet:, How will that exalted lady, Janaka's daughter, ever engaged in enjoyment, bear misery?</p>
<p id='5'>हा नृशंसाद्य कैकेयी पापा पापानुबन्धिनि । तीक्ष्णा सम्भिन्नमर्यादा तीक्ष्णकर्मणि वर्तते॥ या पुत्रमीदृशं राज्ञः प्रवासयति धार्मिकम्। वनवासे महाप्राज्ञं सानुक्रोशं जितेन्द्रियम्॥<br />Ah! the rebutless, fell and sinful Kaikeyi intent upon impiety, having put by her honour, has resolved upon an exceedingly atrocious deed, she that exiles into the woods such a virtuous son of the monarch, endowed with high wisdom, kind, and having his senses under control.* *The N.W.P. text has an additional line: And of the reprehensible Kaikeyi intent upon cruel deeds.</p>
<p id='6'>कथं नाम महाभागा सीता जनकनन्दिनी। सदा सुखेष्वभिरता दुःखान्यनुभविष्यति ॥ अहो दशरथो राजा निःस्नेहः स्वसुतं प्रति। प्रजानामनघं रामं परित्यक्तुमिहेच्छति॥<br />Alas! king Daſaratha has no affection for his own son, since wishes to dismiss from hence Rāma sinless and dear to the subjects.</p>
<p id='7'>एता वाचो मनुष्याणां ग्रामसंवासवासिनाम्। शृण्वन्नतिययौ वीरः कोसलान् कोसलेश्वरः॥ ततो वेदश्रुतिं नाम शिववारिवहां नदीम्। उत्तीर्याभिमुखः प्रायादगस्त्याध्युषितां दिशम्॥<br />Hearing these words of the villagers, that hero, the lord of Kosala, left Kosala behind him. Then crossing the river Vedaśruti of sacred waters, Rāma went in the direction of the quarter in which Agastya resided. (South)</p>
<p id='8'>गत्वा तु सुचिरं कालं ततः शीतवहां नदीम्। गोमती गोयुतानूपामतरत् सागरङ्गमाम्॥<br />Then proceeding for a good while, he crossed the cool flowing stream Gomati running in the direction of the ocean, with its banks filled with kine and inundating its edge.</p>
<p id='9'>गोमती चाप्यतिक्रम्य राघवः शीघ्रगैर्हयैः। मयूरहंसाभिरुतां ततार स्यन्दिकां नदीम्॥<br />Having passed the Gomatī, Rāghava by means of fleet-coursing horses next crossed over the river Sandika resounding with the cries of cranes and peacocks.</p>
<p id='10'>स महीं मनुना राज्ञा दत्तामिक्ष्वाकवे पुरा । स्फीतां राष्ट्रवृतां रामो वैदेहीमन्वदर्शयत्॥<br />Here Rāma showed to Vaidehi those flourishing regions that had formerly been conferred by king Manu on Ikşvāku, and which teemed with populous tracts.</p>
<p id='11'>सूत इत्येव चाभाष्य सारथिं तमभीक्ष्णशः। हंसमत्तस्वरः श्रीमानुवाच पुरुषोत्तमः॥<br />Then frequently addressing the charioteer, saying, "O Suta", that best of men furnished with grace and endowed with a voice like that of a mad swan, spoke.</p>
<p id='12'>कदाहं पुनरागम्य सरय्वाः पुष्पिते वने। मृगयां पर्यटिष्यामि मात्रा पित्रा च संगतः॥<br />When shall I coming back, range a hunting the blossoming groves of the Sarayū, along with my father and mother?</p>
<p id='13'>नात्यर्थमभिकाङ्क्षामि मृगयां सरयूवने। रतिद्देषातुला लोके राजर्षिगणसम्मता॥<br />I do not so much long for hunting in the woods of the Sarayū; but a relish (for the pastime) is considered as beyond compare being held in esteem by the Rājarşis.</p>
<p id='14'>राजर्षीणां हि लोकेऽस्मिन् रत्यर्थ मृगया वने। काले कृतां तां मनुजैर्धन्विनामभिकासिताम्॥<br />Hunting in the forest was introduced for the recreation of Rāghavas. Yet do I not take beyond measure to the chase which has been followed in season by the descendants of Manu and which is ever coveted by bowmen.</p>
<p id='15'>स तमध्वानमैक्ष्वाकः सूतं मधुरया गिरा। तं तमर्थमभिप्रेत्य ययौ वाक्यमुदीरयन्॥<br />Taking this subject, the descendant of Ikşvāku passed the way, addressing sweet words to the charioteer.</p>
