<h3>Ayodhya Kanda: Chapter 105</h3><p id='1'>ततः पुरुषसिंहानां वृतानां तैः सुद्गणैः। शोचतामेव रजनी दुःखेन व्यत्यवर्तत॥ रजन्यां सुप्रभातायां भ्रातरस्ते सुहृद्वताः। मन्दाकिन्यां हुतं जप्यं कृत्वा राममुपागमन्॥<br />As those foremost of persons surrounded by their friends indulged in lamentations, the night passed away in grief. On the night being succeeded by an auspicious morning, those brothers surrounded by their friends, having performed Homa and Japa on the Mandākinī, returned to Rāma.</p>
<p id='2'>तूष्णीं ते समुपासीना न कश्चित् किंचिदब्रवीत्। भरतस्तु सुहृन्मध्ये रामं वचनमब्रवीत्॥<br />And sitting silent, no one said anything. Then Bharata addressed Rāma in the midst of those friends, saying.</p>
<p id='3'>सान्त्विता मामिका माता दत्तं राज्यमिदं मम। तद् ददामि तवैवाहं भुक्ष्व राज्यमकण्टकम्॥<br />My mother was (first) pacified (by grant to the kingdom.) The kingdom is (now) mine. I grant the same to you. Do you enjoy the kingdom rid of its thorns.</p>
<p id='4'>महतेवाम्बुवेगेन भिन्नः सेतुर्जलागमे। दुरावरं त्वदन्येन राज्यखण्डमिदं महत्॥<br />Like to a dyke forced by a torrent during the rains, this mighty monarchy is difficult of being protected save by you.</p>
<p id='5'>गतिं खर इवाश्वस्य तार्थ्यस्येव पतत्त्रिणः। अनुगन्तुं न शक्तिर्मे गतिं तव महीपते॥<br />As a mule is incapable of imitating the course of a horse, or as birds, that of Tarksya, I, O Lord of earth, lack the strength to imitate you.</p>
<p id='6'>सुजीवं नित्यशस्तस्य यः परैरुपजीव्यते। राम तेन तु दुर्जीवं यः परानुपजीवति॥<br />O Rāma, ever happy is the life of him that others depend upon for subsistence: unhappy is the life of the person that depends upon others for support.</p>
<p id='7'>यथा तु रोपितो वृक्षः पुरुषेण विवर्धितः। ह्रस्वकेन दुरारोहो रूढस्कन्धो महादुमः॥ स यदा पुष्पितो भूत्वा फलानि न विदर्शयेत्। स तां नानुभवेत् प्रीतिं यस्य हेतोः प्ररोपितः॥ एषोपमा महाबाहो तदर्थ वेत्तुमर्हसि। यत्र त्वमस्मान् वृषभो भर्ता भृत्यान् न शाधि हि॥<br />As a tree planted by a person, and by him made to increase, (until at last), sending out branches, a mighty tree, it is incapable of being got up by a dwarf; and then if, flowering, it show no fruits, it cannot contribute to the satisfaction of him for whom it has been planted. O mightyarmed one, this comparison is meant for you. This* it behoves you to apprehend, inasmuch as you are our excellent lord, and you do not teach us who depend upon you for support. *The import of the image.</p>
<p id='8'>श्रेणयस्त्वां महाराज पश्यन्त्वग्र्याश्च सर्वशः। प्रतपन्तमिवादित्यं राज्यस्थितमरिंदमम्॥<br />Let the principal orders, O monarch, behold you, represser of foes, established in the kingdom, like the powerful sun himself.</p>
<p id='9'>तथानुयाने काकुत्स्थ मत्ता नर्दन्तु कुञ्जराः। अन्तःपुरगता नार्यो नन्दन्तु सुसमाहिताः॥<br />O Kākutstha, let mad elephants roar, with the view of following you; and let the women of the inner apartments with concentrated rainds utter jubilation.</p>
<p id='10'>तस्य साध्वनुमन्यन्त नागरा विविधा जनाः। भरतस्य वचः श्रुत्वा रामं प्रत्यनुयाचतः॥<br />On hearing the words of Bharata, who was beseeching Rāma, many of the citizens expressed their approbation by exclaiming, “Excellent well!"</p>
<p id='11'>तमेवं दुःखितं प्रेक्ष्य विलपन्तं यशस्विनम्। रामः कृतात्मा भरतं समाश्वासयदात्मवान्॥<br />Seeing the illustrious Bharata aggrieved and engaged in lamentation, the calm and considerate Rāma consoled him, saying.</p>
<p id='12'>नात्मन: कामकारो हि पुरुषोऽयमनीश्वरः। इतश्चेतरतश्चैनं कृतान्तः परिकर्षति॥<br />No creature is endowed with the power of exercising any control over the course of events, man has no independent status (in nature).</p>
<p id='13'>सर्वे क्षयान्ता निचयाः पतनान्ताः समुच्छ्याः। संयोगा विप्रयोगान्ता मरणान्तं च जीवितम्॥<br />The Destroyer draw him both here and hereafter. Those that increase, are destined to deteriorate; those that go upward, ultimately fall, those that come together, separate in the end; and life at length meet with death.</p>
<p id='14'>यथा फलानां पक्वानां नान्यत्र पतनाद् भयम्। एवं नरस्य जातस्य नान्यत्र मरणाद् भयम्॥<br />As a ripe fruit has no other fear than fall, so man who is born, has no other fear than death.</p>
<p id='15'>यथाऽऽगारं दृढस्थूणं जीर्णं भूत्वोपसीदति। तथावसीदन्ति नरा जरामृत्युवशंगताः॥<br />Even as a stout-pillared edifice, getting dilapidated, waxes weak, so men coming under the sway of decrepitude and death, get enfeebled.</p>
<p id='16'>अत्येति रजनी या तु सा न प्रतिनिवर्तते। यात्येव यमुना पूर्ण समुद्रमुदकार्णवम्॥<br />A night that has gone by, does not return, as the full Yamunā, when she has entered the ocean, does not come back.</p>
<p id='17'>अहोरात्राणि गच्छन्ति सर्वेषां प्राणिनामिह। आयूंषि क्षपयन्त्याशु ग्रीष्मे जलमिवांशवः॥<br />In this world, days and nights pass away with creatures, and speedily impair their lives, even as in summer the rays (of the sun) (dry up) the waters.</p>
<p id='18'>आत्मानमनुशोच त्वं किमन्यमनुशोचसि। आयुस्तु हीयते यस्य स्थितस्यास्य गतस्य च॥<br />Do you therefore deplore yourself. Why do you lament any thing else? Every one's life is decreasing, whether he sits or moves.</p>
<p id='19'>सहैव मृत्युजति सह मृत्युनिषीदति। गत्वा सुदीर्घमध्वानं सह मृत्युर्निवर्तते ॥<br />Death goes with one, sits down with one, and after having gone a long way, returns with one.</p>
<p id='20'>गात्रेषु वलयः प्राप्ताः श्वेताश्चैव शिरोरुहाः। जरया पुरुषो जीर्णः किं हि कृत्वा प्रभावयेत्॥<br />The person is filled with folds in the skin, the hair has grown hoary, the individual is enfeebled because of age, by doing what, can be prevent this?</p>
<p id='21'>नन्दन्त्युदित आदित्ये नन्दन्त्यस्तमितेऽहनि। आत्मनो नावबुध्यन्ते मनुष्या जीवितक्षयम्॥<br />People rejoice on the rising of the sun; they feel delighted at the approach of night, but they do not understand that their lives have (meanwhile) been shortened.</p>
<p id='22'>हृष्यन्त्य॒तुमुखं दृष्ट्वा नवं नवमिवागतम्। ऋतूनां परिवर्तेन प्राणिनां प्राणसंक्षयः॥<br />People are exhilarated at the commencement of a new season of novel fashion; creatures get their lives shortened at the change of season.</p>
<p id='23'>यथा काष्ठं च काष्ठं च समेयातां महार्णवे। समेत्य तु व्यपेयातां कालमासाद्य कंचन॥ एवं भार्याश्च पुत्राश्च ज्ञातयश्च वसूनि च। समेत्य व्यवधावन्ति ध्रुवो ह्येषां विनाभवः॥<br />As on the mighty ocean, one piece of wood comes in contact with another; so, a person, having been in association with another, is separated from him in time. In this way, wives and sons and kindred and wealth, having been in association, go away; their separation is certain.</p>
<p id='24'>नात्र कश्चिद् यथाभावं प्राणी समतिवर्तते। तेन तस्मिन् न सामर्थ्य प्रेतस्यास्त्यनुशोचतः॥<br />There exists not one in this world that can change one's nature as received. A person lamenting a dead individual, has no power to prevent his own death.</p>
<p id='25'>यथा हि सार्थं गच्छन्तं ब्रूयात् कश्चित् पथि स्थितः। अहमप्यागमिष्यामि पृष्ठतो भवतामिति ॥ एवं पूर्वैर्गतो मार्गः पैतृपितामहैध्रुवः। तमापन्नः कथं शोचेद् यस्य नास्ति व्यतिक्रमः॥ वयसः पतमानस्य स्रोतसो वानिवर्तिनः। आत्मा सुखे नियोक्तव्यः सुखभाजः प्रजाः स्मृताः।।३१।<br />As while one is proceeding on a road, another stationed by the way, says, 'I too will go in your wake,' even so, the way that has been followed by our predecessors, (must be followed as well by us.) Why should people mourn for deceased relatives), when they are themselves subject to the fate that knows no turning? (Perceiving the destruction of) life declining, like to a current that never turns back, one should engage his soul in happiness; for all men are said to be born for the same.</p>
<p id='26'>धर्मात्मा सुशुभैः कृत्स्नैः क्रतुभिश्चाप्तदक्षिणैः। धूतपापो गतः स्वर्गं पिता नः पृथिवीपतिः॥<br />My child, our righteous sire, who, after having performed excellent and entire sacrifices, accompanied with Dakșiņās, has repaired to heaven, honoured of he good, should not be mourned.* *The N.W.P. text has seven additional lines here, wanting in the other texts:, “That lord of the earth, our father Dasaratha, has gone to heaven. On account of having adequately maintained his servants and governed his subjects, and virtuously given away wealth, our sire has gone to heaven. And by virtue of supremely excellent and desirable acts, and sacrifices accompanied with Dakşiņā, that master of this world, our father Dasaratha, has ascended heaven. And having celebrated many sacrifices and enjoyed luxuries, that lord of the earth, having attained a goodly age, has gone to heaven."</p>
<p id='27'>भृत्यानां भरणात् सम्यक् प्रजानां परिपालनात्। अर्थादानाच्च धर्मेण पिता नस्त्रिदिवं गतः॥<br />Having renounced his human frame wasted and worn out with age, our father has attained celestial state, which exists in the regions of Brahma.</p>
<p id='28'>कर्मभिस्तु शुभैरिष्टैः क्रतुभिश्चाप्तदक्षिणैः। स्वर्ग दशरथः प्राप्तः पिता नः पृथिवीपतिः॥ इष्ट्वा बहुविधैर्यज्ञैर्भोगांश्चावाप्य पुष्कलान्। उत्तमं चायुरासाद्य स्वर्गतः पृथिवीपतिः॥ आयुरुत्तममासाद्य भोगानपि च राघवः। न स शोच्यः पिता तात स्वर्गतः सत्कृतः सताम्।।३६। स जीर्णमानुषं देहं परित्यज्य पिता हि नः। दैवीमृद्धिमनुप्राप्तो ब्रह्मलोकविहारिणीम्॥ तं तु नैवंविधः कश्चित् प्राज्ञः शोचितुमर्हसि। त्वद्विधो मद्विधश्चापि श्रुतवान् बुद्धिमत्तर॥ एते बहुविधाः शोका विलापरुदिते तदा। वर्जनीया हि धारेण सर्वावस्थासु धीमता॥ स स्वस्थो भव मा शोको यात्वा चावस तां पुरीम्। तथा पित्रा नियुक्तोऽसि वशिना वदतां वर॥ यत्राहमपि तेनैव नियुक्तः पुण्यकर्मणा। तत्रैवाहं करिष्यामि पितुरार्यस्य शासनम्॥<br />Such an one should never be mourned by any wise person like you or myself, accomplished in learning and more than ordinarily intelligent. Such manifold grief and mourning and lamentation should be renounced by intelligent and firm persons in all conditions in life. Do you cast off this grief: let not sorrow overpower you. Going thither, stay in that city. And, O best of speakers, this was also enjoined by our sire of controlled sense. I also must do my noble father's will as to whatever that one of pious acts has laid upon me.</p>
<p id='29'>न मया शासनं तस्य त्यक्तुं न्याय्यमरिंदम। स त्वयापि सदामान्यः स बन्धुः स नः पिता॥<br />O subduer foes, it is not proper for me to pass by his orders. So they are also worthy of being honoured by you. He is our friend and father.</p>
<p id='30'>तद् वचः पितुरेवाहं सम्मतं धर्मचारिणाम्। कर्मणा पालयिष्यामि वनवासेन राघव॥<br />O descendant of Raghu, that mandate of our righteous father, acceptable to me, will I obey by abiding in the woods.</p>
<p id='31'>धार्मिकेणानृशंसेन नरेण गुरुवर्तिना। भवितव्यं नरव्याघ्र परलोकं जिगीषता॥<br />O foremost of men, (good in the next world is capable of being attained by an honest and pious person crowned with sterling virtues, ever following his superiors.</p>
<p id='32'>आत्मानमनुतिष्ठ त्वं स्वभावेन नरर्षभ। निशाम्य तु शुभं वृत्तं पितुर्दशरथस्य नः॥<br />O best of men, thinking that our father Dasaratha has attained excellent state, do you, resorting to all noble qualities, seek your welfare in the next world.</p>
<p id='33'>इत्येवमुक्त्वा वचनं महात्मा पितुर्निदेशप्रतिपालनार्थम्। यवीयसं भ्रातरमर्थवच्च प्रभुर्मुहूर्ताद् विरराम रामः॥<br />Having said these significant words to his younger brother, with the view of making him obey the injuctions of their father, that lord, the magnanimous Rāma, paused.</p>
