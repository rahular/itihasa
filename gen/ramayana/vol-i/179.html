<h3>Ayodhya Kanda: Chapter 102</h3><p id='1'>रामस्य वचनं श्रुत्वा भरतः प्रत्युवाच ह। किं मे धर्माद् विहीनस्य राजधर्मः करिष्यति॥<br />Hearing Rāma's words, Bharata answered, Deprived of the kingdom in consequence of my posteriority in point of birth, what does regard for morality avail me?</p>
<p id='2'>शाश्वतोऽयं सदा धर्मः स्थितोऽस्मासु नरर्षभ। ज्येष्ठ पुत्रे स्थिते राजा न कनीयान् भवेनृपः॥<br />O best of men, even this morality has ever been established with reference to us, viz., that the eldest son of the king existing, a younger one cannot be the king.</p>
<p id='3'>स समृद्धां मया सार्धमयोध्यां गच्छ राघव। अभिषेचय चात्मानं कुलस्यास्य भवाय नः॥<br />Do you, therefore, O Rāghava go along with me to the prosperous Ayodhya; and get yourself ir stalled there for the behoof of our race.</p>
<p id='4'>राजानं मानुषं प्राहुर्देवत्वे सम्मतो मम। यस्य धर्मार्थसहितं वृत्तमाहुरमानुषम्॥<br />Although a king observing interest and virtue, and who towers above average humanity, has been called a mortal, yet to me he is a very deity.</p>
<p id='5'>केकयस्थे च मयि तु त्वयि चारण्यमाश्रिते। धीमान् स्वर्गं गतो राजा यायजूकः सतां मतः॥<br />While I was in Kekaya and you was in the forest that intelligent monarch honoured of the good, given to celebrating sacrifices, ascended heaven.</p>
<p id='6'>निष्क्रान्तमात्रे भवति सहसीते सलक्ष्मणे। दुःखशोकाभिभूतस्तु राजा त्रिदिवमभ्यगात्॥<br />As soon as you had set out (for the forest) along with Sītā and Lakşmaņa, the king borne down by grief and chagrin, went to heaven.</p>
<p id='7'>उत्तिष्ठ पुरुषव्याघ्र क्रियतामुदकं पितुः। अहं चायं च शत्रुघ्नः पूर्वमेव कृतोदकौ॥<br />O foremost of men, do you arise, and offer water to the spirit of our sire. Śatrughna and I have ere this offered water to (the departed).</p>
<p id='8'>प्रियेण किल दत्तं हि पितृलोकेषु राघव। अक्षयं भवतीत्याहुर्भावांश्चैव पितुः प्रियः॥<br />O Rāghava, anything offered to the (manes of the) ancestors by a beloved descendant, conduces to their eternal behoof; and you the favourite of our father.</p>
<p id='9'>स्त्वय्येव सक्तामनिवर्त्य बुद्धिम्। स्त्वां संस्मरन्नेव गतः पिता ते॥<br />Mourning you and exceedingly desirous of seeing you, his mind being fastened on you and incapable of being turned away, deprived of you, and smitten with grief of your account, your father departed this life, remembering you. was</p>
