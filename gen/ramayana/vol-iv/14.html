<p id='3'>संनिविष्टं गिरौ तस्मिन्राक्षसेन्द्रं निशम्य तु। युद्धेप्सुं तं कृतोत्साहं दुरात्मानं समन्त्रिणम्॥ यक्षा न शेकुः संस्थातुं प्रमुखे तस्य रक्षसः। राज्ञो भ्रातेति विज्ञाय गता यत्र धनेश्वरः॥<br />And hearing that wicked-minded lord of Räks asas, breathing high spirits, had arrived at the mount in company with his counsellors, the Yakşas could not stay before that Rākşasa, and knowing this one is the king's brother,' went to where the lord of riches was.</p>

<p id='6'>ततो युद्धं समभवद्यक्षराक्षससंकुलम्। व्यथिताश्चाभवंस्तत्र सचिवा राक्षसस्य ते।।।<br />And then there took place an encounter between the Yakşas and the Räksasa were smitten fiercely.</p>
<p id='7'>स दृष्ट्वा तादृशं सैन्यं दशग्रीवो निशाचरः। हर्षनादान्बहून्कृत्वा स क्रोधादभ्यभाषत॥<br />And finding his forces in that plight, Daśagrīva set up full many a cheerful shout and in wrath began to speak.</p>
<p id='8'>ये तु ते राक्षसेन्द्रस्य सचिवा घोरविक्रमाः। तेषां सहस्रमेकैको यक्षाणां समयोधयत्॥<br />Each of the terrific and mightiest councillors of the Rākşasa-chief, coped with a thousand Yaksas.</p>
<p id='9'>ततो गदाभिर्मुसलैरसिभिः शक्तितोमरैः। हन्यमानो दशग्रीवास्तत्सैन्यं समगाहत॥ स निरुच्छ्वासवत्तत्र वध्यमानो दशाननः। वर्षद्भिरिव जीमूतैर्धाराभिरवरुध्यत॥ न चकार व्यथां चैव यक्षशस्त्रैः समाहतः। महीधर इवाम्भोदैर्धाराशतसमुक्षितः॥<br />And then struck with maces and clubs and swords and darts and tomaras, the Ten-necked one dived into (that deep) of a host. And rendered inert and sore assailed, Daśānana was deprived of his movements with volleys of weapons resembling torrents of rain. And albeit drenched with blood streaming dowli in hundreds of torrents, he like a mountain flooded with a downpour, being wounded with the weapons of the Yakşa, does not betray any smart.</p>
<p id='10'>स महात्मा समुद्यस्य कालदण्डोपमां गदाम्। प्रविवेश ततः सैन्यं नयन्यक्षान्यमक्षयम्॥<br />And that high-souled one, raising up his mace resembling the rod itself of Time, entered into that army, despatching Yakşas to the abode of Yama.</p>
<p id='11'>स कक्षमिव विस्तीर्णं शुष्कन्धनमिवाकुलम्। वातेनाग्निरिवादीप्तो यक्षसैन्यं ददाह तत्.।१५।।<br />And as a flaming fire burn up an extensive sward of grass stocked with dry fire-wood, he began to consume that Yakşa army.</p>

<p id='13'>केचित्समाहता भिन्नाः पतिताः समरे क्षितौ। ओष्ठांश्च दशनैस्तीक्ष्णैरदशन्कुपिता रणे॥ श्रान्ताश्चान्योन्यमालिङ्गय भ्रष्टशस्त्रा रणाजिरे। सीदन्ति च तदा यक्षाः कूला इव जलेन ह॥<br />And some were wounded, and (some) broken down, and (some) measured their lengths on the ground in the encounter, and other Yakşas deprived of their arms in the field, being fatigued, sank down, embracing each other, even as banks drop down, on being worn away by water.</p>
<p id='14'>हतानां गच्छतां स्वर्ग युध्यतामथ धावताम्। प्रेक्षतामृषिसङ्घानां बभूव न तदान्तरम्॥<br />And no room was left (in the sky) in consequence of its being thronged by hosts of sages; and warriors, wounded and rushing for conflict, and (finally) ascending heaven.* *The idea of the author is: "The welkin was thronged with sages as well as warriors, who swelled the ranks of the sages stationed in the sky, by ascending heaven after having fallen in fight.”</p>

<p id='20'>स वार्यमाणो यक्षेण प्रविवेश निशाचरः। यदा तु वारितो राम न व्यतिष्ठत्स राक्षसः॥ ततस्तोरणमुत्पाट्य तेन यक्षेण ताडितः। रुधिरं प्रस्रवन्भाति शैलो धातुस्रवैरिव॥<br />And albeit prevented, the nigh-ranger entered in. And when O Rama, that Raksasa was prevented, he did not stay. And then struck by that Yaksa with the gate-way uprooted, he, discharging blood in streams, looked like a hill with minerals running on it.</p>
<p id='21'>स शैलशिखराभेण तोरणेन समाहतः। जगाम न क्षतिं वीरो वरदानात्स्वयंभुवः॥<br />And hit with that gate-way resembling a mountain-summit in splendour, that hero did not sustain any injury, on account of the boon he had received from the Self-sprung.</p>
<p id='22'>तेनैव तोरणेनाथ यक्षस्तेनाभिताडितः। नादृश्यत तदा यक्षो भस्मीकृततनुस्तदा ॥<br />And on being struck by the same gate-way, the Yakșa ceased to be seen, his body having then been consumed to ashes.</p>
<p id='23'>ततः प्रदुद्रुवुः सर्वे दृष्ट्वा रक्षःपराक्रमम्। ततो नदीर्गुहाश्चैव विविशुर्भयपीडिताः। त्यक्तप्रहरणाः श्रान्ता विवर्णवदनास्तदा॥<br />And witnessing the prowess of the Rākșasa, all began to flee; and then they afflicted with affright, fatigued, and with pale faces entered into rivers and caves, leaving their arms behind.</p>
