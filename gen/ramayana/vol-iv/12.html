<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>ददौ तां कालकेन्द्राय दानवेन्द्राय राक्षसीम्। स्वसां शूर्पणखां नाम विद्युज्जिह्वाय राक्षसः॥<br />Then that Raksasa bestowed his sister, the Rākşasī Śūrpanakhā, on that lord of the Dänavas and king of the Kālakeśa Vidyujjihvä.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>अथ दत्त्वा स्वयं रक्षो मृगयामटते स्म तत्। तत्रापश्यत्ततो राम मयं नाम दितेः सुतम्॥ कन्यासहायं तं दृष्ट्वा दशग्रीवो निशाचरः। अपृच्छत्को भवानेको निर्मनुष्यमृगे वने॥ अनया मृगशावाक्ष्या किमर्थं सह तिष्ठसि। मयस्तदाब्रवीद्राम पृच्छन्तं तं निशाचरम्॥<br />Having given her away, the Rākşasa was wandering about for the purpose of hunting, when, o Rāma, he happened to see Diti's son, named Maya. And seeing him accompanied by his daughter, that night-ranger the Ten-necked one asked him, saying, 'Who are you that (wanderest) alone in this first devoid of men as well as deer? And are you accompanied by this one having the eyes of a young deer?' Thereat Maya, O Rama, answered that nightranger, when he had asked this.</p>

I shall tell you all about this. You may ere this have heard of an Apsarā named Hemā. She like to the Paulomi of Satakratu was bestowed on me, by the gods. And I passed a thousand years, being devoted her. Thirteen years have passed away since she had gone on a business of the celestials, as also the fourteenth year. Then I through my extraordinary skill constructed a golden palace, adorned with diamond and lapises. There I dwelt, aggrieved and sorrowful on account of her separation.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>तस्मात्पुरा दुहितरं गृहीत्वा वनमागतः। इयं ममात्मजा राजंस्तस्याः कुक्षौ विवर्धिता॥<br />From then, taking my daughter, I have come to this wood. This, O king, is my daughter, grown in her womb.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>भर्तारमनया सार्धमस्याः प्राप्तोऽस्मि मार्गितुम्। कन्यापितृत्वं दुःखं हि सर्वेषां मानकाङ्क्षिणाम्॥ कन्या हि द्वे कुले नित्यं संशये स्थाप्य तिष्ठति।<br />I have come hither with her, seeing of her husband. Verily being father to a daughter is misery to everyone that seekes one's honour. A daughter, forsooth, stayes, ever placing the two lines* in uncertainity. *The lines, namely, of her father and mother. The line of a mother as distinct from that of a father would be impossible under the present economy of Hindu society inasmuch as, as soon as a girl is married, she by that ceremony leaves her father's line and becomes incorporated with that of her husband. But this seems to have been otherwise in ancient times, This opens up an interesting social problem for the research of orientalists.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>पुत्रद्वयं ममाप्यस्यां भार्यायां संबभूव ह॥ मायावी प्रथमस्तात दुन्दुभिस्तदनन्तरः।<br />On this wife of mine I have also beget two sons. The first is Māyāvī and the next Dundubhi.</p>

<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>एवमुक्तस्तदा राम राक्षसेन्द्रेण दानवः। महर्षेस्तनयं ज्ञात्वा मयो दानवपुङ्गवः॥ दातुं दुहितरं तस्मै रोचयामास तत्र वै।<br />Thus accosted, O Rama, by that lord of Raks asas, that Dänava and foremost of Dānavas, Maya; learning that he was the son of Maharsi, Paulastya, there desired in his heart to give away his daughter to him.</p>
