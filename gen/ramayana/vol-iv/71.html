<p id='20'>न तु कौतूहलाद्युक्तमन्वेष्टं तं महामुनिम्। एवं तद्वाक्यमुक्त्वा तु सैनिकान् रघुनन्दनः। अभिवाद्य महर्षि तं स्वं निवेशं ययौ तदा॥<br />It is not therefore becoming to ask him about this our of curiosity. Having thus addressed the soldiers and bowed to the ascetic, Satrughna, the descendant of Raghu, entered his own quarter.</p>
