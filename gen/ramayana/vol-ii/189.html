<h3>Sundara Kanda: Chapter 50</h3><p id='1'>तमुवीक्ष्य महाबाहुः पिङ्गाक्षं पुरतः स्थितम्। रोषेण महताऽऽविष्टो रावणो लोकरावणः॥<br />Seeing the tawny-eyed one staying before him, the mighty-armed Ravana, affrighter of (the worlds), was overwhelmed with fierce wrath.</p>
<p id='2'>शङ्काहतात्मा दध्यौ स कपीन्द्रं तेजसा वृतम्। किमेष भगवान् नन्दी भवेत् साक्षादिहागतः॥ येन शप्तोऽस्मि कैलासे मया प्रहसिते पुरे। सोऽयं वानरमूर्तिः स्यात्किंस्विद् बाणोऽपि वासुरः॥<br />And gazing at that foremost of monkeys girt with power, and with his soul exercised with apprehension, he (thought), “Is this the worshipful Nandi, come hither in person, by whom I, on my jeering at him, had formerly been cursed in Kailāsa? (Rāvaņa had formerly laughed at Nandi for his monkey-face) Or is this one wearing the shape of a monkey Vāli's son, Bāņa?"</p>
<p id='3'>स राजा रोषताम्राक्षः प्रहस्तं मन्त्रिसत्तमम्। कालयुक्तमुवाचेदं वचो विपुलमर्थवत्॥<br />And with his eyes coppery with rage, the king asked his foreniost counsellor Prahasta, in words fraught with sense and suiting the season,</p>
<p id='4'>दुरात्मा पृच्छयतामेष कुतः किं वास्य कारणम्। वनभङ्गे च कोऽस्यार्थो राक्षसानां च तर्जने ॥ मत्पुरीमप्रधृष्यां वै गमने किं प्रयोजनम्। आयोधने वा किं कार्यं पृच्छयतामेष दुर्मतिः॥<br />Ask this wicked-minded one, whence is he? And what led him to ravage the grove, and what was his object in brow-beating the Rākşasas? And what has been his purpose in entering my metropolis incapable of being subdued; and what for did he also fight (with my retainers?) Do you ask the wicked-minded one about this.</p>
<p id='5'>रावणस्य वचः श्रुत्वा प्रहस्तो वाक्यमब्रवीत्। समाश्वसिहि भद्रं ते न भीः कार्या त्वया कपे॥<br />Hearing Ravana's speech, Prahasta said, “Take heart! Fair fortune to you! You need not be alarmed, O monkey."</p>
<p id='6'>यदि तावत् त्वमिन्द्रेण प्रेषितो रावणालयम्। तत्त्वमाख्याहि मा ते भूद् भयं वानर मोक्ष्यसे॥<br />If you had been sent to Rāvana's residence by Indra, tell us truly everything. Let no fear, O imonkey, be yours. You shall be liberated.</p>
<p id='7'>यदि वैश्रवणस्य त्वं यमस्य वरुणस्य च। चारुरूपमिदं कृत्वा प्रविष्टो नः पुरीमिमाम्॥ विष्णुना प्रेषितो वापि दूतो विजयकाक्षिणा। नहि ते वानरं तेजो रूपमात्रं तु वानरम्॥<br />If you belong to Vaisravana, or to Yama, or to Varuņa, and had entered into this city of ours disguising (your proper shape), or if you had been despatched by Vişnu burning for victory, (tell us this truly). Your prowess is certainly not hat of a monkey, your form alone is that of a monkey.</p>
<p id='8'>तत्त्वतः कथयस्वाद्य ततो वानर मोक्ष्यसे। अनृतं वदतश्चापि दुर्लभं तव जीवितम्॥ अथ वा यन्निमित्तस्ते प्रवेशो रावणालये। एवमुक्तो हरिवरस्तदा रक्षोगणेश्वरम्॥ अब्रवीन्नास्मि शक्रस्य यमस्य वरुणस्य च। धनदेन न मे सख्यं विष्णुना नास्मि चोदितः॥<br />Unfold this (to us) faithfully, O monkey, and you shall get (back) your liberty. But if you should say aught untruthful, your life shall pay dear for it. Or tell us wherefore you had entered into Rāvana's mansion. Thus addressed then that foremost of monkeys said to the lord of Rāks asas, “I am not Sakra's, nor Yama's, nor Varuna's. I have no friendship with Dhanada, (Lit.-giver of wealth-a designation of Kubera) nor have I been despatched by Visnu.</p>
<p id='9'>जातिरेव मम त्वेषा वानरोऽहमिहागतः। दर्शने राक्षसेन्द्रस्य तदिदं दुर्लभं मया॥ वनं राक्षसराजस्य दर्शनार्थे विनाशितम्। ततस्ते राक्षसाः प्राप्ता बलिनो युद्धकाटिणः॥ रक्षणार्थं च देहस्य प्रतियुद्धा मया रणे।<br />This is my race; and I have come hither a monkey for obtaining a, sight of the Rākṣasa chief. And it is to attain a sight of the Rākṣasa lord that I have destroyed his peerless grove; and it is for this that, the powerful Rākşasas seeking for fight, I for the preservation of my person have resisted them in conflict.</p>
<p id='10'>अस्त्रपाशैर्न शक्योऽहं बद्धं देवासुरैरपि॥ पितामहादेष वरो ममापि हि समागतः।<br />I am incapable of being slain with weapons even by the celestials and the Asuras themselves. This boon I also (like yourself) happen to have received from the Great-father.</p>
<p id='11'>राजानं द्रष्टकामेन मयास्त्रमनुवर्तितम्॥ विमुक्तोऽप्यहमस्त्रेण राक्षसैस्त्वभिवेदितः।<br />It is because I was desirous of seeing the king that I have suffered this weapon to restrain me. Although the Rākşasas have brought me (hither thus), yet I am free from any weapon (restraining me).</p>
<p id='12'>केनचिद् रामकार्येण आगतोऽस्मि तवान्तिसम्॥ दूतोऽहमिति विज्ञाय राघवस्यामितौजसः। श्रूयतामेव वचनं मम पथ्यमिदं प्रभो॥<br />I come near you on a certain business of Rāma. Knowing me for a messenger of Rāghava endowed with measureless prowess, do you, O lord, listen to my words, calculated to work your profit.</p>
