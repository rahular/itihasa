<h3>Kishkinda Kanda: Chapter 63</h3><p id='1'>एतैरन्यैश्च बहुभिर्वाक्यैर्वाक्यविशारदः। मां प्रशस्याभ्यनुज्ञाप्य प्रविष्टः स स्वमालयम्॥<br />Having praised me with these and many other words, and bidden me adieu that one skilled in speech, entered his own habitation.</p>
<p id='2'>कन्दरात् तु विसर्पित्वा पर्वतस्य शनैः शनैः। अहं विन्ध्यं समारुह्य भवतः प्रतिपालये॥<br />Issuing out gently from the cave of that mountain, I, ascending Vindhya, was expecting you.</p>
<p id='3'>अद्य त्वेतस्य कालस्य वर्षे साग्रशतं गतम्। देशकालप्रतीक्षोऽस्मि हृदि कृत्वा मुनेर्वचः॥<br />The space covered by the time intervening between then and to-day is a little over an hundred years;* and laying up in my heart the speech of that ascetic I have been awaiting season and place. *The commentator says the period is one hundred and eight years.</p>
<p id='4'>महाप्रस्थानमासाद्य स्वर्गते तु निशाकरे।-मां निर्दहति संतापो वितर्कंबहुभिर्वृतम्॥<br />Setting out on his great journey, on Niśākara having gone to heaven, I distracted with various thoughts, have been consumed by grief. For the loss of my plumage.-</p>
<p id='5'>उदितां मरणे बुद्धिं मुनिवाक्यैर्निवर्तये। बुद्धिर्या तेन मे दत्ता प्राणानां रक्षणे मम॥ सा मेऽपनयते दुःखं दीप्तेवाग्निशिखा तमः।<br />My rising intention of doing away with myself I have suppressed in consideration of the words of the ascetic. The reason which he had imparted to me for preserving my life, has removed my pains even as a flaming fire (dispels darkness).</p>
<p id='6'>बुध्यता च मया वीर्यं रावणस्य दुरात्मनः॥ पुत्रः संतर्जितो वाग्भिर्न त्राता मैथिली कथम्।<br />And knowing the prowess of the impious Rāvana, I said in rage to my son, versed in speech,-'Hearing her lamentation, and knowing them bereft of Sītā, why didst you not deliver her?'</p>
<p id='7'>तस्या विलपितं श्रुत्वा तौ च सीतावियोजितौ॥ न मे दशरथस्नेहात् पुत्रेणोत्पादितं प्रियम्।<br />My son did not do this good office to Daſaratha, influenced by affection for him.</p>
<p id='8'>तस्य त्वेवं ब्रुवाणस्य संहतैर्वानरैः सह ॥ उत्पेततुस्तदा पक्षौ समक्षं वनचारिणाम्।<br />As he was speaking thus in the midst of the monkeys, his wings sprang up in presence of the rangers of the forest.</p>
<p id='9'>स दृष्ट्वा स्वां तनुं पक्षरुद्तैररुणच्छदैः॥ प्रहर्षमतुलं लेभे वानरांश्चेदमब्रवीत्।<br />Thereupon, seeing his person furnished with grown pinions hued like the infant sun, he experienced incomparable raptures, and addressed the monkeys, saying,</p>
<p id='10'>निशाकरस्य राजर्षेः प्रसादादमितौजसः॥ आदित्यरश्मिनिर्दग्धौ पक्षौ पुनरुपस्थितौ।<br />By the grace of that Rājarși of immeasurable energy, my wings, which had been burnt up by the rays of the sun, have grown again.</p>
<p id='11'>यौवने वर्तमानस्य ममासीद् यः पराक्रमः॥ तमेवाद्यावगच्छामि बलं पौरुषमेव च।<br />To-day I have got back) the strength and prowess which I possessed while my youth was yet present.</p>
<p id='12'>सर्वथा क्रियतां यत्नः सीतामधिगमिष्यथ ॥ पक्षलाभो ममायं वः सिद्धिप्रत्ययकारकः।<br />Do you strive every way. You shall meet with Sītā. And my getting (back) my wings inspires (us) with confidence as to success.</p>
<p id='13'>इत्युक्त्वा तान्हरीन् सर्वान्सम्पाति: पतगोत्तमः॥ उत्पपात गिरेः शृङ्गाजिज्ञासुः खगमो गतिम्।<br />Having said this to all the monkeys, that ranger of the sky and best of birds. Sampāti, anxious to ascertain his power of flight, flew up from the mountain summits.</p>
<p id='14'>तस्य तद् वचनं श्रुत्वा प्रतिसंहृष्टमानसाः। बभूवुर्हरिशार्दूला विक्रमाभ्युदयोन्मुखाः॥<br />Hearing his words, those powerful monkeys, with vigour (enhanced, seeing success before them, felt the height of joy.</p>
<p id='15'>अथ पवनसमानविक्रमाः प्लवगवराः प्रतिलब्धपौरुषाः। र्जनकसुतापरिमार्गणोन्मुखाः॥<br />Then those foremost of monkeys, in vigour resembling the Wind, getting occasion for displaying their prowess, intent upon searching the Janaka's daughter, set forward towards the quarter crested by Abhijit.* * Abhijitabhimukhan (acc.) Abhijit—the name of a star. Abhijit may also mean-he who is to be conquered. Then the sense would be the region in which Rāvana was.</p>
