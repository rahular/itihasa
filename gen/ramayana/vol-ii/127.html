<h3>Kishkinda Kanda: Chapter 54</h3><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>तथा ब्रुवति तारे तु ताराधिपतिवर्चसि। अथ मेने हृतं राज्यं हनूमानङ्गदेन तत्॥<br />When Tārā, bright as the moon, had spoken thus, Hanumān felt as if Angada had already deprived (Sugrīva) of his kingdom.* The sense is very obscure. One meaning is: Hanumān thought that Argada acquiescing in what Tārā had said, must remain there,-and ultimately endeavour to wrest the kingdom from Sugriva. Another meaning is: Hanumān conceived that remaining there in peace, Angada would consider his position as enviable as if he had extorted the kingdom from Sugrīva.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>बुद्ध्या ह्यष्टाङ्गया युक्तं चतुर्बलसमन्वितम्। चतुर्दशगुणं मेने हनूमान् वालिनः सुतम्॥ आपूर्यमाणं शश्वच्च तेजोबलपराक्रमैः। शशिनं शुक्लपक्षादौ वर्धमानमिव श्रिया॥ बृहस्पतिसमं बुद्ध्या विक्रमे सदृशं पितुः। शुश्रूषमाणं तारस्य शुक्रस्येव पुरंदरम्॥<br />Hanumān deemned Vāli's son as endowed with intelligence consisting of eight elements; with power of four kinds; and the four and ten virtues; as ever fraught with energy, strength and prowess; as growing in grace like the moon during the lighted fortnight; as resembling Brhaspati in intelligence; and in prowess, his own sire; and as ever listening to. Tārā's counsels, as Purandara listens to the counsels of Sukra.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>भर्तुरर्थे परिश्रान्तं सर्वशास्त्रविशारदः। अभिसंधातुमारेभे हनूमानङ्गदं ततः॥<br />And Hanumān versed in all branches of learning, finding Angada backward in the affair of his master, began inspire him with fear.* *Touching Tārā.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>स चतुर्णामुपायानां द्वितीयमुपवर्णयन्। भेदयामास तान् सर्वान् वानरान् वाक्यसम्पदा॥<br />He, wealthy in words, laying under contribution the second of the four means,* had created division among those monkeys. *Referred to above.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>तेषु सर्वेषु भिन्नेषु ततोऽभीषयदङ्गदम्। भीषणैर्विविधैर्वाक्यैः कोपोपायसमन्वतैः॥<br />On their being divided, he (Hanuman) set about raising Angada's apprehension by various fear-fraught speech, referring to punishments.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>त्वं समर्थतरः पित्रा युद्धे तारेय वै ध्रुवम्। दृढं धारयितुं शक्तः कपिराज्यं यथा पिता॥<br />O Tārā's son, you are for certain more capable of fight than even your sire; and you are also able to hold the monkey-kingdom as firmly as he.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>नित्यमस्थिरचित्ता हि कपयो हरिपुंगव। नाज्ञाप्यं विषहिष्यन्ति पुत्रदारं विना त्वया॥<br />But, O foremost of monkeys, the monkeys are always inconstant in character. Bereft of their wives and sons, they shall not bear your behest.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>त्वं नैते ह्यनुरञ्जेयुः प्रत्यक्षं प्रवदामि ते। यथाऽयं जाम्बवान् नीलः सुहोत्रश्च महाकपिः॥ नाहं ते इमे सर्वे सामदानादिभिर्गुणैः। दण्डेन न त्वया शक्याः सुग्रीवादपकर्षितुम् ॥<br />They shall never take to you. This I tell you in presence of all. And I will tell you what. You neither by the virtues of conciliation, charity and the rest, nor by chastisement, shall succeed in drawing to your side this Jāmbavān, or Nīla, or the mighty ape Suhotra, or myself.</p>

<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>स्वल्पं हि कृतमिन्द्रेण क्षिपता ह्यशनिं पुरा। लक्ष्मणो निशितैर्बाणैर्भिन्द्यात् पत्रकुटं यथा॥<br />Formerly this was cleft a little by Indra, with his thunderbolt hurled (against it);* but now Lakṣmaṇa would pierce it like a leaf-stalk, by means of his keen arrows. *The commentator interprets the passage differently: Formerly Indra did a little damage herein-i.e. merely slew Maya, the architect of the mansion. This is ingenuity. I give the plain sense.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>लक्ष्मणस्य च नाराचा बहवः सन्ति तद्विधाः। वज्राशनिसमस्पर्शा गिरीणामपि दारकाः॥<br />Lakşmaņa has many an iron arrow like Indra's thunderbolt or that of the sky,* capable of riving even mountains. 15 *Vajrasani-Vajra is the thunder-bolt in the hand of Indra, and Asani—the thunder-bolt produced by clouds.</p>

If you make head (against Sugriva), the sharpened shafts of Laksmana, terrible, of exceeding impetuosity and mighty vehemence, and incapable of being baffled, shall be eager to slay you.</p>
