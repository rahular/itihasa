And you are preserved by the prowess of your arms, and protected also by your ascetic merit; and being skilled in the knowledge of season and place, you, methinks, are the foremost of them all in intelligence.</p>
<p id='5'>न तेऽस्त्यशक्यं समरेषु कर्मणां न तेऽस्त्यकार्यं मतिपूर्वमन्त्रणे। न सोऽस्ति कश्चित् त्रिषु संग्रहेषु न वेद यस्तेऽस्त्रबलं बलं च॥<br />There is no deed which you cannot perform in the field; and there is nothing in counsel capable of being arrived at by arguing on the lines prescribed by the scriptures, which you are not equal to; and there is none in all the three worlds who dose not know your strength and prowess in arms.</p>

O destroyer of foes, my mind did not feel the same confidence in them that I do in you. (According to another reading, the meaning would be:-"O best of warriors, do you, considering your own strength and that of the enemy, so exert yourself that he may no longer inflict terrible losses on our army.” (Tirtha)) And seeing this mighty host slain, as well as the prowess and energy of the monkey, and the taking into consideration your own strength, do you put forth your energy according to your strength.</p>

Neither can it avail to use arms of terrific power and resembling the thunderbolt. Nothing can resist the rush of the Wind-god's offspring, and this one like to fire is incapable of being slain with weapons.</p>

(One should know in what branches of knowledge one's enemy is proficient, and, understanding this, one should strive for victory.)</p>

<p id='47'>अथेन्द्रजित्तं दुमचीरबद्धं विचार्य वीरः कपिसत्तमं तम्। मन्येन बद्धोऽप्यनुवर्ततेऽस्त्रम्॥ अहो महत्कर्म कृतं निरर्थं न राक्षसैर्मन्त्रगतिर्विमृष्टा। पुनश्च नास्त्रे विहतेऽस्त्रमन्यत् प्रवर्तते संशयिताः स्म सर्वे॥<br />Beholding that best of monkeys tied up with bark and liberated from the binding of the weapon Indrajit reflected that the binding force of the Brahma weapon became powerless when there was any other binding. “Alas, (those Räkşas) have rendered my mighty deed fruitless. They know not the action of Mantras. (That the action of a Brahma mantra upon one is multified if one is bound physically) And on the Brahma weapon being baffled, any other weapon cannot effect anything; and thus we thus we have all been placed in a critical predicament."</p>
<p id='48'>अस्त्रेण हनुमान् मुक्तो नात्मानमवबुध्यते। कृष्यमाणस्तु रक्षोभिस्तैश्च बन्धैर्निपीडितः॥ हन्यमानस्ततः क्रूरै राक्षसैः कालमुष्टिभिः। समीपं राक्षसेन्द्रस्य प्राकृष्यत स वानरः॥<br />On being released from the weapon, Hanumān did not betray any signs of his liberation, albeit he was pulled by the Rākşasas and pained by the bonds they had bound him with. And the monkey, Hanumān, was pulled by those cruel Rākṣasas having fatal boxes, in the direction of the lord of Rākşasas.</p>

<p id='50'>तं मत्तमिव मातङ्गं बद्धं कपिवरोत्तमम्। राक्षसा राक्षसेन्द्राय रावणाय न्यवेदयन्॥<br />And the Rākṣasas related to the ruler of Rākșas everything touching that foremost of choice monkeys, resembling a mad elephant who was in bonds.</p>
<p id='51'>कोऽयं कस्य कुतो वापि किंकार्यं कोऽभ्युपाश्रयः। इति राक्षसवीराणां दृष्ट्वा संजज्ञिरे कथाः॥<br />“Who is he? And whose son? And where from? And what's his errand? And by whom is he backed?” Thus did the heroic Rākşasas converse on beholding Hanumān.</p>
<p id='52'>हन्यतां दह्यतां वापि भक्ष्यतामिति चापरे। राक्षसास्तत्र संक्रुद्धाः परस्परमथाब्रुवन्॥ अतीत्य मार्ग सहसा महात्मा स तत्र रक्षोधिपपादमूले। ददर्श राज्ञः परिचारवृद्धान् गृहं महारत्नविभूषितं च।५७।।<br />And others said, "Kill him," "Burn him," "Eat him up". The Raksasas, growing enraged, thus said to each other. Having passed some way, that magnanimous one saw there old servants sitting at the feet of the lord of Rākşasas, as well as a mansion embellished with countless jewels.</p>
<p id='53'>स ददर्श महातेजा रावणः कपिसत्तमम्। रक्षोभिर्विकृताकारैः कृष्यमाणमितस्ततः॥<br />And the exceedingly energetic Rāvana saw that foremost of monkeys dragged hither and thither by Rākṣasas of frightful forms.</p>
<p id='54'>राक्षसाधिपतिं चापि ददर्श कपिसत्तमः। तेजोबलसमायुक्तं तपन्तमिव भास्करम्॥<br />And that best of monkeys too saw that lord of Rākşasas, endowed with strength and energy and resembling the resplendent sun.</p>
<p id='55'>दशाननस्तं कपिमन्ववेक्ष्य। अथोपविष्टान् कुलशीलवृद्धन् समादिशत् तं प्रतिमुख्यमन्त्री॥<br />And with his reddened eyes rolling, the tennecked one, gazing at that monkey, ordered his principal counsellors, boasting of high pedigree and noble character, (to interrogate the incomer).</p>
<p id='56'>यथाक्रमं तैः स कपिश्च पृष्टः कार्यार्थमर्थस्य च मूलमादौ। निवेदयामास हरिश्वरस्य दूतः सकाशादहमागतोऽस्मि॥<br />And by turns questioned by them as to his mission and purpose, as well as the fundamental occasion (of his in road), that foremost of monkeys replied, “A messenger, I come (from Sugriva.)"</p>
