<h3>Sundara Kanda: Chapter 59</h3><p id='1'>एतदाख्याय तत् सर्वं हनूमान् मारुतात्मजः। भूयः समुपचक्राम वचनं वक्तुमुत्तरम्॥<br />Having related all, Hanuman, the wind-god's son began again, saying.</p>
<p id='2'>सफलो राघवोद्योगः सुग्रीवस्य च सम्भ्रमः। शीलमासाद्य सीताया मम च प्रीणितं मनः॥<br />Fruitful is Rāghava's endeavour and Sugrīva's energy, for greatly pleased have I been with Sita's conduct.</p>
<p id='3'>आर्यायाः सदृशं शीलं सीतायाः प्लवगर्षभाः। तपसा धारयेल्लोकान् क्रुद्धा वा निर्दहेदपि॥<br />O heroic monkeys, Sītā has been keeping the life of a highly chaste damsel. She can maintain the animated creation by virtue of her asceticism and burn it with her ire.</p>
<p id='4'>सर्वथातिप्रकृष्टोऽसौ रावणो राक्षसेश्वरः। यस्य तां स्पृशतो गात्रं तपसा न विनाशितम्॥<br />Rāvana, the lord of the Rākşasas is also highly advanced in asceticism by virtue whereof he has not been ruined albeit he has touched Sītā's person.</p>
<p id='5'>न तदग्निशिखा कुर्यात् संस्पृष्टा पाणिना सती। जनकस्य सुता कुर्याद् यत् क्रोधकलुषीकृता॥<br />Even the flame of fire cannot do, although touched by the hands, what Janaka's daughter can bring about by her ire.</p>
<p id='6'>जाम्बवत्प्रमुखान् सर्वाननुज्ञाप्य महाकपीन्। अस्मिन्नेवंगते कार्ये भवतां च निवेदिते। न्याय्यं स्म सह वैदेह्या द्रष्टुं तौ पार्थिवात्मजौ॥<br />I have related to you what had happened. It now behove us to behold Vaidehi along with those two sons of a king, after commanding all the monkeys headed by Jambavan and others.</p>
<p id='7'>अहमेकोऽपि पर्याप्तः सराक्षसगणां पुरीम्। तां लङ्कां तरसा हन्तुं रावणं च महाबलम्॥ किं पुनः सहितो वीरैर्बलवद्भिः : कृतात्मभिः। कृतास्त्रैः प्लवगैः शक्तैर्भवद्भिर्विजयैषिभिः॥<br />I am alone capable of destroying the city of Lankā along with the Rākşasas and their lord Rāvana. What more can I achieve if I am accompanied by the heroic monkeys like ye, powerful, having control over their own minds, well-arıned, able and desirous of winning victory!</p>
<p id='8'>अहं तु रावणं युद्धे ससैन्यं सपुरःसरम्। सहपुत्रं वधिष्यामि सहोदरयुतं युधि॥<br />I shall slay Răvaņa in conflict along with his sons, brothers army and retinue.</p>
<p id='9'>ब्राह्ममस्त्रं च रौद्रं च वायव्यं वारुणं तथा। यदि शक्रजितोऽस्त्राणि दुर्निरीक्ष्याणि संयुगे। तान्यहं निहनिष्यामि विधमिष्यामि राक्षसान्॥<br />I shall destroy all the Rākşasas and baffle all the weapons of Indrajit conferred on him by Brahmā, Rudra, wind and Varuņa albeit they are invisible in battle.</p>
<p id='10'>भवतामभ्यनुज्ञातो विक्रमो मे रुणद्धि तम्। मयातुला विसृष्टा हि शैलवृष्टिर्निरन्तरा॥ देवानपि रणे हन्यात् किं पुनस्तान् निशाचरान्।<br />Without your perinission my prowess has been bought to a stand still. Hills and mountains, uprooted and discharged by me continually, can destroy even the celestials, what of those nightrangers?</p>
<p id='11'>भवतामननुज्ञातो विक्रमो मे रुणद्धि माम्॥ सागरोऽप्यतियाद् वेलां मन्दरः प्रचलेदपि। न जाम्बवन्तं समरे कम्पयेदरिवाहिनी॥<br />Without your permission my prowess has been bought to a stand still. Even if the ocean overflow its banks, the Mount Mandara move off its place, the enemy's host cannot frighten Jāmbavăn in conflict.</p>
<p id='12'>सर्वराक्षससङ्घानां राक्षसा ये च पूर्वजाः। अलमेकोऽपि नाशाय वीरो बालिसुतः कपिः॥<br />And specially the heroic monkey, Vali's son, is alone capable of destroying the whole host of the Raksasas.</p>
<p id='13'>प्लवगस्योरूवेगेन नीलस्य च महात्मनः। मन्दरोऽप्यवशीर्येत किं पुनयुधि राक्षसाः॥<br />Even the mount Mandra is weakened by the velocity of the thighs of the high-souled monkey Nīla-what of the Rākşasas in conflict?</p>
<p id='14'>सदेवासुरयक्षेषु गन्धर्वोरगपक्षिषु। मैन्दस्य प्रतियोद्धारं शंसत द्विविदस्य वा॥<br />What hero is there among the celestials, Asuras, Yaksas, Gandharvas, serpents and birds who can equal Manida or Dvivida in battle?</p>
<p id='15'>अश्विपुत्रौ महावेगावेतौ प्लवगसत्तमौ। एतयोः प्रतियोद्धारं न पश्यामि रणाजिरे॥<br />I do not find any one who can oppose in the battle field the two best monkeys, the sons of Asvi gifted with great velocity.</p>
<p id='16'>मयैव निहता लङ्का दग्धा भस्मीकृता पुरी। राजमार्गेषु सर्वेषु नाम विश्रावितं मया॥ जयत्यतिबलो रामो लक्ष्मणश्च महाबलः। राजा जयति सुग्रीवो राघवेणाभिपालितः॥ अहं कोसलराजस्य दासः पवनसम्भवः। हनूमानिति सर्वत्र नाम विश्रावितं मया॥<br />By me along has the city Lankā been devastated burnt down and reduced to ashes. And I had announced in the public streets there—“May victory crown the highly powerful Ram and Lakşmaņa, and may the king Sugrīva advance in prosperity being protected by Rāghava. I am the servant of the king of Kosala, the own begotten son of the Wind-God and my name is Hanumān. I have announced thus everywhere.”</p>
<p id='17'>अशोकवनिकामध्ये रावणस्य दुरात्मनः। अधस्ताच्छिशपामूले साध्वी करुणमास्थिता॥<br />(And I beheld there) in the Asoka forest of the vicious-souled Rāvana, at the foot of a ſingśapā tree, the chaste Sītā waiting very poorly.</p>
<p id='18'>राक्षसीभिः परिवृता शोकसंतापकर्शिता। मेघरेखापरिवृता चन्द्ररेखेव निष्प्रभा॥<br />She was encircled by the Rākṣasīs, worn out with grief and anxiety and was like to the rays of the Moon shorn of their brilliance being enveloped with clouds.</p>
<p id='19'>अचिन्तयन्ती वैदेही रावणं बलदर्पितम्। पतिव्रता च सुश्रोणी अवष्टब्धा च जानकी॥<br />And Vaidehi, having a beautiful waist and devoted to her husband, did not care for Rāvana proud of his prowess and was accordingly confined by him.</p>
<p id='20'>अनुरक्ता हि वैदेही रामे सर्वात्मना शुभा। अनन्यचित्ता रामेण पौलोमीव पुरन्दरे॥<br />And that graceful daughter of the king of Vaidehī was by all means devoted to her lord and had all her thoughts centred in him like to Paulomi (The wife of Indra the lord of the celestials who was confined by the king Nahușa) devoted to her lord Purandara.</p>
<p id='21'>तदेकवासःसंवीता रजोध्वस्ता तथैव च। सा मया राक्षसीमध्ये तय॑माना मुहुर्मुहुः॥ राक्षसीभिर्विरूपाभिर्दृष्टा हि प्रमदावने। एकवेणीधरा दीना भर्तृचिन्तापरायणा॥ अधःशय्या विवर्णाङ्गी पद्मिनीव हिमोदये। रावणाद् विनिवृत्तार्था मर्दव्यकृतनिश्चया॥<br />And I saw her in that garden, wearing a single piece of cloth soiled with dirt, surrounded by the Rākşasīs and remonstrated with now and then by those ugly demons. Having a single braid of hair, poorly, engaged in thoughts touching her lord, she was lying on the earth shorn of all grace like to a lotus on the appearance of the winter. She had not the least attachment for Rāvana and was resolved upon putting an end to her existence.</p>
<p id='22'>कथंचिन्मृगशावाक्षी विश्वासमुपपादिता। ततः सम्भाषिता चैव सर्वमर्थं प्रकाशिता॥<br />And somehow creating her confidence I addressed that damsel having the eyes of a fawn and related to her the whole story.</p>
<p id='23'>रामसुग्रीवसख्यं च श्रुत्वा प्रीतिमुपागता। नियतः समुदाचारो भक्तिभर्तरि चोत्तमा॥ यन्न हन्ति दशग्रीवं स महात्मा दशाननः। निमित्तमात्रं रामस्तु वधे तस्य भविष्यति ॥<br />And hearing of the friendship between Rāma and Sugrīva she attained to an excess of delight. She is well behaved and devoted to her lord per excellence and blessed is the high-souled and ten-necked demon that she has not destroyed him (yet). And Rama shall become an instrument only in in bringing about his destruction.</p>
<p id='24'>सा प्रकृत्यैव तन्वङ्गी तद्वियोगाच्च कर्शिता। प्रतिपत्पाठशीलस्य विद्येव तनुतां गता॥<br />She has really been greatly reduced and worn out by the separation of her lord. Her person has been shattered like to learning waning by its prosecution on the first day of a lunar fortnight.</p>
<p id='25'>एवमास्ते महाभागा सीता शोकपरायणा। यदत्र प्रतिकर्तव्यं तत् सर्वमुपकल्प्यताम्॥<br />Thus live there the great Sītă worn out with grief. Do you now perform what you think proper.</p>
