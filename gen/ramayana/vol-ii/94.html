<h3>Kishkinda Kanda: Chapter 21</h3><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>ततो निपतिता तारां च्युतां तारामिवाम्बरात्। शनैराश्वासयामास हनुमान् हरियूथपः॥<br />Thereupon beholding Tārā fallen (on the ground) like to a star dropt down from the sky, Hanumān, the lord of monkey-herds, consoled her again and again.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>गुणदोषकृतं जन्तुः स्वकर्मफलहेतुकम्। अव्यग्रस्तदवाप्नोति सर्वं प्रेत्य शुभाशुभम्॥<br />Animals unagitated, attain to happiness or misery, as an outcome of their actions performed (in their previous existence) by merits or demerits.</p>

Why did you feel commiseration for the poor, yourself being poorly? In this body like to a bubble who is there who mourneth for another?</p>

<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>जानास्यनियतामेवं भूतानामागतिं गतिम्। तस्माच्छुभं हि कर्तव्यं पण्डितेनेह लौकिकम्॥<br />Do you know that life and death of the animals is very unsettled. It is therefore proper to perform what tends to the welfare of after-life. It does not behove you, O learned damsel, to mourn like others.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>यस्मिन् हरिसहस्राणि शतानि नियुतानि च। वर्तयन्ति कृताशानि सोऽयं दिष्टान्तमागतः॥<br />He even, who (while living) was surrounded by thousands of monkeys cherishing hopes, has met his destined end.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>यदयं न्यायदृष्टार्थः सामदानक्षमापरः। गतो धर्मजितां भूमिं नैनं शोचितुमर्हसि ॥<br />This hero discharged his royal duties in consonance with the sanctions of morality and was gifted with various kingly accomplishments such as conciliation, clarity and forgiveness. He has attained to the land of kings and it becomes you not to mourn for him.</p>

And abiding by your commandments let Angada govern the earth.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>संततिश्च यथा दृष्टा कृत्यं यच्चापि साम्प्रतम्। राज्ञस्तत् क्रियतां सर्वमेष कालस्य निश्चयः॥<br />Let Angada perform all those ceremonies, which should be gone through by sons according to the Šāstras and which are for the well-being of the king; this is the time for the performance of those funeral rites.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>संस्कार्यो हरिराजस्तु अङ्गदश्चाभिषिच्यताम्। सिंहासनगतं पुत्रं पश्यन्ती शान्तिमेष्यसि॥<br />Performing the funeral ceremonies of the lord of monkeys do you install Angada. And beholding your son thus established on the throne you shall be able to pacify your grief?</p>

<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>नह्येषा बुद्धिरास्थेया हनूमन्नङ्गदं प्रति। पिता हि बन्धुः पुत्रस्य न माता हरिसत्तम ॥<br />O Hanumān, do you not consider that I shall confer this kingdom upon Angada-0 best of monkeys, father is son's friend (in this respect) not mother.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>नहि मम हरिराजसंश्रयात् क्षमतरमस्ति परत्र चेह वा। अभिमुखहतवीर सेवितं शयनमिदं मम सेवितुं क्षमम्॥<br />There is no other resource for me tending to my welfare both in this world and the next than taking refuge to this lord of monkeys. It is becoming for me to serve this bed which has been resorted to by the hero, slain (and lying before me.) monkeys, father is son's friend (in this respect) not mother.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>नहि मम हरिराजसंश्रयात् क्षमतरमस्ति परत्र चेह वा। अभिमुखहतवीर सेवितं शयनमिदं मम सेवितुं क्षमम्॥<br />There is no other resource for me tending to my welfare both in this world and the next than taking refuge to this lord of monkeys.
