<h3>Sundara Kanda: Chapter 8</h3><p id='1'>स तस्य मध्ये भवनस्य संस्थितो महद्विमानं मणिरत्नचित्रितम्। प्रतप्तजाम्बूनदजालकृत्रिम ददर्श धीमान् पवनात्मजः कपिः॥<br />Staying in that mansion, that intelligent monkey, the offspring of the Wind-god, beheld that splendid aerial car, beauteous with excellent jewels, and furnished with windows of burnished gold.</p>
<p id='2'>तदप्रमेयप्रतिकारकृत्रिमं कृतं स्वयं साध्विति विश्वकर्मणा। दिवं गते वायुपथे प्रतिष्ठितं व्यराजतादित्यपथस्य लक्ष्म तत्॥<br />And the car, embellished with transcendentally beautiful figures, belauded by Viśvakarmā himself as constituting the acme (of his art), which, mounting the welkin, looked like a mark of the Sun's orbit, appeared resplendent.</p>
<p id='3'>न तत्र किंचिन्न कृतं प्रयत्नतो न तत्र किंचिन्न महार्घरत्नवत्। न ते विशेषा नियताः सुरेष्वपि न तत्र किंचिन्न महाविशेषवत्॥<br />There was nothing in that car which was not made skilfully; nothing that did not look like a precious jewel (sprung spontaneously on its person), and the style displayed in its various parts surpassed anything that could be found in the car of the celestials themselves, and everything in that car was executed in the highest style of excellence,</p>
<p id='4'>तपः समाधानपराक्रमार्जितं मन:समाधानविचारचारिणम्। अनेकसंस्थानविशेषनिर्मितं ततस्ततस्तुल्यविशेषनिर्मितम्॥<br />That (car) obtained (by Ravana) in virtue of prowess sprung from asceticism and contemplation (of the Deity); capable of repairing wherever (the owner) wished to wend; displaying various kinds of constructive skill, composed of materials procured from diverse sources, such as were worthy of a celestial car.</p>
<p id='5'>मनः समाधाय तु शीघ्रगामिनं. दुरासदं मारुततुल्यगामिनम्। महात्मनां पुण्यकृतां महर्द्धिनां यशस्विनामग्र्यमुदामिवालयम्॥<br />Fleet-coursing in consonance with the wish of its master; incapable of being approached; * equal to the wind in celerity; the source of happiness to illustrious, high-souled, and pious ones—possessors of 'riches fineless' and high rapture; *By the impious. Another reading is duravaram—incapable of being withstood by the enemy. 'Vide Othello.</p>
<p id='6'>विशेषमालम्ब्य विशेषसंस्थितं विचित्रकूटं बहुकूटमण्डितम्। मनोऽभिरामं शरदिन्दुनिर्मलं विचित्रकूटं शिखरं गिरेर्यथा॥<br />Coursing through the firmament in a variety of ways, the congeries of all wonderful things, adorned with ranges of chambers; captivating to the mind; stainless as the autumnal Moon; furnished with splendid summits, like the crest of a mountain.</p>
<p id='7'>वहन्ति यत्कुण्डलशोभितानना महाशना व्योमचरा निशाचराः। विवृत्तविध्वस्तविशाललोचना महाजवा भूतगणाः सहस्रशः॥ वसन्तपुष्पोत्करचारुदर्शनं वसन्तमासादपि चारुदर्शनम्। स पुष्पकं तत्र विमानमुत्तमं ददर्श तद् वानरवीरसत्तमः॥<br />Which was borne by rangers of the night, given to mighty meals, ranging the sky, with faces graced with ear-rings; and by thousands of ghosts possessed of terrible speed, having expansive, winkless and rolling eyes. That heroic firs of monkeys saw that excellent car, beauteous with vernal blossoms, fairer than the month of spring and furnished with flowers.</p>
