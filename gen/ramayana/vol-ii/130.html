<h3>Kishkinda Kanda: Chapter 57</h3><p id='1'>शोकाद् भ्रष्टस्वरमपि श्रुत्वा वानरयूथपाः। श्रद्दधुनैव तद्वाक्यं कर्मणा तस्य शङ्किताः॥<br />Hearing his accents faltering through grief, the leaders of monkey-herds, alarmed by his action*, did not repose confidence in his speech. Karmaņā (instru.) by his action. The commentator explains: alarmed by his speech about eating up the monkeys. The passage is</p>
<p id='2'>ते प्रायमुपविष्टास्तु दृष्ट्वा गृधं प्लवङ्गमाः।। चक्रुर्बुद्धिं तदा रौद्रां सर्वान् नो भक्षयिष्यति ॥<br />Seated for the purpose of fasting to death, the monkeys, seeing the vulture, with terror thought within themselves, he shall eat us all up.</p>
<p id='3'>सर्वथा प्रायमासीनान् यदि नो भक्षयिष्यति। कृतकृत्या भविष्यामः क्षिप्रं सिद्धिमितो गताः॥<br />If he eat us up, who have sat down to fast to death, we shall secure success, and speedily attain our end.</p>
<p id='4'>एतां बुद्धिं ततश्चकुः सर्वे ते हरियूथपाः। अवतार्य गिरेः शृङ्गाद् गृध्रमाहाङ्गदस्तदा॥<br />Then those monkey-chiefs resolved thus. And descending from the summit of the mountain, Angada spoke to the vulture,</p>
<p id='5'>बभूवःरजो नाम वानरेन्द्रः प्रतापवान्। ममार्यः पार्थिवः पक्षिन् धार्मिकौ तस्य चात्मजौ॥ सुग्रीवश्चैव वाली च पुत्रौ घनबलाबुभौ। लोके विश्रुतकर्माभूद् राजा वाली पिता मम॥<br />There was a lord of monkeys named Riksaraja, endowed with prowess. That king, O bird, was my grandsire. He had two virtuous sons, exceedingly powerful both-Vāli and Sugriva. My father, Vali, was famed in the world for his deeds.</p>
<p id='6'>राजा कृत्स्नस्य जगत इक्ष्वाकूणां महारथः। रामो दाशरथिः श्रीमान् प्रविष्टो दण्डकावनम्॥ लक्ष्मणेन. सह भ्रात्रा वैदेह्या सह भार्यया। पितुर्निदेशनिरतो धर्मं पन्थानमाश्रितः॥<br />It came to pass that mighty monarch of all this earth, descendant of the Ikṣwākus, the great and graceful car warrior, Rāma, son to Dasaratha, intent upon the injunction of his sire, resorting to the path of righteousness, entered the woods of Dandaka in company with his brother, Lakşmaņa and his wife Vaidehī.</p>
<p id='7'>तस्य भार्या जनस्थानाद् रावणेन हृता बलात्। रामस्य तु पितुर्मित्रं जटायुर्नाम गृध्रराट्॥ ददर्श सीतां वैदेहीं ह्रियमाणां विहायसा। रावणं विरथं कृत्वा स्थापयित्वा च मैथिलीम्। परिश्रान्तश्च वृद्धश्च रावणेन हतो रणे॥<br />His spouse was forcibly carried away from Janasthāna. And the friend of Rāma's father, the king of vultures, named Jatayu, saw Videha's daughter, Sītā, as she was being carried away in the sky. And after having thrown down Rāvana from his car, and placed Maithili on the ground, (that vulture) old and overcome with fatigue was (at length) slain by Ravana in battle.</p>
<p id='8'>एवं गृध्रो हतस्तेन रावणेन बलीयसा। संस्कृतश्चापि रामेण जगाम गतिमुत्तमाम्॥<br />Thus slain by the powerful Rāvana, the vulture, having had his funereal obsequies performed by Rama. (himself), has attained excellent state.</p>
<p id='9'>ततो मम पितृव्येण सुग्रीवेण महात्मना। चकार राघवः सख्यं कोऽवधीत् पितरं मम ॥<br />Then Rāghava made friends with my uncle, the high-souled Sugrīva; and he also slew my sire.</p>
<p id='10'>मम पित्रा निरुद्धो हि सुग्रीवः सचिवैः सह। निहत्य वालिनं रामस्ततस्तमभिषेचयत्॥<br />My father had debarred Sugrīva from the kingdom along with his counsellors; but Rāma, having slain Vāli, installed him (Sugrīva).</p>
<p id='11'>स राज्ये स्थापितस्तेन सुग्रीवो वानरेश्वरः। राजा वानरमुख्यानां तेन प्रस्थापिता वयम्॥<br />And established in the monarchy by him (Rāma), Sugriva is (now) the master of the monkeys and king of all the foremost monkeys. By him have we been sent.</p>
<p id='12'>एवं रामप्रयुक्तास्तु मार्गमाणास्ततस्ततः। वैदेहीं नाधिगच्छामो रात्रौ सूर्यप्रभामिव॥<br />Despatched hither by Rāma, we have searched for Sītā all round, but Vaidehī we have not found, as one does not find the solar splendour at night.</p>
<p id='13'>ते वयं दण्डकारण्यं विचित्य सुसमाहिताः। अज्ञानात् तु प्रविष्टाः स्म धरण्या विवृतं बिलम्॥<br />It came to pass that, having heedfully explored the Dandaka forest, we through ignorance entered a cave lying open before.</p>
<p id='14'>मयस्य मायाविहितं तद् बिलं च विचिन्वताम्। व्यतीतस्तत्र नो मासो यो राज्ञा समयः कृतः॥<br />That cave, you must know, was constructed by the illusive energy of Maya. And there we spent a month the term which had been fixed by the monarch.</p>
<p id='15'>ते वयं कपिराजस्य सर्वे वचनकारिणः। कृतां संस्थामतिक्रान्ता भयात् प्रायमुपासिताः॥<br />Doing the behests of the king of monkeys, we, having overstayed the terms which had been appointed, have from fear sat here down for the purpose of fasting to death.</p>
<p id='16'>क्रुद्धे तस्मिंस्तु काकुत्स्थे सुग्रीवे च सलक्ष्मणे। गतानामपि सर्वेषां तत्र नो नास्ति जीवितम्॥<br />On that Kākutstha being wrought up with wrath, as well as Sugrīva together with Lakş maņa, we, repairing thither, shall lose our lives.</p>
