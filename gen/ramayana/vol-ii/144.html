<h3>Sundara Kanda: Chapter 4</h3><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>स निर्जित्य पुरीं लङ्कां श्रेष्ठां तां कामरूपिणीम्। विक्रमेण महातेजा हनूमान् कपिसत्तमः॥ अद्वारेण महावीर्यः प्राकारमवपुप्लुवे। निशि लङ्कां महासत्त्वो विवेश कपिकुञ्जरः॥<br />Having by his vigour vanquished the excellent City of Lankā capable of wearing forms at will, that exceedingly energetic foremost of monkeys, Hanumān, endued with prodigious prowess, Ieaped sheer over a wall, where doorway there was none; and that elephantine monkey gifted with great strength entered Lankā by night.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>प्रविश्य नगरी लङ्कां कपिराजहितंकरः। चक्रेऽथ पादं सव्यं च शत्रूणां स तु मूर्धनि ॥<br />Entering the city of Larkā that one (ever) compassing the welfare of the monkey-king, set his left foot on the heads of his foes. * *The literal meaning is that, leaping over the wall, Hanumān, first set his left foot on the hostile soil; and this act of his, as tending to the discomfiture of the foe, is looked upon by the author in the light of Hanumān setting his left foot on the heads of the Rāks asas. The setting of the left foot on an enemy's dominions, is considered by the scriptures as very inauspicious.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>प्रविष्टः सत्त्वसम्पन्नो निशायां मारुतात्मजः। स महापथमास्थाय मुक्तपुष्पविराजितम्॥<br />Entering in by night, the offspring of the Wind-god furnished with strength, proceeded along the high-way strewn with blossoms.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>ततस्तु तां पुरीं लङ्कां रम्यामभिययौ कपिः। हसितोत्कृष्टनिनदैस्तूर्यघोषपुरस्कृतैः॥ वज्राङ्कुशनिकाशैश्च वज्रजालविभूषतैः। गृहमेधैः पुरी रम्या बभासे द्यौरिवाम्बुदैः॥<br />The monkey held his way in the charming city of Lankā, resounding with grateful sounds mixed with laughter, and ringing with trumpet blasts. And with multitudes of mansions marked with the thunderbolt and the hook, and adorned with diamond windows, the charming metropolis looked splendid, like the welkin with clouds.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>प्रजज्वाल तदा लङ्का रक्षोगणगृहैः शुभैः। सिताभ्रसदृशैश्चित्रैः पद्मस्वस्तिकसंस्थितैः॥ वर्धमानगृहैश्चापि सर्वतः सुविभूषितैः।<br />Then Lankā, with handsome and variegated mansions of Rākṣasas, resembling white clouds and arranged like lotus-leaves; and adorned on all sides with structures superscribed 'Vardhamāna,' shone forth in all it glory.</p>
