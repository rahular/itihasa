<h3>Kishkinda Kanda: Chapter 60</h3><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>ततः कृतोदकं स्नातं तं गृधं हरियूथपाः। उपविष्टा गिरौ रम्ये परिवार्य समन्ततः॥<br />When the vulture had offered oblations of water to the manes of his deceased brother and finished his ablutions, the monkey-chiefs sat down in that charming mountain, surrounding him.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>तमङ्गदमुपासीनं तैः सर्वैर्हरिभिर्वृतम्। जनितप्रत्ययो हर्षात् सम्पातिः पुनरब्रवीत्॥<br />And inspired with confidence in the words of the Nisakara), Sampati, from delight, said to Angada, who was seated, surrounded by all the monkeys.'</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>कृत्वा. निःशब्दमेकाग्राः शृण्वन्तु हरयो मम। तथ्यं संकीर्तयिष्यामि यथा जानामि मैथिलीम्॥<br />Remaining silent, do you, you monkeys, heedfully hear what I say. I will tell you truly how I came to know Maithili.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>अस्य विन्ध्यस्य शिखरे पतितोऽस्मि पुरानघ। सूर्यतापपरीताङ्गो निर्दग्धः सूर्यरश्मिभिः॥<br />My body being affected by solar heat, and my wings burnt by the rays of the sun, O sinless one, I formerly fell to this summit of Vindhya.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>लब्धसंज्ञस्तु षड्रावाद् विवशो विह्वलनिव। वीक्षमाणो दिशः सर्वा नाभिजानामि किंचन॥<br />On regaining my senses after six nights, during which I was insensible, I looked around in bewilderment, but could not recognise anything whatever.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>ततस्तु सागराशैलान् नदीः सर्वाः सरांसि च। वनानि च प्रदेशांश्च निरीक्ष्य मतिरागता॥<br />Then closely viewing oceans and mountains, rivers and tanks, and woods and countries, my thoughts came back to me.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>हृष्टपक्षिगणाकीर्णः कन्दरोदरकूटवान्। दक्षिणस्योदधेस्तीरे विन्ध्योऽयमिति निश्चितः॥<br />Seeing this place abounding in cheerful birds, containing woods and crested with summits, I for certain concluded it to be Vindhya on the shores of the Southern sea.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>आसीच्चात्राश्रमं पुण्यं सुरैरपि सुपूजितम्। ऋषिर्निशाकरो नाम यस्मिन्नुग्रतपाऽभवत्॥<br />And here lay a sacred asylum, honoured even by the celestials, and here dwelt a saint named Niśākara, of fierce austerities.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>अष्टौ वर्षसहस्राणि तेनास्मिन्नृषिणा गिरौ। वसतो मम धर्मज्ञे स्वर्गते तु निशाकरे॥<br />After Niśākara cognizant of virtue had gone to heaven, I bereft of that saint, passed eight thousand years in this mountain.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>अवतीर्य च विन्ध्याग्रात् कृच्छ्रेण विषमाच्छनैः। तीक्ष्णदर्भा वसुमती दुःखेन पुनरागतः॥<br />Descending with difficulty from the uneven top of Vindhya, I again came* to the earth covered with sharp-pointed grass. *While the saint was staying here.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>तमृषिं द्रष्टुकामोऽस्मि दुःखेनाभ्यागतो भृशम्। जटायुषा मया चैव बहुशोऽधिगतो हि सः॥<br />I was eager to see the saint; and (therefore), with much ado I came to him; and Jatāyu and myself saw that saint many a time and oft.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>तस्याश्रमपदाभ्याशे ववुर्वाताः सुगन्धिनः। वृक्षो नापुष्पितः कश्चिदफलो वा न दृश्यते॥<br />A fragrant breeze blew about the hermitage; and no tree was found that did not bear flowers and fruits.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>उपेत्य चाश्रमं पुण्यं वृक्षमूलमुपाश्रितः। द्रष्टकामः प्रतीक्षे च भगवन्तं निशाकरम्॥<br />Approaching the holy asylum, I, desirous of beholding the worshipful Niśākara, waited at the foot of a tree.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>अथ पश्यामि दूरस्थमृषि ज्वलिततेजसम्। कृताभिषेकं दुर्धर्षमुपावृत्तमुदङ्मुखम्॥<br />Then at a distance I saw the saint, flaming in energy and irrepressible,-returning northwards.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>तमृक्षाः सृमराव्याघ्राः सिंहा नानासरीसृपाः। परिवार्योपगच्छन्ति दातारं प्राणिनो यथा॥<br />As creatures gather round a giver, bears and Srimaras, tigers lions, and various reptiles, were going along, surrounding him.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>ततः प्राप्तमृषि ज्ञात्वा तानि सत्त्वानि वै ययुः। प्रविष्टे राजनि यथा सर्वं सामात्यकं बलम्॥<br />And knowing that the saint had arrived (at his home), the animals went away, as go away forces together with counsellors, when the sovereign has entered (his palace).</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>ऋषिस्तु दृष्ट्वा मां तुष्टः प्रविष्टश्चाश्रमं पुनः। मुहूर्तमात्रानिर्गम्य ततः कार्यमपृच्छत॥<br />The saint was glad on seeing me. Then reentering his asylum for a short space, he came out and enquired for my mission.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>सौम्य वैकल्यतां दृष्ट्वा रोम्णां ते नावगम्यते। अग्निदग्धाविमौ पक्षौ प्राणाश्चापि शरीरके॥<br />O mild one, in consequence of your feathers having undergone alteration, I cannot recognise you. Your two wings have been blasted by fire; and your powers in your frail frame are in the same condition).</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>गृध्रौ द्वौ दृष्टपूर्वी मे मातरिश्वसमौ जवे। गृध्राणां चैव राजानौ भ्रातरौ कामरूपिणौ॥<br />After time I saw two vultures like to wind in speed,-kings of vultures, brothers, wearing shapes at will.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>ज्येष्ठोऽवितस्त्वं सम्पाते जटायुरनुजस्तव। मानुषं रूपमास्थाय गृह्णीतां चरणौ मम॥<br />You are I know, elder, O Sampati; and Jatayu is younger to you. Assuming human forms, you had taken hold of my feet.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>किं ते व्याधिसमुत्थानं पक्षयोः पतनं कथम्। दण्डो वायं धृतः केन सर्वमाख्याहि पृच्छतः॥<br />Now, what ailment has attacked you? And why have your plumes fallen off? And who has dealt this punishment to you? Do you tell all this to me, who am asking you.</p>
