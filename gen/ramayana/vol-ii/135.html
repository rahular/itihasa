<h3>Kishkinda Kanda: Chapter 62</h3><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>एवमुक्त्वा मुनिश्रेष्ठमरुतं भृशदुःखितः। अथ ध्यात्वा मुहूर्तं च भगवानिदमब्रवीत्॥<br />Having said this to that foremost of ascetics, I smitten with grief, began to weep. Thereat, after, reflecting for a while, that reverend one said,</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>पक्षौ च ते प्रपक्षौ च पुनरन्यौ भविष्यतः। चक्षुषी चैव प्राणाश्च विक्रमश्च बलं च ते॥<br />Your wings together with two smaller ones shall grow again; as also your sight, energy, prowess and strength.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>पुराणे सुमहत्कार्यं भविष्यं हि मया श्रुतम्। दृष्टं मे तपसा चैव श्रुत्वा च विदितं मम ॥<br />Having heard of it, and also seen it through ascetic power, I know that a great deed is going to take place.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>राजा दशरथो नाम कश्चिदिक्ष्वाकुवर्धनः। तस्य पुत्रो महातेजा रामो नाम भविष्यति ॥<br />There shall be a king named Daſaratha, increaser of the Ikşwāku race. He shall have a son, named Rāma, endowed with exceeding energy.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>अरण्यं च सह भ्रात्रा लक्ष्मणेन गमिष्यति। तस्मिन्नर्थे नियुक्तः सन् पित्रा सत्यपराक्रमः॥<br />He (Rāma) shall repair to the forest in company with his brother, Laksmana; that one having truth for prowess, having commissioned to that effect by his sire.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>नैर्ऋतो रावणो नाम तस्य भार्या हरिष्यति। राक्षसेन्द्रो जनस्थाने अवध्यः सुरदानवैः॥<br />A friend named Rāvana, the lord of Rākşasas, incapable of being slain by either the gods or the Dāvanas, shall carry off his Rāma's) spouse in Janasthāna.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>सा च कामैः प्रलोभ्यन्ती भक्ष्यैर्भोज्यैश्च मैथिली। न भोक्ष्यति महाभागा दुःखमग्ना यशस्विनी॥<br />And albeit tempted by viands and objects of enjoyment and desire, the famous and highly virtuous one, plunged in grief, shall not pertake of those things.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>परमान्नं च वैदेह्या ज्ञात्वा दास्यति वासवः। यदन्नममृतप्रख्यं सुराणामपि दुर्लभम्।।८<br />And knowing that Videha's daughter (has been fasting for many a day), Vāsava shall offer Vaidehī pāyasa like to ambrosia, difficult of being procured even by the gods.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>तदन्नं मैथिली प्राप्य विज्ञायेन्द्रादिदं त्विति। अग्रमुद्धृत्य रामाय भूतले निर्वपिष्यति॥<br />Receiving that food, Maithili, knowing that it has come from Indra,* took up a little of it from the surface, and dropped it to the earth for Rāma. *From the fact of the food not touching the earth, and other signs. It is humorous to read the explanation of the commentator as to the reason of Indra's supplying Sītā with food. If Sītā remained fasting, Rāvana would forego his attachment for Vaidehi, on seeing her altered appearance; and thus his destruction could not take place. Further, if he saw Sītā retaining her former loveliness, he could conclude that Sītā, as also Rāma, were superhuman character, and that as such they could not be agents for his destruction according to the prophecy Rāvana shall be slain by a human being. This inducing him to persist in his bellicose attitude towards Rāma, would being down ruin upon his head.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>यदि जीवति मे भर्ता लक्ष्मणो वापि देवरः। देवत्वं गच्छतोर्वापि तयोरन्नमिदं त्विति ॥<br />Whether my husband as well as his younger brother live, or they have attained godhead, let this food serve for them.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>एष्यन्ति प्रेषितास्तत्र रामदूताः प्लवङ्गमाः। आख्येया राममहिषी त्वया तेभ्यो विहङ्गम॥<br />Rāma's envoys, having been despatched thither.* shall come hither. You should relate to them all the facts connected with the queen of Rāma. *For going to Lankā.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>सर्वथा तु न गन्तव्यमीदृशः क्व गमिष्यसि। देशकालौ प्रतीक्षस्व पक्षौ त्वं प्रतिपत्स्यसे॥<br />Do not by any means go hence; and in this case, whither, again, wilt you repair? Do you stay here for season and place. You shall regain your wings.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>उत्सहेयमहं कर्तुमद्यैव त्वां सपक्षकम्। इहस्थस्त्वं हि लोकानां हितं कार्यं करिष्यसि॥<br />I could this very day furnish you with wings. But, by staying here in this condition, you wilt be able to compass the welfare of the worlds.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>त्वयापि खलु तत् कार्यं तयोश्च नृपपुत्रयोः। ब्राह्मणानां गुरूणां च मुनीनां वासवस्य च॥<br />Even you shall do that act in behalf of those sons of the king, of the Brāhmanas, of the spiritual preceptors, of the ascetics, and of Vasava.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>इच्छाम्यहमपि द्रष्टुं भ्रातरौ रामलक्ष्मणौ। नेच्छे चिरं धारयितुं प्राणांस्त्यक्ष्ये कलेवरम्। महर्षिस्त्वब्रवीदेवं दृष्टतत्त्वार्थदर्शनः॥<br />I also am desirous of beholding the brothers, Rāma and Laksmana. I do not wish to hold this life long. I would renounce my life.' That Maharși, conversant with the nature of things, told me this.'</p>
