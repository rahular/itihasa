<h3>Sundara Kanda: Chapter 29</h3><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>तथागतां तां व्यथितामनिन्दितां व्यतीतहर्षां परिदीनमानसाम्। शुभां निमित्तानि शुभानि भेजिरे नरं श्रिया जुष्टमिवोपसेविनः॥<br />Like to servants waiting upon a wealthy person various auspicious omens waited upon Sītā of a blameless and comely person, racked with grief and divested of joy.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>राज्यावृतं कृष्णविशालशुक्लम्। प्रास्पन्दतैकं नयनं सुकेश्या मीनाहतं पद्ममिवाभिताम्रम्॥<br />And the large left eye of that dame having graceful hairs, having dark pupils, white ends and thick eye-lashes, began to dance like a lotus shaken by a fish.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>भुजश्च चार्वञ्चितवृत्तपीनः परायंकालागुरुचन्दनाहः। अनुत्तमेनाध्युषितः प्रियेण चिरेण वामः समवेपताशु॥<br />And her beautiful, round, plump left hand, which, ere this, sprinkled with costly aguru and sandal, used to serve for a pillow to Rāma, began to dance now again and again after a long time.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>स्तयोर्द्वयोः संहतयोस्तु जातः। प्रस्पन्दमानः पुनरूरुरस्या रामं पुरस्तात् स्थितमाचचक्षे॥<br />And her well built plump left thigh, resembling the trunk of an elephant, dancing, announced that she would soon behold Rāma.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>मीषद्रजोध्वस्तमिवातुलाक्ष्याः। वासः स्थितायाः शिखराग्रदन्त्याःकिंचित् परिस्त्रंसतचारुगात्र्याः॥<br />And the gold-hued cloth, now covered with dust, of that damsel of a comely person, having teeth like pomegranate seeds, slipped a little off its place.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>एतैर्निमित्तैरपरैश्च सुभ्रूः संचोदिता प्रागपि साधुसिद्धैः। वातातपक्लान्तमिव प्रणष्टं वर्षेण बीजं प्रतिसंजहर्ष॥<br />And being enlivened by those and various other auspicious omens, she attained joy like to a seed, spoiled by the wind and the sun, growing afresh in the rainy season.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>तस्याः पुनर्बिम्बफलोपमोष्ठं स्वक्षिभुकेशान्तमरालपक्ष्म। वक्त्रं बभासे सितशुक्लदंष्ट्र राहोर्मुखाच्चन्द्र इव प्रमुक्तः॥<br />And her countenance, having lips red as Bimba fruits, beautiful eyes, eye-brows extending to ears, curling eye-lashes and white teeth, again appeared graceful like to the Moon released from the full grasp of Rahu. (Like the Moon when full eclipse is just over-In mythology Rāhu is the son of Sinika, a Daitya, with the tail of a dragon whose head was severed from-his body by Vişnu, but being immortal this head and tail retained their separate existence and being transferred to the stellar sphere, became the authors of eclipses.)</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>सा वीतशोका व्यपनीततन्द्रा शान्तज्वरा हर्षविबुद्धसत्त्वा। अशोभतार्या वदनेन शुक्ले शीतांशुना रात्रिरिवोदितेन ॥<br />Her grief and exhaustion were removed. sorrow was pacified and her heart was filled with joy. And she with her countenance appeared beautiful like a lunar night beautified by the rays of the Moon.</p>
