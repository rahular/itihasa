<h3>Aranya Kanda: Chapter 3</h3><p id='1'>अथोवाच पुनर्वाक्यं विराधः पूरयन् वनम्। पृच्छतो मम हि ब्रूतं कौ युवां क्व गमिष्यथः॥<br />Then Virādha again spoke filling the forest, Do you tell me who ask you, who are you and whither are you going? The North-West Provinces text has additional Sloka : Having said this, the graceful Lakşmaņa spoke to Virādha as if jestingly, Who are you that coming to the forest, are ranging it pleasantly?-</p>
<p id='2'>तमुवाच ततो रामो राक्षसं ज्वलिताननम्। पृच्छन्तं सुमहातेजा इक्ष्वाकुकुलमात्मनः॥ क्षत्रियौ वृत्तसम्पन्नौ विद्धि नौ वनगोचरौ। त्वां तु वेदितुमिच्छावः कस्त्वं चरसि दण्डकान्॥<br />Thereupon, the highly energetic Rāma answered the Rākşasa with a flaming face, when he had thus asked (Rāma) that he belonged to the Iksvaku race. Know us that are in the forest, for Kșatriyas of respectable character. I also am anxious of knowing who you are, wandering in the Dandakas.</p>
<p id='3'>तमुवाच विराधस्तु रामं सत्यपराक्रमम्। हन्त वक्ष्यामि ते राजन् निबोध मम राघव॥<br />Virădha answered Råma having truth for his prowess, Ah! I will tell you, O king. Do you,O Răghava understand!</p>
<p id='4'>पुत्रः किल जवस्याहं माता मम शतहदा। विराध इति मामाहुः पृथिव्यां सर्वराक्षसाः॥<br />I am son of Java, and my mother is Satahradā. All the Rāksasas of the earth have called me Virādha.</p>
<p id='5'>तपसा चाभिसंप्राप्ता ब्रह्मणो हि प्रसादजा। शस्त्रेणावध्यता लोकेऽच्छेद्याभेद्यत्वमेव च ॥<br />Having gratified Brahmă by my asceticism, IⓇreceived (this boon) that none in the world would be able to slay me by mangling my body with weapons.</p>
<p id='6'>उत्सृज्य प्रमदामेनामनपेक्षौ यथागतम्। त्वरमाणौ पलायेथां न वां जीवितमाददे॥ तं रामः प्रत्युवाचेदं कोपसंरक्तलोचनः। राक्षसं विकृताकारं विराधं पापचेतसम्<br />Forsaking this fair one, do you, renouncing all hope (of either recovering her or vanquishing me), speedily flee away to that place whence you had come; else I shall deprive you of your lives. Thereat, Rāma with his eyes reddened through wrath replied to that Rākşasa of a deformed shape, the wicked Viradha.</p>
<p id='7'>क्षुद्र धिक् त्वां तु हीनार्थं मृत्युमन्वेषसे ध्रुवम्। रणे प्राप्स्यसि संतिष्ठ न मे जीवन् विमोक्ष्यसे॥<br />Little! shame on you of base purposes! You surely seek your own death; and (death) you shall get in battle. Stay! You escapist me not with life.</p>
<p id='8'>ततः सज्यं धनुः कृत्वा रामः सुनिशिताशरान्। सुशीघ्रमभिसंधाय राक्षसं निजघान ह॥ धनुषा ज्यागुणवता सप्त बाणान् मुमोच ह। रुक्मपुङ्खान् महावेगान् सुपर्णानिलतुल्यगान्॥<br />Then stringing his bow, Rāma, speedily aiming at the Rākşasa, pierced him with sharpened shafts; and (then) from his bow-string let go seven shafts, having their feathered parts plaited with good, furnished with great velocity, and coursing like Suparna or the wind.</p>
<p id='9'>ते शरीरं विराधस्य भित्त्वा बर्हिणवाससः। निपेतुः शोणितादिग्धा धरण्यां पावकोपमाः॥<br />Thereat, resembling flames, those arrows furnished with peacocks, feathers, pierced. Viradha's body, and fell to the earth, covered with blood.</p>
<p id='10'>स विद्धो न्यस्य वैदेहीं शूलमुद्यम्य राक्षसः। अभ्यद्रवत् सुसंक्रुद्धस्तदा रामं सलक्ष्मणम्॥<br />On being thus pierced, the Rākṣasa set Vaidehi down, and, upraising a dart, rushed in wrath towards Rāma and Lakşmaņa.</p>
<p id='11'>स विनद्य महानादं शूलं शक्रध्वजोपमम्। प्रगृह्याशोभत तदा व्यात्तानन इवान्तकः॥<br />And sending forth a mighty roar, he took up a dart resembling the banner of Sakra and he then appeared like the Destroyer* with opening mouth.</p>
<p id='12'>अथ तौ भ्रातरौ दीप्तं शरवर्षं ववर्षतुः। विराधे राक्षसे तस्मिन् कालान्तकयमोपमे॥<br />Then the brothers showered a blazing volley of shafts on that Rākşasa, resembling the Destroyer himself. The text has Kalāntakayamopame-abl..~~ resembling Kala, Antaka, or Yama. The commentator cites a sloka, which assigns three several functions to the three, Kāla execute his office on the occasion of the separation of life from the body; Antaka compasses the end; and Yama finally sits in judgement upon the departed soul. But this strikes me as misplaced erudition. I, however, give the commonsense rendering,</p>
<p id='13'>स प्रहस्य महारौद्रः स्थित्वाजृम्भत राक्षसः। जृम्भमाणस्य ते वाणाः कायान्निष्पेतुराशुगाः॥<br />Stationing himself at a spot, the Rākşasa, laughing terribly, yawned, and as he yawned the flest-coursing shafts fell off from his person, a</p>
<p id='14'>स्पर्शात्तु वरदानेन प्राणान् संरोध्य राक्षसः। विराधः शूलमुद्यम्य राघवावभ्यधावत॥<br />And by virtue of the bestowal of the boon (by Brahmā), the Rākşasa Virādha drew up his vital energies, and, lifting up a pike, darted at the descendants of Raghu.</p>
<p id='15'>तच्छूलं वज्रसंकाशं गगने ज्वलनोपमम्। द्वाभ्यां शराभ्यां चिच्छेद रामः शस्त्रभृतां वरः॥<br />That best of those bearing arms cut off with two arrows that dart resembling the thunder-bolt and flaming in the sky.</p>
<p id='16'>तद् रामविशिखैश्छिन्नं शूलं तस्यापतद् भुवि। पपाताशनिना छिन्नं मेरोरिव शिलातलम्॥<br />And the dart severed by the shafts of Rāma, fell to the earth, as falls a crag severed by the thunderbolt.</p>
<p id='17'>तौ खङ्गौ क्षिप्रमुद्यम्य कृष्णसर्पाविवोद्यतौ। तूर्णमापेततुस्तस्य तदा प्रहरतां बलात्॥<br />Thereat, swiftly raising up sword, resembling a black snake, each (of the Rāghavas) approached his antagonist, and began to assail him hastily.</p>
<p id='18'>स वध्यमानः सुभृशं भुजाभ्यां परिगृह्य तौ। अप्रकम्प्यौ नरव्याघ्रौ रौद्रः प्रस्थातुमैच्छत ॥<br />Thus hard beset, that terrible one, seizing them both with his arms, attempted to make away with those foremost of men, who, however, retained their calmness.</p>
<p id='19'>तस्याभिप्रायमाज्ञाय रामो लक्ष्मणब्रवीत्। वहत्वयमलं तावत् पथानेन तु राक्षसः॥ यथा चेच्छति सौमित्रे तथा वहतु राक्षसः। अयमेव हि नः पन्था येन याति निशाचरः॥<br />Reading his purpose, Rāma spoke to Lakşmana, Let the Rākşasa bear us by this way. Not use of letting him. O Sumitra's son let the Rākşasa bear us wherever he likes. Even this, by which the ranger of the night is proceeding, is our way.</p>
<p id='20'>स तु स्वबलवीर्येण समुत्क्षिप्य निशाचरः। बालाविव स्कन्धगतौ चकारातिर्बलोद्धतः॥<br />And lifting up (Rāma and Lakşmana) by his might and. prowess, as if they were striplings, that haughty ranger of the night laid them on his shoulders.</p>
<p id='21'>तावारोप्य ततः स्कन्धं राघवौ रजनीचरः। विराधो विनदन् घोरं जगामाभिमुखो वनम्॥<br />And having deposited the Rāghavas on his shoulders, Virādha-ranger* of night-sending up dreadful shouts, directed his course towards the forest. Another reading is:-That ranger of the night laid on his shoulders, those ones, who were puffed up with their exceeding prowess.</p>
<p id='22'>वनं महामेघनिभं प्रविष्टो द्रुमैर्महाद्भिर्विविधैरुपेतम्। नानाविधैः पक्षिकुलैर्विचित्रं शिवायुतं व्यालमृगैर्विकीर्णम्॥<br />And he at length entered the forest resembling a mighty mass of clouds, furnished with various kinds of trees, picturesque with diverse species of birds, and abounding in jackals, serpents and beasts.</p>
