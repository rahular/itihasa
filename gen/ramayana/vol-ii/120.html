<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>विचिताः पर्वताः सर्वे वनानि गहनानि च। निम्नगाः सागरान्ताश्च सर्वे जनपदाश्च ये॥ गुहाश्च विचिता सर्वे याश्च ते परिकीर्तिताः। विचिताश्च महागुल्मा लताविततसंतताः॥ गहनेषु च देशेषु दुर्गेषु विषमेषु च। सत्वान्यतिप्रमाणानि विचितानि हतानि च। ये चैव गहना देशा विचितास्ते पुनः पुनः॥<br />Searched have been all the mountains, and deep woods, and streams, and islands embosomed in the ocean, and the various provinces.
