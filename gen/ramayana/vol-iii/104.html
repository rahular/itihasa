<h3>Yuddha Kanda: Chapter 104</h3><p id='1'>स तु मोहात्सुसंक्रुद्धं कृतान्तबलचोदितः। क्रोधसंरक्तनयनो रावणः सूतमब्रवीत्॥<br />After gradually regaining his senses, Rāvana, urged on by the force of the Finisher, getting into a furious passion, with his eyes reddened in wrath, addressed the charioteer, saying.</p>
<p id='2'>हीनवीर्यमिवाशक्तं पौरुषेण विवर्जितम्। भीरं लघुमिवासत्त्वं विहीनमिव तेजसा॥ विमुक्तमिव मायाबिरलैरिव बहिष्कृतम्। मामवज्ञाय दुर्बुद्धे स्वया बुद्ध्या विचेष्टसे॥<br />perverse sense, disregarding me as devoid of prowess, and incompetent, and bereft of vigour-as cowardly, light, nerveless and shorn of energy, and as divorced by the power of illusion and debarred by arms, you act on your own understanding.</p>
<p id='3'>किमर्थं मामवज्ञाय मच्छन्दमनवेक्ष्य च। त्वया शत्रुसमक्षं मे रथोऽयमपवाहितः॥<br />Wherefore disregarding me, and not minding O you of my purpose, have you taken away my car from before the presence of the enemy?</p>
<p id='4'>त्वयाद्य हि ममानार्य चिरकालमुपार्जितम्। यशो वीर्यं च तेजश्च प्रत्ययश्च विनाशितः॥<br />O abject one! by you have my long earned renown and energy and prowess and credit been brought to naught.</p>
<p id='5'>शत्रोः प्रख्यातवीर्यस्य रञ्जनीयस्य विक्रमैः। पश्यतो युद्धलुब्धोऽहं कृतः कापुरुषस्त्वया।६।।<br />In the very sight of an enemy of renowned prowess, and one capable of being gratified with valorous deeds, have you made me, burning for battle, look as if I were a coward.</p>
<p id='6'>यत्त्वं कथमिदं मोहान्न चेद्वहसि दुर्मते। सत्योऽयं प्रतितों मे परेण त्वमुपस्कृतः॥<br />As, O wicked minded one, you did not even through heedlessness, take the car to the field of batile, I infer for certain that you have been bribed by the foe.</p>
<p id='7'>नहि तद्विद्यते कर्म सुहृदो हितकामिणः। रिपूणां सदृशं त्वेतद्यत्त्वयैतदनुष्ठितम्॥<br />The act that you have done, does not appear as that of a friend seeking our welfare; but today you have acted like an enemy.</p>
<p id='8'>निवर्तय रथं शीघ्रं यावत्रापैति मे रिपुः। यदि वाध्युषितोऽसि त्वं स्मर्यते यदि मे गुणः॥<br />If you have been maintained by me, if you remember my merit, do you swiftly turn the car before my enemy has departed.</p>
<p id='9'>एवं परुषमुक्तस्तु हितबुद्धिरबुद्धिना। अब्रवीद्रावणं सूतो हितं सानुनयं वचः॥<br />Thus admonished by him of slender sense, the charioteer possessed of intelligence, humbly spoke to Råvaņa words fraught with good.</p>
<p id='10'>न भीतोऽस्मि न मूढोऽस्मि नोपजप्तोऽस्मि शत्रुभिः न प्रमत्तो न निःस्नेहो विस्मृता न च सत्क्रिया॥<br />I am not afraid, nor stupefied, nor have I been bribed by the foe, nor am I negligent. And I have not forgotten your affection or your good offices.</p>
<p id='11'>मया तु हितकामेन यशश्च परिरक्षता। स्नेहप्रसन्नमनसा हितमित्यप्रियं कृतम्॥<br />And studious of your welfare, I have saved your fame; and with a mind overflowing with affection I have done (to you) this unpalatable good.</p>
<p id='12'>नास्मिनर्थे महाराज त्वं मां प्रियहिते रतम्। कश्चिल्लघुरिवानार्यो दोषतो गन्तुमर्हसि ॥<br />O mighty monarch, for this, you should not, like a frivolous and base one, criminate me that am ever engaged in what is good and dear to you.</p>
<p id='13'>श्रूयतां प्रति दास्यामि यन्निमित्तं मया रथः। नदीवेग इवाम्भोभिः संयुगे विनिवर्तितः॥<br />Listen! I shall render you reason why I turned away from the field the car, rushing like a river when the sea is swelled up* *On the ascension of the Moon.</p>
<p id='14'>श्रमं तवावगच्छामि महता रणकर्मणा। नहि ते वीर्यसौमुख्यं प्रकर्ष नोपधारये॥<br />I knew that you had been fatigued in consequence of your mighty exertions in the fight. And I could not perceive that your prowess then stood superior (to that of the foe).* *Two negatives in this verse amounting to an affirmative. This is the only instance of double negatives in Valmiki.</p>
<p id='15'>रथोद्वहनखिन्नाश्च भग्ना मे रथवाजिनः। दीना धर्मपरिश्रान्ता गावो वर्षहता इव ॥<br />The steeds of my car were worn out by-carrying it; and they were battered, and helpless and perspired like kine in a shower.</p>
<p id='16'>निमित्तानि च भूयिष्ठं यानि प्रादुर्भवन्ति नः। तेषु तेष्वभिपनेषु लक्षयाम्यप्रदक्षिणम्॥<br />And bad omens fast sprang up before us. And on these occurring, I perceived that things would go against us.</p>
<p id='17'>देशकालौ च विज्ञेयौ लक्षणानीङ्गितानि च। दैन्यं हर्षश्च खेदश्च रथिनश्च महाबल॥<br />O you endowed with exceeding might, a charioteer should be conversant with season and place, with omens, and the expressions of emotions; as also with depression of spirits, exhilaration, and grief.</p>
<p id='18'>स्थलनिम्नानि भूमेश्च समानि विषमाणि च। युद्धकालश्च विज्ञेयः परस्यान्तरदर्शनम् ॥<br />And he should have a knowledge of low, lever and uneven grounds, and the time for conflict, and he should be able to perceive the shortcomings of the enemy.</p>
<p id='19'>उपयानापयाने च स्थानं प्रत्यपसर्पणम्। सर्वमेतद्रथस्थेन ज्ञेयं रथकुटुम्बिना॥<br />And a charioteer mounted on a car, should know when to draw near an enemy, when to turn away from him when to stay; and when to turn round from before the foe-all these (he should know).</p>
<p id='20'>तव विश्रामहेतोस्तु तथैषां रथवाजिनाम्। रौद्रं वर्जयता खेदं क्षमं कृतमिदं मया॥<br />What I, for bringing respite to you as well as the horses of the car, have done by way of removing the terrific exhaustion, is proper.</p>
<p id='21'>स्वेच्छया न मया वीर रथोऽयमपवाहितः। भर्तुः स्नेहपरीतेन मयेदं यत्कृतं प्रभो॥<br />I did not, O hero, turn away the car of my own sheer will. What I have done, O lord, had been dictated by my affection for you.</p>
<p id='22'>आज्ञापय यथातत्त्वं वक्ष्यस्यरिनिषूदन। तत्करिष्याम्यहं वीर गतानृण्येन चेतसा ॥<br />Command me. What you say, O destroyer of foes. I will do every way, O hero with my whole soul.</p>
<p id='23'>संतुष्टस्तेन वाक्येन रावणस्तस्य सारथेः। प्रशस्यैनं बहुविधं युद्धलुब्धोऽब्रवीदिदम्॥<br />Thereat, well pleased with the speech of the charioteer, Ravana, eager for encounter, after praising him in various ways said.</p>
<p id='24'>रथं शीघ्रमिमं सूत राघवाभिमुखं नय। नाहत्वा समरे शत्रूनिवर्तिष्यति रावणः॥<br />O charioteer, do you swiftly take the car towards Rāghava. Without slaying his foe in fight, Ravana turn not away (from the field).</p>
<p id='25'>एवमुक्त्वा रथस्थस्य रावणो राक्षसेश्वरः। ददौ तस्य शुभं ह्येकं हस्ताभरणमुत्तमम्।। श्रुत्वा रावणवाक्यानि सारथिः सन्यवर्तत।२६।।<br />Speaking thus Råvaņa-lord of Rākşasas-gave the charioteer on the car an excellent ornament for the hand. Hearing Ravana's words, the charioteer drove the car.</p>
<p id='26'>ततो द्रुतं रावणवाक्यचोदितः प्रचोदयामास हयान्स सारथिः। स राक्षसेन्द्रस्य ततो महारथः क्षणेन रामस्य रणाग्रतोऽभवत्॥<br />And urged on by the speech of Rāvana, the charioteer drove on the steeds, and in a moment the mighty chariot of the Rākşasa-chief appeared before Rāma in the field of battle.</p>
