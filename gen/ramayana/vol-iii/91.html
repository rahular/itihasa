<p id='2'>ततः स जाम्बवन्तं च हनूमन्तं च वीर्यवान्। संनिपत्य महातेजास्तांश्च सर्वान्वनौकसः॥ आजगाम ततः शीघ्रं यत्र सुग्रीवराघवौ। विभीषणमवष्टभ्य हनूमन्तं च लक्ष्मणः॥<br />Then supporting himself on Vibhīşana and Hanuman, the exceedingly powerful Lakşmaņa endowed with prowess, taking Jambavan, Hanuman and all the monkeys with him, speedily went to the place where Sugrīva and Raghava were.</p>
<p id='3'>ततो राममभिक्रम्य सौमित्रिरभिवाद्य च। तस्थौ भ्रातृसमीपस्थः शक्रस्येन्द्रानुजो यथा।४॥<br />Then going round Rāma and saluted him, Sumitra's son stood before his brother, like Indra's brother staying before Sakra.</p>
<p id='4'>निष्टनत्रिव चागत्य राघवाय महात्मने। आचचक्षे तदा वीरो घोरमिन्द्रजितो वधम्॥<br />And approaching with a look which of itself was significant,* the heroic Vibhīşaņa described to the high-souled Räghava the dreadful destruction of Indrajit. *i.e. of the destruction of Indrajit.</p>
<p id='5'>रावणेस्तु शिरश्छिनं लक्ष्मणेन महात्मना। न्यवेदयत रामाय तदा हृष्टो विभीषणः॥<br />Then the delighted Vibhişaņa related to Rāma how the high-souled Lakşmaņa had cut off the head of Ravana's son.</p>
<p id='6'>श्रुत्वैव तु महावीर्यो लक्ष्मणेनेन्द्रजिद्वधम्। प्रहर्षमतुल लेभे वाक्यं चेदमुवाच ह॥<br />As soon as that exceedingly powerful one heard of the destruction of Indrajit by Lakşmana, he experienced a huge accession of joy, and thus delivered himself.</p>
<p id='7'>साधु लक्ष्मण तुष्टोऽस्मि कर्म चासुकरं कृतम्। रावणेहि विनाशेन जितमित्युपधारय।।।।<br />Excellent, O Laksmana! Pleased am I (with you). You have performed a difficult feat. The son of Rävana having been slain, know for certain that we have been victorious.</p>
<p id='8'>स तं शिरस्युपाघ्राय लक्ष्मणं कीर्तिवर्धनम्। लज्जमानं बलात्स्नेहादङ्कमारोप्य वीर्यवान्॥ उपवेश्य तमुत्सङ्गे परिष्वज्यावपीडितम्। धातर लक्ष्मण स्निग्धं पुनः पुनरुदैक्षत॥<br />Then smelling the head of the bashful Laks miana, enhancer of fame, (Rāma) endowed with prowess, from affection forcibly hugged him into his lap. And making him seat on his lap, and overpowering him with embraces,* (Rama) again and again tenderly eyed his brother, Lakş imana. * Aapiritam-fac) pained. Rāmānaya says this epithet refers to Laksmana's having been wounded in the encounter. I differ from him.</p>
<p id='9'>शल्यसंपीडितं शस्तं नि:सन्तं तु लक्ष्मणम्। समस्तु दुःखसंतप्तं तं तु निःश्वासपीडितम्॥ मूर्धि चैनमुपाघ्राय भूयः संस्पृश्य च त्वरन्। उवाच लक्षमणं वाक्यमाश्वास्य पुरुषर्षभः॥<br />And moved with grief, that best of persons, Rama, smelling head of Laksmana, wounded with darts and having his person pierced (with salms, sighing and breathing hard-and nursing ms body with his hand, addressed Laksmana, soothing him.</p>

On that wickedminded enemy of mine having been destroyed, I am viciorious (in encounter). By luck, o hero, have you in conflict suvered the right arm of the fell Rävana. Verily he (Indrajit) was his stay.</p>
<p id='11'>विभीषणहनूमद्भयां कृतं कर्म महद्रणे॥ अहोरात्रस्त्रिभिर्वीरः कथंचिद्विनिपातितः। निमित्रः कृतोऽस्यद्य निर्यास्यति हि रावणः।।१६<br />Both Vibhīşaņa and Hanumān have done mighty deeds in battle.

<p id='12'>बलव्यूहेन महता निर्यास्यति हि रावणः। बलव्यूहेन महता श्रुत्वा पुत्रं निपातितम्॥ तं पुत्रवधसंतप्तं निर्यान्तं राक्षसाधिपम्। बलेनावृत्य महता निहनिष्यामि दुर्जयम्॥<br />Rāvana will for certain sally out, hearing his son brought down. That unconquerable lord of Rakşasas, aggrieved for the destruction of his son, marching out, shall I slay, environed with a mighty force.</p>
