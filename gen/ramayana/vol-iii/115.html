<h3>Yuddha Kanda: Chapter 115</h3><p id='1'>तां तु पार्श्वे स्थितां प्रह्वां रामः संमेक्ष्य मैथिलीम्। हृदयान्तर्गतं भावं व्याहर्तुमुपचक्रमे॥<br />Beholding Maithili standing humbly by him, Räma began to give vent to his pent-up feelings.</p>
<p id='2'>एषासि निर्जिता भद्रे शत्रु जित्वा रणाजिरे। पौरुषात् यदनुष्ठेयं मयैतदुपपादितम्॥<br />O gentle one, destroying all the enemies in the arena of battle I have subdued your enemy-I have done all that can be accomplished by manliness.</p>
<p id='3'>गतोऽस्म्यन्तममर्षस्य धर्षणा संप्रमार्जिता। अवमानश्च शत्रुश्च युगपत्रिहतौ मया॥<br />I have reached the other end of my anger, rubbed off (the insult) for my spouse being taken away by the enemy and have killed simultaneously my disgrace and enemy.</p>
<p id='4'>अद्य मे पौरुषं दृष्टमद्य मे सफलः श्रमः। अद्य तीर्णप्रतिज्ञोऽहं प्रभवाम्यद्य चात्मनः॥<br />My manliness has been displayed today, my laboúr has been crowned with success and today I have fulfilled my promise by my own prowess.</p>
<p id='5'>या त्वं विरहिता नीता चलचित्तेन रक्षसा। दैवसंपादितो दोषो मानुषेण मया जितः॥<br />That accidental misfortune, under the influence where of you were carried away by the fickle-minded Räksasa in my absence, has been subdued today by me, a man.</p>
<p id='6'>संप्राप्तमवमानं यस्तेजसा न प्रमार्जति। कस्तस्य पौरुषेणार्थो महताप्यल्पचेतसः॥<br />What is the use of his manliness, who when insulted, cannot remove it? Even if he be a great man he may be called mean.</p>
<p id='7'>लङ्घनं च समुद्रस्य लङ्कायाश्चापि मर्दनम्। सफलं तस्य च श्लाघ्यमद्य कर्म हनूमतः॥<br />The praise-worthy works of Hanumān-the crossing of the deep and the devastation of Lankā, have been crowned with success today.</p>
<p id='8'>युद्धे विक्रमतश्चैव हितं मन्त्रयतस्तया। सुग्रीवस्य ससैन्यस्य सफलोऽद्य परिश्रमः॥<br />The labour of Sugrīva with his army, who displayed valour in the encounter and gave me good counsels, has borne fruit today.</p>
<p id='9'>विभीषणस्य च तथा सफलोऽद्य परिश्रमः। विगुणं भ्रातरं त्यक्त्वा यो मां स्वयमुपस्थितः।।।।<br />Today also the labour of Vibhişaņa has borne fruit-who renouncing his brother, devoid of all good Qualities, came to my side.</p>
<p id='10'>इत्येवं वदतः श्रुत्वा सीता रामस्य तद्वचः। मृगीवोत्फुल्लनयना बभूवाश्रुपरिप्लुता ॥<br />Hearing those words of Rāma, Sītā began to look wistfully like a hind, with eyes full of tears.</p>
<p id='11'>पश्यतस्तां तु रामस्य समीपे हृदयप्रियाम्। जनवादभयाद्राज्ञो बभूव हृदयं द्विधा ॥<br />Beholding his beloved spouse near him and afraid of popular ignominy his heart was broken into two.</p>
<p id='12'>सीतामुत्पलपत्राक्षी नीलकुञ्चितमूर्धजाम्। अवदद्वै वरारोहां मध्ये वानररक्षसाम्॥<br />Thereupon he spoke to the exquisitely beautiful Sītā, in the midst of the monkeys and Räkşasas, having eyes resembling lotus petals and black and curling hairs, saying.</p>
<p id='13'>यत्कर्तव्यं मनुष्येण धर्षणां प्रतिमार्जता। तत्कृतं रावणं हत्वा मयेदं मानकाङ्क्षिणा॥ निर्जिता जीवलोकस्य तपसा भावितात्मना। अगस्त्येन दुराधर्षा मुनिना दक्षिणेव दिक् ॥<br />As the southern quarter, incapable of being got at by the people, was conquered by the selfcontrolled great ascetic Agasty, so for you slaying Ravana, I (always) anxious to have honour, have removed my insult-as is the duty of a man.</p>
<p id='14'>विदितश्चास्तु भद्रं ते योऽयं रणपरिश्रमः। सुतीर्णः सुहृदां वीर्यान्न त्वदर्थं मया कृतः॥<br />May good betide you-do you know that all my labour in the battle-field, backed by the prowess of my friends, is for you.</p>
<p id='15'>रक्षता तु मया वृत्तमपवादं च सर्वतः। प्रख्यातस्यात्मवंशस्य न्यङ्गं च परिमार्जता॥<br />To uphold the dignity of my well-known family, to remove the ignominy consequent upon your being stolen away as well as to wipe off my own insult I have encompassed this.</p>
<p id='16'>प्राप्तचारित्रसंदेहा मम प्रतिमुखे स्थिता। दीपो नेत्रातुरस्येव प्रतिकूलासि मे दृढा ॥<br />I have suspected your character; you, (Therefore) standing before me, are distressing me like to a lamp before one who is subject to an eye-desease.</p>
<p id='17'>तद्गच्छ त्वानुजानेऽद्य यथेष्टं जनकात्मजे। एता दश दिशो भद्रे कार्यमस्ति न मे त्वया॥<br />Do you therefore proceed, O daughter of king Janaka, wherever you like to one of these ten quarters. I permit you, O gentle one. I have nothing to do with you.</p>
<p id='18'>कः पुमांस्तु कुले जातः स्त्रियं परगृहोषिताम्। तेजस्वी पुनरादद्यात्सुहृल्लोभेन चेतसा ॥<br />What powerful man, born in a high family, take back his wife considering her as friend out of lust, who has lived long in another's house?</p>
<p id='19'>रावणाङ्कपरिक्लिष्टां दृष्टां दुष्टेन चक्षुषा। कथं त्वां पुनरादद्यां कुलं व्यपदिशन्महत्॥<br />You were taken by Rāvana on his lap, beheld by him with sinful eyes; how can I, taking you back, bring disgrace upon my great family?</p>
<p id='20'>यदर्थ निर्जिता मे त्वं सोऽयमासादितो मया। नास्ति मे त्वय्यभिष्वङ्गो यथेष्टं गम्यतामिति ॥<br />The object, with which I have gained you back, has been accomplished. I have got no attachment for you-do you go wherever you wish, O gentle one.</p>
<p id='21'>तदद्य व्याहृतं भद्रे मयैतत्कृतबुद्धिना। लक्ष्मणे वाथ भरते कुरु बुद्धिं यथासुखम्॥ शत्रुघ्ने वाथ सुग्रीवे राक्षसे वा विभीषणे। निवेशय मनः सीते यथा वा सुखमात्मना॥<br />I speak these to you impelled by my sense of duty. If you wish you may live with Laksmana, Bharatga or Satrughna or with Sugrīva or Räkş asa Vibhisana. Do you settle, O Sita, where you may find your own pleasure.</p>
<p id='22'>नहि त्वां रावणो दृष्ट्वा दिव्यरूपां मनोरमाम्। मर्षयत्यचिरं सीते स्वगृहे पर्यवस्थिताम्॥<br />O Sita, (I do not think) Ravana has overlooked you, who lived in his house, beholding you so graceful and beautiful.</p>
<p id='23'>ततः प्रियाहश्रवणा तदप्रियं प्रियादुपश्रुत्य चिरस्य मानिनी। मुमोच बाष्पं रुदती तदा भृशं गजेन्द्रहस्ताभिहतेव वल्लरी॥<br />Thereupon hearing those unpleasant words from her beloved (husband) Sītā, always sensitive and who had never heard such unpleasant words, trembling like a creeper torn by the trunk of an elephant, began to weep shedding tears profusely.</p>
