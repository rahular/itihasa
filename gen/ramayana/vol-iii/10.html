<h3>Yuddha Kanda: Chapter 10</h3><p id='1'>ततः प्रत्युषसि प्राप्ते प्राप्तधर्मार्थनिश्चयः। राक्षसाधिपतेर्वेश्म भीमकर्मा विभीषणः॥ शैलाग्रचयसंकाशं शैलशृङ्गमिवोन्नतम्। सुविभक्तमहाकक्ष महाजनपरिग्रहम्॥ मतिमद्भिर्महामात्रैरनुरक्तैरधिष्ठितम्। राक्षसैराप्तपर्याप्तैः सर्वतः परिरक्षितम्॥ मत्तमातङ्गनिःश्वासैर्व्याकुलीकृतमारुतम्। शङ्खघोषमहाघोषं तूर्यसंबाधनादितम्॥ प्रमदाजनसंबाधं प्रजल्पितमहापथम्। तप्तकाञ्चननिहं भूषणोत्तमभूषितम्॥ गन्धर्वाणामिवावासमालयं मरुतामिव । रत्नसंचयसंबाधं भवनं भोगिनामिव॥ तं महाभ्रमिवादित्यस्तेजोविस्तृतरश्मिवान्। अग्रजस्यालयं वीरः प्रविवेश महाद्युतिः॥<br />Then early in the morning, like the fiery and refulgent sun entering a mighty mass of clouds, Vibhisana, fast to virtue and interest, heroic and possessed of exceeding splendour, playing a perilous part, * entered the apartment of his elder brother, resembling an assemblage of mountain summits and elevated like the peak of a mountain, orderly, divided into spacious rooms, the resort of the great-inhabited by august and intelligent persons attached (to Răvaņa); guarded around by lusty Rakşasas in limited numbers; having the air agitated by the breath of mad elephants; with loud blares of conchs, and resounding with trumpets; with loud blares of conchs, and resounding with trumpets; embosoming numbers of beautiful damsels, with its high-ways (overflowing with talk); furnished with doors of polished gold; embellished with excellent ornaments; resembling the abode of the Gandharvas, or the mansion of the Maruts; containing heaps of gems; like to the dwelling of serpents. *The project he had conceived, viz., converting Rāvana to his own polloy of pacification, was fraught with peril to himself, considering his brother's fierce temperament.</p>
<p id='2'>पुण्यान्पुण्याहघोषांश्च वेदविद्भिदाहृतान्। शुश्राव सुमहातेजा भ्रातुर्विजयसंश्रितान् ॥ पूजितान्दधिपात्रैश्च सर्पिभिः सुमनोक्षतैः। मन्त्रवेदविदो विप्रान्ददर्श स महाबलः॥<br />That one of exceeding energy heard sacred and holy sounds uttered by Veda-versed Brāhmaṇas celebrating the victory of his brother; and that highly powerful (hero) acquainted with Mantras and the Vedas saw Vipras worshipped with vessels of curds, clarified butter, flowers and fried paddy.</p>
<p id='3'>स पूज्यमानो रक्षोभिर्दीप्यमानं स्वतेजसा। आसनस्थं महाबाहुर्ववन्दे धनदानुजम्॥<br />The mighty-armed (Vibhisana) saluted the younger brother of the bestower of riches, * seated there. *Kuvera-Ravana was Kuvera's younger brother.</p>
<p id='4'>स राजदृष्टिसंपन्नमासनं हेमभूषितम्। जगाम समुदाचारं प्रयुज्याचारकोविदः॥<br />That one acquainted with manners, after proper courtesy, sat him down on a seat decked in gold, which was pointed out (by a royal glance).</p>
<p id='5'>स रावणं महात्मानं विजने मन्त्रिसंनिधौ। उवाच हितमत्यर्थं वचनं हेतुनिश्चितम्॥ प्रसाद्य भ्रातरं ज्येष्ठं सान्त्वेनोपस्थितक्रमः। देशकालार्थसंवादि दृष्टलोकपरावरः॥<br />In retirement as also in presence only of his counsellors, Vibhīşaņa spoke to the high souled Rāvana words backed by reason, and greatly fraught with his welfare. And having, with soothing speech, pacified his elder brother and extended towards him the due civilities, that one, who through height of sentiment had noted excellence and the want of it, addressed (Vibhīş aņa) in words befitting the occasion and the place.</p>
<p id='6'>यदाप्रभृति वैदेही संप्राप्तेह परंतप। तदाप्रभृति दृश्यन्ते निमित्तान्यशुभानि नः॥<br />Ever since, O subduer of enemies, Vaidehi has come hither, are seen inauspicious omens.</p>
<p id='7'>सस्फुलिङ्गः सधूमार्चिः सधूमकलुषोदयः। मन्त्रसङ्घहुतोऽप्यग्निर्न सम्यगभिवर्धते॥<br />Fire, enveloped in smoke at the time of its being ignited, and thereafter throwing out scintillation's, with its brightness obscured by vapour, does not increase adequately even n oblations being poured into it with Mantras,</p>
<p id='8'>अग्निष्टेष्वग्निशालासु तथा ब्रह्मस्थलीषु च। सरीसृपाणि दृश्यन्ते हव्येषु च पिपीलिकाः॥<br />Reptiles are discovered in kitchens, sacrificial fire-chambers, and the places of Vaidika recitations; and ants (are found) in clarified butter.</p>
<p id='9'>गवां पयांसि स्कन्नानि विमदा वरकुञ्जराः। दीनमश्वाः प्रहेषन्ते नवग्रासाभिनन्दिनः॥<br />The milk of the kine has been dried up; and the nobler elephants are without the temporal juice. And horses, albeit they have feasted on feasted on fresh grass, neigh distressfully.* *The commentator remarks, evidently with justice, "That is, the horses, having eaten their fill, still hunger."</p>
<p id='10'>खरोष्ट्रश्वतरा राजन्भिन्नरोमाः सवन्ति च। न स्वभावेऽवतिष्ठन्ते विधानैरपि चिन्तिताः॥<br />Asses, camels and mules, O king, with their hair standing erect, shed tears; and although they are ministered to medically, they do not return to nature.</p>
<p id='11'>वायसाः सङ्घशः क्रूरा व्याहरन्ति समन्ततः। समवेताश्च दृश्यन्ते विमानाग्रेषु सङ्घशः॥<br />And crows in numbers emit harsh cries on all sides, and are seen in swarms at the tops of edifices.</p>
<p id='12'>गृध्राश्च परिलीयन्ते पुरीमुपरि पीडिताः। उपपन्नाश्च संध्ये द्वे व्याहरन्त्यशिवं शिवाः॥<br />Vultures sit sadly and distressed upon the roofs of houses. During the two twilights, the jackals, coming in sight, utter ominous howls.</p>
<p id='13'>क्रव्यादानां मृगाणां च पुरीद्वारेषु सङ्घशः। श्रूयन्ते विपुला घोषाः सविस्फूर्जतनिःस्वनाः॥<br />Wolves and other (ferocious) animals, as well as deer, approaching the gate of the palace in swarms, are heard to set up loud roars resembling the thunder.</p>
<p id='14'>तदेवं प्रस्तुते कार्ये प्रायश्चित्तमिदं क्षमम्। रोचये वीर वैदेही राघवाय प्रदीयताम्॥<br />Things having come to this pass, even this expiation, I fancy, is capable of removing the evil omens. Do you render back Vaidehī to Raghava.</p>
<p id='15'>इदं च यदि वा मोहाल्लोभाद्वा व्याहृतं मया। तत्रापि च महाराज न दोषं कर्तुमर्हसि ॥<br />If I have said this through ignorance or covetousness, you ought not, O mighty monarch, criminate me.</p>
<p id='16'>अयं हि दोषः सर्वस्य जनस्यास्योपलक्ष्यते। रक्षसां राक्षसीनां च पुरस्यान्तःपुरस्य च ॥<br />All Rākşasas and Rākşasis, as well as those belonging to palace and the inner apartmentshall have to experience the even consequence (of this act of your).</p>
<p id='17'>प्रापणे चास्य मन्त्रस्य निवृत्ताः सर्वमन्त्रिणः। अवश्यं च मया वाच्यं यदृष्टमथवा श्रुतम्।। संविधाय यथान्यायं तद्भवान्कर्तुमर्हति॥<br />All the counsellors have refrained from tendering this counsel to you; but surely I must tell you what I have seen or heard; and adopting proper measures, it behove you to act so.* *In accordance with my suggestion.</p>
<p id='18'>इति स्वमन्त्रिणां मध्ये भ्राता भ्रातरमूचिवान्। रावणं रक्षसां श्रेष्ठं पथ्यमेतद्विभीषणः॥<br />(Ravana's) brother, Vibhisana, thus spoke, to his brother, the chief of Rākşasa, in the midst of counsellors, these words fraught with his good.</p>
<p id='19'>हितं महाथ मृदु हेतुसंहितं व्यतीतकालायतिसंप्रतिक्षमम्। निशम्य तद्वाक्यमुपस्थितज्वरः प्रसङ्गवानुत्तरमेतदब्रवीत्॥ भयं न पश्यामि कुतश्चिदप्यहं न राघवः प्राप्स्यति जातु मैथिलीम्। सुरैः सहेन्द्रैरपि संगरे कथं ममाग्रतः स्थास्यति लक्ष्मणाग्रजः॥<br />Hearing this beneficial, mild and pregnant speech, fortified by reasons and capable of compassing (his welfare) for the present, past and the future, (Rāvaņa) who had conceived a passion (for Sītā), getting into a rage, replied, Fear find I none whatever. Rāghava never shall have Mithila's daughter. Even if Laksmana's elder brother should be supported in battle by the celestials with Indra (at their head), how can he stay before me (in the field)?</p>
<p id='20'>इत्येवमुक्त्वा सुरसैन्यनाशनो महाबलः संयति चण्डविक्रमः। दशाननो भ्रातरमाप्तवादिनं विसर्जयामास तदा विभीषणम्॥<br />Having said this, that destroyer of celestial hosts, the Ten-necked one, possessed of mighty strength and of terrific prowess in battle, then dismissed his brother Vibhīşaņa, who had spoken truth.</p>
