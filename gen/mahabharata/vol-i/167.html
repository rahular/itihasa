<h3>CHAITRARATHA PARVA: Chapter 167</h3><h4>Birth of Dhrishtadyumna</h4><p id='1'>ब्राह्मण उवाच अमर्षी दुपदो राजा कर्मसिद्धान् द्विजर्षभान्। अन्विच्छन् परिचक्राम ब्राह्मणावसथान् बहून्॥<br />The Brahmana said : Sorrowful in mind and afflicted with grief, the king Drupada wandered among the hermitages of many Brahmanas, all experts in sacrificial rites.</p>
<p id='2'>पुत्रजन्म परीप्सन् वै शोकोपहतचेतनः। नास्ति श्रेष्ठमपत्यं मे इति नित्यमचिन्तयत्॥<br />Afflicted with grief and eagerly desirous of offspring, the daily thought, "Alas! I have no excellent son."</p>
<p id='3'>जातान् पुत्रान् स निर्वेदाद् धिग् बन्धूनिति चाब्रवीत् निःश्वासपरमश्चासीद् द्रोणं प्रतिचिकीर्षया॥<br />He always said in despondency, "Fie on those children and relatives that I have!" He always sighed thinking of revenging himself of Drona.</p>
<p id='4'>प्रभावं विनयं शिक्षा द्रोणस्य चरितानि च। क्षात्रेण च बलेनास्य चिन्तयन् नाध्यगच्छत्॥ प्रतिकर्तुं नृपश्रेष्ठो यतमानोऽपि भारत। अभितः सोऽथ कल्माषीं गङ्गाकूले परिभ्रमन्॥ ब्राह्मणावसथं पुण्यमाससाद महीपतिः। तत्र नास्नातकः कश्चिन्न चासीदव्रती द्विजः॥<br />O descendant of Bharata, even after much deliberation, that best of kings, (Drupada) did not find any means to overcome the prowess, the discipline, the raining and the accomplishments of Drona by his Kshatriya might. Wandering about the king came (at last) to the hermitage of a Brahmana situate on the banks of the holy Gangas. There was no Brahmana who was not a Snataka and none who was not of rigid vows.</p>
<p id='5'>तथैव च महाभागः सोऽपश्यत् संशितव्रतौ। याजोपयाजौ ब्रह्मर्षी शाम्यन्तौ परमेष्ठिनौ॥<br />There saw that illustrious king two (Brahmanas) named Yaja and Upayaja, both were of rigid vows, both were self controlled and both belonged to the highest order.</p>
<p id='6'>संहिताध्ययने युक्तौ गोत्रतश्चापि काश्यपौ। तारणेयौ युक्तरूपौ ब्राह्मणावृषिसत्तमौ॥<br />They belonged to the race of Kashyapa and they were engaged in studying the Institutes. Those two Brahmana Rishi were quite capable of helping the king.</p>
<p id='7'>स तावामन्त्रयामास सर्वकामैरतन्द्रितः। बुद्धवा बलं तयोस्तत्र कनीयांसमुपह्वरे॥ प्रपेदे छन्दयन् कामैरुपयाजं धृतव्रतम्। पादशुश्रूषणे युक्तः प्रियवाक् सर्वकामदः॥ अर्चयित्वा यथान्यायमुपयाजमुवाच सः। येन मे कर्मणा ब्रह्मन् पुत्रः स्याद् द्रोणमृत्यवे॥ उपयाज कृते तस्मिन् गवां दातास्मि तेऽव॒दम्। यद् वा तेऽन्यद् द्विजश्रेष्ठ मनसः सुप्रियं भवेत्। सर्वं तत् ते प्रदाताहं न हि मे मेऽत्रास्ति संशयः॥<br />Having brought his senses under control, he with all earnestness worshipped and served them. Knowing the superiority of the younger of the two. The worshipped in private Upayaja of rigid vows, by offering him every desired object, by serving at his feet and by becoming sweet speeches. Worshipping him in due from, he (Drupada) said to Upayaja, “O Brahmana, if you perform that sacrifice which may give me a son who can kill Drona, O Upayaja, on your doing this, I shall give you ten crore kine. O best of Brahmanas, I am ready to bestow on you whatever else be in your mind and whatever which is agreeable to you. There is no doubt about it.</p>
<p id='8'>इत्युक्तो नाहमित्येवं तमृषिः प्रत्यभाषत। आराधयिष्यन् दुपदः स तं पर्यचरत् पुनः॥<br />Having been thus addressed, the Rishi replied to him, “I cannot." Thereupon Drupada again began to worship and serve him.</p>
<p id='9'>ततः संवत्सरस्यान्ते द्रुपदं स द्विजोत्तमः। उपयाजोऽब्रवीत् काले राजन् मधुरया गिरा॥ ज्येष्ठो भ्राता ममागृहणाद् विचरन् गहने वने। अपरिज्ञातशौचायां भूमौ निपतितं फलम्॥<br />O king, after the expiration of a year, that best of the twice born, Upayaja, spoke thus to Drupada in sweet words, "My eldest brother while roving in a dense forest took up a fruit that had fallen on the ground, not knowing that it was unclean.</p>
<p id='10'>तदपश्यमहं भ्रातुरसाम्प्रतमनुव्रजन्। विमर्श संकरादाने नायं कुर्यात् कदाचन॥<br />I was following him and I saw this unworthy act of my brother. He never scruples to take impure things.</p>
<p id='11'>दृष्ट्वा फलस्य नापश्यद् दोषान् पापानुबन्धकान्। विविनक्ति न शौचं यः सोऽन्यत्रापि कथं भवेत्॥<br />In taking that fruit he didnot see any impropriety of a sinful nature. One who does not observe purity (in one thing) is expected not to observe it in other things.</p>
<p id='12'>संहिताध्ययनं कुर्वन् वसन् गुरुकुले च यः। भैक्ष्यमुत्सृष्टमन्येषां भुङ्क्ते स्म च यदा तदा॥ कीर्तयन् गुणमन्नानामघृणी च पुनः पुनः। तं वै फलार्थिनं मन्ये भ्रातरं तर्कचक्षुषा॥<br />When he lived in the preceptor's house reading in the Institutes, he used often to eat without any scruples in his mind the remnants of other people's food. He again and again speaks highly of food; and he has no hatred for anything. Arguing from this I see that he desires for earthly acquisitions.</p>
<p id='13'>तं वै गच्छस्व नृपते स त्वां संयाजयिष्यति। जुगुप्समानो नृपतिर्मनसेदं विचिन्तयन्।॥ उपयाजवचः श्रुत्वा याजस्याश्रमभ्यगात्। अभिसम्पूज्य पूजार्हमथ याजमुवाच ह॥ अयुतानि ददान्यष्टौ गवां याजय मां विभो। द्रोणवैराभिसंतप्तं प्रह्लादयितुमर्हसि॥<br />"O king go to him, he will performs sacrifices for you.” Having heard those words of Upayaja, the king, though he entertained a low opinion of Yaja, went to his house. Worshipping him who was worthy of worship, he thus spoke to him, “O lord, I shall give you eighty thousand kine; perform my spatial actions. I am brunt by my feelings of enmity towards Drona. You should cool my heart.</p>
<p id='14'>स हि ब्रह्मविदां श्रेष्ठो ब्रह्मास्त्रे चाप्यनुत्तमः। तस्माद् द्रोणः पराजैष्ट मां वै स सखिविग्रहे॥<br />That foremost of men, learned in the Vedas (Drona) is skilled in the Brahma weapon. Therefore, Drona has defeated me in a contest arising out of a quarrel on friendship.</p>
<p id='15'>क्षत्रियो नास्ति तस्यास्यां पृथिव्यां कश्चिदग्रणीः। कौरवाचार्यमुख्यस्य भारद्वाजस्य धीमतः॥<br />The greatly intelligent son of Bharadvaja (Drona) is now the chief preceptor of the Kurus. There is no Kshatriya in the world who is superior to him.</p>
<p id='16'>द्रोणस्य शरजालानि प्राणिदेहहराणि च। षडरनि धनुश्चास्य दृश्यते परमं महत्॥ स हि ब्राह्मणवेषेण क्षात्रं वेगमसंशयम्। प्रतिहन्ति महेष्वासो भारद्वाजो महामनाः॥<br />His arrows are capable of killing every living being, his bow is full six cubits long and it looks exceedingly great. That high-souled ' great bowman, that son of Bharadvaja (Drona,) attired in the Brahmanic garb, is destroying the Kshatriya might.</p>
<p id='17'>क्षत्रोच्छेदाय विहितो जामदग्न्य इवास्थितः। तस्य ह्यस्त्रबलं घोरमप्रधृष्यं नरैर्भुवि॥<br />Like the son of Jamadagni, Parshurama, he is engaged in annihilating the Kshatriyas. There is no man on earth who can overcome the terrible force of his arms.</p>
<p id='18'>ब्राह्यं संधारयंस्तेजो हुताहुतिरिवानलः। समेत्य स दहत्याजौ क्षात्रधर्मपुरस्सरः॥<br />Like blazing fire fed with ghee, Drona, possessing both the Brahma inight and the Kshatriya might consumes every antagonist in battle.</p>
<p id='19'>ब्रह्मक्षत्रे च विहिते ब्राह्म तेजो विशिष्यते। सोऽहं क्षात्राद् बलाद्धीनो ब्राह्मं तेजः प्रपेदिवान्॥<br />Your Brahma might is superior to his Brahma might though his is amited with his Kshatriya might. As I am interior (to Drona) in consequence of my having only Kshatriya might, therefore, give me your Brahma might.</p>
<p id='20'>द्रोणाद् विशिष्टमासाद्य भवन्तं ब्रह्मवित्तमम्। द्रोणान्तकमहं पुत्रं लभेयं युधि दुर्जयम्॥ तत् कर्म कुरु मे याज वितराम्यर्बुदं गवाम्। तथेत्युक्त्वा तु तं याजो याज्यार्थमुपकल्पयत्॥<br />As I have got you who is superior to Drona in Brahma might, O Yaja, perform that sacrifice by which I can obtain a son, who is invincible and who can kill Drona in battle. I am ready to give you ten crore kine.” Saying, "Be it so," Yaja recollected the various particulars of the sacrifice in question.</p>
<p id='21'>गुर्वर्थ इति चाकाममुपयाजमचोदयत्। याजो द्रोणविनाशाय प्रतिजज्ञे तथा च सः॥ ततस्तस्य नरेन्द्रस्य उपयाजो महातपाः। भाचख्यौ कर्म वैतानं तदा पुत्रफलाय वै॥<br />Knowing the gravity of the matter, he asked the assistance of Upayaja who covered nothing. Then Yaja promised to perform the sacrifice for the destruction of Drona. Thereupon the great ascetic Upayaja spoke to the king (Drupada) all that is required for the sacrifice from which the king was to obtain offspring.</p>
<p id='22'>स च पुत्रो महावीर्यो महातेजा महाबलः। इष्यते यद्धिधो राजन् भविता ते तथाविधः॥<br />Upayaja said: O king, a son will be born to you who will possess, as you desire. great prowess, great energy and great strength.</p>
<p id='23'>भारद्वाजस्य हन्तारं सोऽभिसंधाय भूपतिः। आजहें तत् तथा सर्वं द्रुपदः कर्मसिद्धये॥<br />The Brahmana said : Then king Drupada, being desirous of obtaining a son who was to slay the son of Bharadvaja (Drona) began to make the necessary preparations for the success of his wish.</p>
<p id='24'>याजस्तु हवनस्यान्ते देवीमाज्ञापयत् तदा। प्रेहि मां राज्ञि पृषति मिथुनं त्वामुपस्थितम्॥<br />Yaja then poured libations of ghee on the sacrificial fire and ordered the queen thus, “O daughter-in-law of Prishata, come here a son and a daughter have come for you.</p>
<p id='25'>राज्युवाच अवलिप्तं मुखं ब्रह्मन् दिव्यान् गन्धान बिभर्मिच। सुतार्थे नोपलब्धास्मि तिष्ठ याज मम प्रिये॥<br />The Queen said: O Brahmana, my mouth is filled with saffron and other perfumes; my body bears many sweet scents; I am not now fit for accepting the sacrificial ghee which would give me offspring. O Yaja, wait for me a little, for that happy consummation.</p>
<p id='26'>याज उवाच याजेन श्रपितं हव्यमुपयाजाभिमन्त्रितम्। कथं कामं न संदध्यात् सा त्वं विप्रेहि तिष्ठ वा॥<br />Yaja said : Whether you come or wait, why should not the object of this sacrifice be accomplished when the oblation has already been prepared by me and sanctified by Upayaja's invocations!</p>
<p id='27'>ब्राह्मण उवाच एवमुक्त्वा तु याजेन हुते हविषि संस्कृते। उत्तस्थौ पावकात् तस्मात् कुमारो देवसंनिभः॥<br />The Brahmana said: Having said this, the sacrificial priest (Yaja) poured the sanctified libation on the fore, whereupon arose from those flames a celestials like boy.</p>
<p id='28'>ज्वालावर्णो घोररूपः किरीटी वर्म चोत्तमम्। बिभ्रत् सखङ्गः सशरो धनुष्मान् विनदन् मुहुः॥<br />He was as effulgent as the fire; he was terrible to look at; he had a crown on his head; and his body was encased in an excellent armour; he had a sword in his hand, carried a bow and arrows and he frequently sent forth loud roars.</p>
<p id='29'>सोऽध्यारोहद् रथवरं तेन च प्रययौ तदा। ततः प्रणेदुः पञ्चालाः प्रहृष्टाः साधु साध्विति॥<br />As soon as he was born, he got on an excellent car and went about. Thereupon the Panchalas should in great joy “Blessed, blessed."</p>
<p id='30'>हर्षाविष्टांस्ततश्चैतान् नेयं सेहे वसुंधरा। भयापहो राजपुत्रः पाञ्चालानां यशस्करः॥ राज्ञः शोकापहो जात एष द्रोणवधाय वै। इत्युवाच महद् भूतमदृश्यं खेचरं तदा॥<br />The very earth appeared to be unable to bear the weight of the madly joyous Panchalas. “The price has been born for the destruction of Drona. He will dispel all the fears of the Panchalas and spread their fame. He will also remove the grief of the king.” Thus said the greatly wonderful voice of the sky managing beings.</p>
<p id='31'>कुमारी चापि पाञ्चाली वेदमिध्यात् समुत्थिता। सुभगा दर्शनीयाङ्गी स्वसितायतलोचनाः॥ श्यामा पद्मपलाशाक्षी नीलकुञ्चितमूर्धजा। ताम्रतुङ्गनखी सुभ्रूश्चारुपीनपयोधरा॥<br />There rose from the (sacrificial alter) a daughter, called Panchali, who was blessed with good fortune; she was beautiful her eyes were smiling and large. Her complexion was dark, her eyes were like lotus leaves, her hair was blue and curly, her nails were beautifully carved and they were like bright copper, her eyebrows were fair, her breasts were rising and her things tapering.</p>
<p id='32'>मानुषं विग्रहं कृत्वा साक्षादमरवर्णिनी। नीलोत्पलसमो गन्धो यस्याः क्रोशात् प्रधावति॥<br />She was veritable celestials maiden born among men. The sweet fragrance of the blue lotus emitted from her body and it was perceptible from a distance of full two miles,</p>
<p id='33'>या बिभर्ति परं रूपं यस्या नास्त्युपमा भुवि। देवदानवयक्षाणामीप्सितां देवरूपिणीम्॥<br />Her beauty was such that she had no equal on earth. The Devas, the Danavas and the Yakshas could desire that celestials like beauty.</p>
<p id='34'>तां चापि जातां सुश्रोणी वागुवाचाशरीरिणी। सर्वयाषिद्वरा कृष्णा निनीषुः क्षत्रियान् क्षयम्॥<br />When this beauty of fair hips was born, an invisible voice said, “This beauty of dark complexion will be the cause of the women and she will be the cause of the destruction of the Kshatriyas.</p>
<p id='35'>सुरकार्यमियं काले करिष्यति सुमध्यमा। अस्या हेतोः कौरवाणां महदुत्पत्स्यते भयम्॥<br />"This lady of slender waist will in time accomplish the works of gods. From her will arise many fears (dangers) to the Kurus."</p>
<p id='36'>तच्छ्रुत्वा सर्वपाञ्चालाः प्रणेदुः सिंहसङ्घवत्। न चैतान् हर्षसम्पूर्णानियं सेहे वसुंधरा॥<br />Hearing this all the Panchalas uttered a loud leonine roars. The earth was unable to bear the weight of the madly joyous Panchalas.</p>
<p id='37'>तौ दृष्ट्वा पार्षती याज प्रपेदे वै सुतार्थिनी। न वै मदन्यां जननी जानीयातामिमाविति॥<br />The daughter-in-law of Prishata, seeing the two (the boy and the daughter) and being desirous of getting them, came to Yaja and said, “Let not these two know anyone else except myself as their mother."</p>
<p id='38'>तथेत्युवाच तं याजो राज्ञः प्रियचिकीर्षया। तयोश्च नामनी चक्रुद्धिजाः सम्पूर्णमानसाः॥<br />Desiring to do good to the king (Drupada) Yaja said, “Be it so." Thereupon the Brahmanas whose wishes were completely gratified (by present) gave these two (children) names.</p>
<p id='39'>धृष्टत्वादत्यमर्षित्वाद् द्युम्नाद्युत्सम्भवादपि। धृष्टद्युम्नः कुमारोऽयं दुपदस्य भवत्विति॥<br />(They said,) “Because this son of Drupada possesses excessive audacity and because he has been born like Dyumna with a natural armour of weapons, let him be called Dhrishtadyumna.</p>

<p id='41'>धृष्टद्युम्नं तु पाञ्चाल्यमानीय स्वं निवेशनम्। उपाकरोदस्त्रहेतोर्भारद्वाजः प्रतापवान्॥ अमोक्षणीयं दैवं हि भावि मत्वा महामतिः। तथा तत् कृतवान् द्रोण आत्मकीर्त्यनुरक्षणात्॥<br />Then Drona brought the Panchala prince Dhrishtadyumna to his own house and taught him all weapons as a requital of taking the half of the kingdom of Drupada. Regarding Destiny to be inevitable, the illustrious son of Bharadvaja did what would perpetuate his own deeds.</p>
