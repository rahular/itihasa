<h3>VAIVAHIKA PARVA: Chapter 193</h3><h4>Conversation between the Priest and Yudhisthira</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच ततस्तथोक्तः परिहृष्टरूपः पित्रे शशंसाथ स राजपुत्रः। धृष्टद्युम्न: सोमकानां प्रवों वृत्तं यथा येन हृता च कृष्णा॥<br />Vulshanipayana said : Having been thus addressed, that foremost of the lunar race, the prince Dhrishtaduymna, cheerfully said to his father all that had happened and by whom Krishna (Draupadi) had been won.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>धृष्टद्युम्न उवाच योऽसौ युवा व्यायतलोहिताक्षः कृष्णाजिनी देवसमानरूपः। यः कार्मुकाग्र्यं कृतवानधिज्यं लक्ष्यं च यः पातितवान् पृथिव्याम्॥ असज्जमानश्च ततस्तरस्वी वृतो द्विजाग्र्यैरभिपूज्यमानः। चक्राम वज्रीव दितेः सुतेषु सर्वेश्च देवै ऋषिभिश्च जुष्टः॥<br />Dhrishtaduymna said : The Youth with large and red eyes, who was attired in back deer skin and looked like a celestials in beauty, who stringed the foremost of bows and brought down on earth the mark set on high, was soon surrounded by all the foremost of Brahmanas, who offered him their homage for the feat he had achieved. Incapable of bearing the sight of the foes and endued with great activity, he(the youth) displayed his prowess. Surrounded by the Brahinanas he resembled like the celestials and the Rishis.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>कृष्णा प्रगृह्याजिनमन्वयात् तं नागं यथा नागवधूः प्रहृष्टा। अमृष्यमाणेषु नराधिपेषु क्रुद्धेषु वै तत्र समापतत्सु॥<br />As a female elephant follows the leader of a herd so Krishna cheerfully followed him, catching hold of his deer skin. Being unable of bearing that sight the assembled kings rose up in anger and advanced to fight.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>ततोऽपरः पार्थिवसङ्घमध्ये प्रवृद्धमारुज्य महीप्ररोहम्। प्रकालयन्नेव स पार्थिवौघान् क्रुद्धोऽन्तकः प्राणभृतो यथैव॥<br />O king, then there rose in the arena another hero, who tore up a large tree and rushed against the kings (felling them right and left), as angry Yama smites down all living creatures.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>तौ पार्थिवानां मिषतां नरेन्द्र कृष्णामुपादाय गतौ नराग्यौ। विभ्राजमानाविव चन्द्रसूर्यो बाह्यां पुराद् भार्गवकर्मशालाम्॥<br />O king, the assembled kings stood motionless looking at these two best of heroes among men. While they, resembling like the sun and the moon, took Krishna with them and went away to a potter's house (situated) outside the city.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>तत्रोपविष्टार्जिरिवानलस्य तेषां जनित्रीति मम प्रतर्कः। रुपोपविष्टैस्त्रिभिरग्निकल्पैः॥<br />There (in the potter's house) sat a lady, as effulgent as a flame of fire, who I believe, is their mother. Around her also sat three foremost of men, each of when was like a fire.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>तस्यास्ततस्तावभिवाद्य पादौ उक्ता च कृष्णा त्वभिवादयेति। स्थितां च तत्रैव निवेद्य कृष्णां भिक्षाप्रचाराय गता नराग्र्याः॥<br />Coming to her, the two heroes paid homage to her feet and asked Krishna "To do homage to her.” Keeping Krishna there, those foremost of men all went out in their begging tour.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>तेषां तु भैक्षं प्रतिगृह्य कृष्णा दत्त्वा बलिं ब्राह्मणसाच्च कृत्वा। तां चैव वृद्धां परिवेष्य तांश्च नरप्रवीरान् स्वयमष्यभुक्त।॥<br />(When they returned), Krishna took from them the food (that they had obtained in alms) and offered a portion to the gods and gave away another portion to the Brahmanas. She gave a portion to that venerable lady and distributed the rest to those foremost of men; she herself ate last of all.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>सुप्तास्तु ते पार्थिव सर्व एवं कृष्णा च तेषां चरणोपधाने। आसीत् पृथिव्यां शयनं च तेषां दर्भाजिनानास्तरणोपपन्नम्॥<br />O king, they then all laid themselves down for sleep, Krishna lying like their nether pillow. The bed on which they lay was made of Kusha grass, on which they spread their deer skins.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>ते नर्दमाना इव कालमेधाः कथा विचित्राः कथयाम्बभूवुः। न वैश्यशूद्रौपयिकी: कथास्ता न च द्विजानां कथयन्ति वीराः॥<br />They talked on various subjects in voices deep as those heroes were such that neither Vaishyas, nor Shudras, nor Brahmanas could talk in that way.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>नि:संशयं क्षत्रियपुङ्गवास्ते यथा हि युद्धं कथयन्ति राजन्। आशा हि नो व्यक्तमियं समृद्धा मुक्तान् हि पार्थाञ्छृणुमोऽग्निदाहात्॥<br />O king, there is no doubt that they are foremost of Kshatriyas, their conversations being on all military subjects. Our hope has been fulfilled. We have heard that the sons of Pritha escaped from the conflagration.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>यथा हि लक्ष्यं निहतं धनुश्च सज्यं कृतं तेन तथा प्रसा। यथा हि भापन्ति परस्परं ते छन्ना ध्रुवं ते प्रचरन्ति पार्थाः॥<br />From the way in which the mark was shot down by the youth, the strength with which the bow was stringed by him and the manner in which they talked to one another, it is certain they are the sons of Pritha wandering in disguise.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>ततः स राजा दुपदः प्रहृष्टः पुरोहितं प्रेषयामास तेषाम्। विद्याम् युष्मानिति भाषमाणो महात्मानः पाण्डुसुतास्तु कच्चित्॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Thereupon the king Drupada became exceedingly pleased and he sent to then his priest, directing him to ascertain who they were and whether they were (really) the sons of the illustrious Pandu.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>गृहीतवाक्यो नृपतेः पुरोधा गत्वा प्रंशसामभिधाय तेषाम्। दुवाच चानुक्रमविक्रमेण॥<br />As directed by the king, the priest went to them; and applauding them all, he told them duly in detail all that he was commanded by the monarch to say.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>विज्ञातुमिच्छत्यवनीश्वरो वः पाञ्चालराजो वरदो वरार्हाः। लक्ष्यस्य वेद्धारमिमं हि दृष्ट्वा हर्षस्य नान्तं प्रतिपद्यते सः॥<br />The Priest said: O men that deserve first worship, the boon giving king of the earth, the lord of Panchala, (Drupada) is desirous to know who you are. Seeing this (hero) who has shot down the mark, his joy knows no bound.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>आख्यात च ज्ञातिकुलानुपूर्वी पदं शिरस्सु द्विषतां कुरुध्वम्। प्रह्लादयध्वं हृदयं ममेदं पाञ्चालराजस्य च सानुगस्य॥<br />Giving us all particulars of your family and tribe, place your feet on the heads of your enemies and gladden the hearts of the Panchala king and his men and of mine also.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>पाण्डुर्हि राजा द्रुपदस्य राज्ञः प्रियः सखा चात्मसमो बभूव। तस्यैष कामो दुहिता ममेयं स्नुषां प्रदास्यामि हि कौरवाय॥<br />King Pandu was a dear friend of king Draupada who regarded him as his counter self. He had all along cherished the desire of bestowing his this daughter on that Kuru prince (Pandu) as his daughter-in-law.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>अयं हि कामो दुपदस्य राज्ञो हदि स्थितो नित्यमनिन्दिताङ्गाः। धर्मेण विन्देत सुतां ममैताम्॥<br />O heroes of faultless features, it was the wish in the heart of the king Drupada that the long and strong armed Arjuna should marry in due religious form his this daughter.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>कृतं हि तत्स्यात् सत्कृतं ममेदं यशश्च पुण्यं च हितं तदेतत्। अथोक्तवाक्यं हि पुरोहितं स्थितं ततो विनीतं समुदीक्ष्य राजा॥ समीपतो भीममिदं शशास प्रदीयतां पाद्यमर्थ्य तथास्मै। मान्यः पुरोधा द्रुपदस्य राज्ञः तस्मै प्रयोज्याभ्यधिका हि पूजा॥<br />If that has become possible, nothing could be better, nothing more beneficial and nothing more conductive to fame and virtue than that incident. Having said this, the priest became silent. The king (Yudhishthira) seeing him thus sitting with humility said, “Let water to wash his fact and the Arghya be offered to this Brahmana. He is king Drupada's priest and therefore he is worthy of our respect. We should worship him with more than ordinary reverence.”</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>भीमस्ततस्तत् कृतवान् नरेन्द्र तां चैव पूजां प्रतिगृह्य हर्षात्। सुखोपविष्टं तु पुरोहितं तदा युधिष्ठरो ब्राह्मणमित्युवाच॥<br />O king, Bhima then did as directed. Accepting the worship thus offered to him, he (the priest) became exceedingly glad; and then Yudhishthira thus addressed that priest sitting in comfort.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>पाञ्चालराजेन सुता निसृष्टा स्वधर्मदृष्टेन यथा न कामात्। प्रदिष्टशुल्का द्रुपदेन राज्ञा सा तेन वीरेण तथानुवृत्ता॥ न तत्र वर्णेषु कृता विवक्षा न चापि शीले न कुले न गोत्रे। कृतेन सज्येन हि कार्मुकेण विद्धन लक्ष्येण हि सा विसृष्टा॥<br />Yudhishthira said: By fixing a special kind of dower the Panchala king, has given away his daughter according to the practice of his order. He has not done it freely. Therefore, he has nothing to say in regard to the race, tribe, family and character of him who has performed the feat. This hero has won the princess by satisfying the demand of the king Drupada. All his queries have been answered by the stringing of the bow and the shooting down the mark.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>सेयं तथानेन महात्मनेह कृष्णा जिता पार्थिवसङ्घमध्ये। नैवंगते सौमकिरद्य राजा संतापमहत्यसुखाय कर्तुम्॥<br />It is by doing that which he had directed this illustrious hero has won Krishna in the assembly of kings. Under these circumstances, the king of the lunar race should not indulge in any regret which can only make him unhappy.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>कामश्च योऽसौ दुपदस्य राज्ञः स चापि सम्पत्स्यति पार्थिवस्य। मिमामहं ब्राह्मण साधु मन्ये॥<br />The desire that the king Drupada has all along entertained will (surely) be fulfilled, for O Brahmana, I believe this princess in endued with all auspicious marks.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>न तद् धनुर्मन्दबलेन शक्यं मौळ समायोजयितुं तथा हि। न चाकृतास्त्रेण न हीनजेन लक्ष्यं तथा पातयितुं हि शक्यम्॥<br />None that is weak in strength could string that bow and none of low birth or unaccomplished in arms could have shot down the mark.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>तस्मान्न तापं दुहितुर्निमित्तं पाञ्चालराजोऽर्हति कर्तुमद्या न चापि तत्पातनमन्यथेह कर्तुं हि शक्यं भुवि मानवेन॥<br />It is, therefore, not proper for the Panchala king to grieve today for his daughter. There is no man in the world who can (now) undo that act of shooting down the mark.</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>एवं ब्रुवत्येव युधिष्ठिरे तु पाञ्चालराजस्य समीपतोऽन्यः। तत्राजगामाशु नरो द्वितीयो निवेदयिष्यनिह सिद्धमन्नम्॥<br />Vaishampayana said : While Yudhishthira was saying all this, the king of Panchala, another messenger came in haste and said “The feast is ready."</p>
