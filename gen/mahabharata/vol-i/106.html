<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>किं तु मातुः स वैगुण्यादन्ध एव भविष्यति। तस्य तद् वचनं श्रुत्वा माता पुत्रमथाब्रवीत्॥ नान्धः कुरूणां नृपतिरनुरूपस्तपोधन। ज्ञातिवंशस्य गोप्तारं पितॄणां वंशवर्धनम्॥ द्वितीयं कुरुवंशस्य राजानं दातुमर्हसि।<br />"But for the fault of his mother, he will be blind." Having heard these words of his son, the mother said, "O great ascetic, how can one who is blind be a king, worthy of the Kurus? How can one who is blind can protect his relatives and friends and increase the glory of his fathers and continue the dynasty? Therefore, you should give another king to the Kuru race.”</p>

In due time the princess of Kosalya gave birth to a blind son. O chastiser of foes, after securing the consent of her daughter-in-law, Satyavati soon after again summoned Vyasa as she did before. Vyasa came according to his promise and went to the second wife (Ambalika) of his brother in proper form. But she became pale and discoloured with fear on seeing the Rishi.</p>
