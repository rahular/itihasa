<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>तत आहूय मन्त्रज्ञं राजशास्त्रार्थवित्तमम्। कणिकं मन्त्रिणां श्रेष्ठं धृतराष्ट्रोऽब्रवीद् वचः॥<br />Thereupon summoning that best of ministers, Kanika, learned in politics and expert in counsels, Dhritarashtra said-</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच उत्सित्ताः पाण्डवा नित्यं तेभ्योऽसूये द्विजोत्तम। तत्र मे निश्चिततमं संधिविग्रहकारणम्। कणिक त्वं ममाचक्ष्व करिष्ये वचनं तव॥<br />Dhritarashtra said : O best of Brahmanas, the Pandavas are daily over-shadowing the earth. I am very jealous of them. Should I have peace or war with them? O Kanika, advise me truly; I shall do your bidding.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच स प्रसन्नमनास्तेन परिपृष्टो द्विजोत्तमः। उवाच वचनं तीक्ष्णं राजशास्त्रार्थदर्शनम्॥<br />Vaishampayana said : That best of Brahmanas feel answered him in these pointed words, well-agreeing with the import of politics.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>शृणु राजन्निदं तत्र प्रोच्यमानं मयानघ। न मेऽभ्यसूया कर्तव्या श्रुत्वैव कुरुसत्तम।॥<br />Kanika said: O sinless king, listen to me as I answer. O best of the Kurus, you should not be angry with me on hearing what I say.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>नित्यमुद्यतदण्डः स्यान्नित्यं विवृतपौरुषः। अच्छिद्रश्छिद्रदर्शी स्यात् परेषां विवरानुगः॥<br />Kings should ever be ready with upraised scepter (to rule) and they should ever extend their prowess. Carefully avoiding all faults of theirs, they should ceaselessly watch for the faults of others.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>नित्यमुद्यतदण्डाद्धि भृशमुद्विजते जनः। तस्मात् सर्वाणि कार्याणि दण्डेनैव विधारयेत्॥<br />If the king is ever ready with his uplifted scepter, every one fears him. Therefore he should ever have recourse to his scepter (chastisement) in all he does.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>नास्यच्छिद्रं परः पश्येच्छिद्रेण परमन्वियात्। गृहेत् कूर्म इवाङ्गानि रक्षेद् विवरमात्मनः॥ नासम्यक्कृतकारी स्यादुपक्रम्य कदाचन। कण्टको ह्यपि दुश्छिन्न आसावं जनयेच्चिरम्॥<br />He should so act as others (his enemies) may not find any fault in him. But he should see the faults (defects) others. He should keep his resources concealed as does a tortoise his members of body. Having begun a particular act, he should ever completely accomplish it. A thorn, if not wholly extracted, produces a fostering sore.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>वधमेव प्रशंसन्ति शत्रूणामपकारिणाम्। सुविदीर्णं सुविक्रान्तं सुयुद्धं सुपलायितम्॥ आपद्यापदि काले च कुर्वीत न विचारयेत्। नावज्ञेयो रिपुस्तात दुर्बलौऽपि कथंचन।॥<br />The killing of a harmful foe is always praiseworthy. If he be powerful, if he be a great warrior, one should watch for the hour of his disaster and then kill him without any scruple. O son, if the enemy be weak, still he should not be scorned.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>अल्पोऽप्यग्निर्वनं कृत्स्नं दहत्याश्रयसंश्रयात्। अन्धः स्यादन्धवेलायां वाधिर्यमपि चाश्रयेत्॥<br />A spark of fire can consume a forest if it can spread from object to object. They (kings) should sometimes feign deafness and blindness; for if they are incapable of chastising, they should pretend not to notice the faults. They should then consider their bows as made of straw.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>कुर्यात् तृणमयं चापं शयीत मृगशायिकाम्। सान्त्वादिभिरुपायैस्तु हन्याच्छत्रु वशे स्थितम्॥<br />But they should be as watchful as a herd of deer sleeping (in the woods).

<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>दया न तस्मिन् कर्तव्या शरणागत इत्युत्। निरुद्विग्नो हि भवति नहताज्जायते भयम्॥<br />An old enemy should be killed even by winning him over by wealth. Thus you must be free of anxiety, for there is no fear from a dead man.</p>

<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>फलार्थोऽयं समारम्भो लोके पुंसां विपश्चिताम्। वहेदमित्रं स्कन्धेन यावत् कालस्य पर्ययः॥<br />So this method should be adopted in destroying one's own enemies. Carry your enemy on your shoulder till the time comes.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>ततः प्रत्यागते काले भिन्द्याद् घटमिवाश्मनि। अमित्रो न विमोक्तव्यः कृपणं बपि ब्रुवन्॥ कृपा न तस्मिन् कर्तव्या हन्यादेवापकारिणम्। हन्यादमित्रं सान्त्वेन तथा दानेन वा पुनः॥ तथैव भेददण्डाभ्यां सर्वोपायैः प्रशातयेत्।<br />When the times come, you can throw him down and break him into pieces as a earthen vessel is broken being thrown on stones. An enemy should never be allowed to escape, even if he piteously addresses you. You ought not to show him any inercy; he must be slain at once. Enemies should be destroyed by the arts of conciliation or the expenditure of money or by producing disunion amongst his allies or by the employment of every means in your power.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच कथं सान्त्वेन दानेन भेदैर्दण्डेन वा पुनः॥ अमित्रः शक्यते हन्तुं तन्मे ब्रूहि यथातथम्।<br />Dhritarashtra said : Tell me in detail how can a foe be destroyed by the arts of conciliation, or the expenditure of money or by producing disunion or by the employment of force.</p>

He lived in the company of four friends, namely a tiger, a wolf, a mouse and a mongoose. They saw in the woods a strong deer, the leader of a herd, whom however they could not seize for his fleetness and strength. Thereupon they held a consultation.</p>
