<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>महासुरस्यान्ववाये हिरण्यकशिपोः पुरा। निकुम्भो नाम दैत्येन्द्रस्तेजस्वी बलवानभूत्॥<br />In the days of yore there was a Danava chief, named Nikumbha, who was energetic and strong and who was born in the race of Hiranyakashipu.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>तस्य पुत्रौ महावी? जातौ भीमपराक्रमौ। सुन्दोपसुन्दौ दैत्येन्द्रौ दारुणौ क्रूरमानसौ॥<br />Two sons were born to him, named Sunda and Upasunda, both of them being chiefs of the Danavas and both of them being very energetic and powerful, very fearful and wicked-minded.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>तावेकनिश्चयौ दैत्यावेककार्यार्थसम्मतौ। निरन्तरमवर्तेतां समदुःखसुखावुभौ॥<br />Those two Danavas were both of the same resolution and always engaged in performing the same work and in achieving the same end. They were ever the same to each other in weal and in woe.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>विनान्योन्यं न भुञ्जाते विनान्योन्यं न जल्पतः। अन्योन्यस्य प्रियकरावन्योन्यस्य प्रियंवदौ॥<br />Each speaking and doing what was agreeable to each other, the brothers never ate unless they were together and never went anywhere unless together.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>एकशीलसमाचारौ द्विधैवैकोऽभवत् कृतः। तौ विवृद्धौ महावीर्यो कार्येष्वप्येकनिश्चयौ॥<br />Of exactly the same dispositions and habits, they seemed to be one individual divided into two parts. Possessing great energy and the same resolution in every thing, the brothers thus gradually grew up.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>त्रैलोक्यविजयार्थाय समाधायैकनिश्चयम्। दीक्षां कृत्वा गतौ विन्ध्यं तावुनं तेपतुस्तपः॥<br />Always entertaining the same purpose and ever desiring of subjugating the three worlds, the brothers went after due initiation to the mountains of Vindhya; and going there, they performed served penances.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>तौ त दीर्पण कालेन तपोयुक्तौ बभूवतुः। क्षुत्पिपासापरिश्रान्तौ जटावल्कलधारिणौ।<br />Exhausted with hunger and thirst with matted locks on their heads and attired in barks of trees, They performed penances for a very long time till at last they received sufficient ascetic merits.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>मलोपचितसर्वाङ्गौ वायुभक्षौ बभूवतुः। आत्ममांसानि जुह्वन्तौ पादाङ्गुष्ठाग्रविष्ठितौ। ऊर्ध्ववाहू चानिमिषौ दीर्घकालं धृतव्रतौ॥<br />Besmearing themselves with dirts from head to foot, living on air alone and standing on the toes of their own legs, they poured into fire pieces of flesh from their own body. With arms upraised and fixed eyes, they observed their vows for a long period.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>तयोस्तपःप्रभावेण दीर्घकालं प्रतापितः। धूमं प्रमुमुचे विन्ध्यस्तद्भुतमिवाभवत्॥<br />(During the course of their ascetic penances), a wonderful incident happened. The Vindhya mountain, heated by their ascetic penance for many long years, began to emit vapours from every part of its body.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>ततो देवा भयं जग्मुरुयं दृष्ट्वा तयोस्तपः। तपोविधातार्थमथो देवा विनानि चक्रिरे॥<br />Thereupon, seeing their severe penances the celestials were alarmed. The celestials threw many obstacles for impeding their asceticism.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>रत्नैः प्रलोभयामासुः स्त्रीभिश्चोभौ पुनः पुनः। न च तौ चक्रतुर्भङ्गं व्रतस्य सुमहाव्रतौ॥<br />They again and again tempted them with gems and jewels and the most handsome maidens. But those two (brothers), firmly engaged in asceticism, did not break their VOWS,</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>अथ मायां पुनर्देवास्तयोश्चक्रुर्महात्मनोः। भगिन्यो मातरो भार्यास्तयोश्चात्मजनस्तथा।॥ प्रपात्यमाना विस्रस्ताः शूलहस्तेन रक्षसा। भ्रष्टाभरणकेशान्ता भ्रष्टाभरणवाससः॥ अभिभाष्य ततः सर्वास्तौ त्राहीति विचुक्रुशुः। न च तौ चक्रतुर्भङ्गं व्रतस्य सुमहाव्रतौ॥<br />Then the celestials celestials displayed Maya (delusion) before those (two) illustrious Rishis. It appeared to them as if their sisters, mothers, wives and other relatives, with dishevelled hair, ornaments and robes, were running towards them in terror, pursued and struck down by a Rakshasas who had a lance in his hands. It appeared as if they were all crying, "O save us! O save us.” But even this could not break the vows of those two great vowobserving Rishis.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>यदा क्षोभं नोपयाति नार्तिमन्यतरस्तयोः। ततः स्त्रियस्ता भूतं च सर्वमन्तरधीयत॥<br />When all this did not produce any impression on any of the two (Rishis), then the women and all the other apparitions vanished (into space).</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>ततः पितामहः साक्षादभिगम्य महासुरौ। वरेणच्छन्दयामास सर्वलोकहितः प्रभुः॥<br />Thereupon the Grandsire (Brahma) himself came to those two heroes and the Lord who seeks the welfare of all, asked them to solicit the boon they desired,</p>
