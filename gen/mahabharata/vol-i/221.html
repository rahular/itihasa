<h3>HARANA HARANA PARVA: Chapter 221</h3><h4>Birth of Pandu princes</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच उक्तवन्तो यथा वीर्यमसकृत् सर्ववृष्ण्यः। ततोऽब्रवीद् वासुदेवो वाक्यं धर्मार्थसंयुतम्॥<br />Vaishampayana said : When the powerful Vrishnis all began to speak in this strain, then Vasudeva (Krishna) spoke these words of deep import and true morality.</p>
<p id='2'>नावमानं कुलस्यास्य गुडाकेशः प्रयुक्तवान्। सम्मानोऽभ्यधिकस्तेन प्रयुक्तोऽयं न संशयः॥<br />Gudakesha (Arjuna) has not insulted our family by what he has done. There is no doubt he has enhanced our glory.</p>
<p id='3'>अर्थलुब्धान् न वः पार्थो मन्यते सात्वतान् सदा। स्वयंवरमनाधृष्यं मन्यते चापि पाण्डवः॥<br />Partha knows that we are never mercenary. The Pandava (Arjuna) also regards Svyaimvara as doubtful in its results.</p>
<p id='4'>प्रदानमपि कन्यायाः पशुवत् कोऽनुमन्यते। विक्रयं चाप्यपत्यस्य कः कुर्यात् पुरुषो भुवि॥<br />Who also would approved of accepting a bride in gift as if she were an animal? What man again is there on earth who would sell his offsprings?</p>
<p id='5'>एतान् दोषांस्तु कौन्तेयो दृष्टवानिति मे मतिः। अतः प्रसह्य हृतवान् कन्यां धर्मेण पाण्डवः॥<br />I think the son of Kunti (Arjuna) saw these faults in all other methods, therefore the Pandava took the maiden away by force according to ordinance.</p>
<p id='6'>उचितश्चैव सम्बन्धः सुभद्रां च यशस्विनीम्। एष चापीदृशः पार्थः प्रसह्य हृतवानिति॥<br />This alliance is very proper. Subhadra is an illustrious girl and so is Partha. Thinking all this, he has taken her away by force. a</p>
<p id='7'>भरतस्यान्वये जातं शान्तनोश्च यशस्विनः। कुन्तिभोजात्मजापुत्रं को बुभूषेत नार्जुनम्॥<br />Who is there that would not desire to have Arjuna as a friend? He is born in the race of Bharata and the illustrious Shantanu and he is also the son of the daughter of Kuntibhoja.</p>
<p id='8'>न च पश्यामि यः पार्थं विजयेत रणे बलात्। वर्जयित्वा विरूपाक्षं भगनेत्रहरं हरम्॥ अपि सर्वेषु लोकेषु सेन्द्ररुद्रेषु मारिष। स च नाम रथस्तादृङ्मदीयास्ते च वाजिनः॥ योद्धा पार्थश्च शीघ्रास्त्रः को नु तेन समो भवेत्। तमभिद्रुत्य सान्त्वेन परमेण धनंजयम्॥ न्यवर्तयत् संहृष्टा ममैषा परमा मतिः।<br />I do not see such a man in all the worlds, even with Indra and the Rudras, who can vanquish him in battle except the three eyed deity Shiva. His car is well known; my steeds are now yoked to it. Partha as a warrior is also well known and his lightness of hand too is well known. Who shall be equal to him? Go cheerfully to Dhananjaya; stop him by conciliation and bring him back. This is my opinion.</p>
<p id='9'>यदि निर्जित्य वः पार्थो बलाद् गच्छेत् स्वकं पुरम्।।११ प्रणश्येद् वो यशः सद्यो न तु सान्त्वे पराजयः।<br />If Partha goes away to his city (Indraprastha) by defeating us, our fame will be destroyed. But there is no disgrace in conciliation.</p>
<p id='10'>तच्छ्रुत्वा वासुदेवस्य तथा चक्रुर्जनाधिप॥<br />O king, having heard these words of Vasudeva, they did as he directed.</p>
<p id='11'>निवृत्तश्चार्जुनस्तत्र विवाहं कृतवान् प्रभुः। उषित्वा तत्र कौन्तेयः संवत्सरपराः क्षपाः॥<br />Stopped by them, the lord Arjuna returned to Dvarka and he was then united with Subhadra in marriage.</p>
<p id='12'>विहत्य च यथाकामं पूजितो वृष्णिनन्दनैः। पुष्करे तु ततः शेषं कालं वर्तितवान् प्रभुः॥ पूर्णे तु द्वादशे वर्षे खाण्डवप्रस्थमागतः।<br />Having worshipped by the Vrishnis, the son of Kunti remained for a year in Dvarka, sporting there at pleasure. The lord (Arjuna) passed the last portion of his excite at Pushkara. When twelve years were thus complete, he came back of Khandavaprastha.</p>
<p id='13'>अभिगम्य च राजानं नियमेन समाहितः॥ अभ्यर्च्य ब्राह्मणान् पार्थो द्रौपदीमभिजग्मिवान्।<br />He went to Yudhishthira and worshipped him first; he then worshipped the Brahmanas and at last he went to Draupadi.</p>
<p id='14'>तं द्रौपदी प्रत्युवाच प्रणयात् कुरुनन्दनम्॥ तत्रैव गच्छ कौन्तेय यत्र सा सात्वतात्मजा।<br />Draupadi, out of jealousy, thus spoke to that descendant of Kuru, Arjuna, “O son of Kunti, go there where the daughter of the Satvata race is.</p>
<p id='15'>सुबद्धस्यापि भारस्य पूर्वबन्धः श्लथायते॥ तथा बहुविधं कृष्णां विलपन्ती धनंजयः सान्त्वयामास भूयश्च क्षमयामास चासकृत्॥ सुभद्रां त्वरमाणश्च रक्तकौशेयवासिनीम्। पार्थः प्रस्थापयामास कृत्वा गोपालिकावपुः॥ साधिकं तेन रूपेण शोभमाना यशस्विनी।<br />A second always relaxes the first one, however strong it might be.” Thus Krishna (Draupadi) lamented in various strains and Dhananjaya (Arjuna) comforted her, asking again and again her forgiveness. Coming to Subhadra attired in red silk, Partha sent her (into the inner apartments) dressed in the grab of a cow-herd women. The illustrious lady looked handsome even in that dress.</p>
<p id='16'>भवनं श्रेष्ठमासाद्य वीरपत्नी वराङ्गना।॥ ववन्दे पृथुताम्राक्षी पृथां भद्रा यशस्विनी।<br />Arriving at that best of houses, that wife of a hero, the best of women, the illustrious Bhadra (Subhadra) of large and radish eyes worshipped Pritha.</p>
<p id='17'>तां कुन्ती चारुसर्वाङ्गीमुपाजिघ्रत मूर्धनि॥ प्रीत्या परमया युक्ता आशीर्भिर्युञ्जतातुलाम्।<br />Out of excessive affection Kunti sinelt the head of that maiden of perfectly charming features and she then pronounced infinite blessings upon her.</p>
<p id='18'>ततोऽभिगम्य त्वरिता पूर्णेन्दुसदृशानना॥ ववन्दे द्रौपदी भद्रा प्रेष्याहमिति चाब्रवीत्।<br />Then that damsel of the face like the full moon, Bhadra, soon went to Draupadi and worshipped her saying, "I am your maid."</p>
<p id='19'>प्रत्युत्थाय तदा कृष्णा स्वसारं माधवस्य च॥ परिष्वज्यावदत् प्रीत्या निःसपत्नोऽस्तु ते पतिः।<br />Krishna hastily rose and embraced the sister of Madhava; and out of affection she then said, “Let you husband be without a rival."</p>
<p id='20'>तथैव मुदिता भद्रा तामुवाचैवमस्त्विति॥ ततस्ते हृष्टमनसः पाण्डवेया महारथाः। कुन्ती च परमप्रीता बभूव जनमेजय॥ श्रुत्वा तु पुण्डरीकाक्षः सम्प्राप्तं स्वं पुरोत्तमम्। अर्जुनं पाण्डवश्रेष्ठमिन्द्रप्रस्थगतं तदा॥ आजगाम विशुद्धात्मा सह रामेण केशवः।<br />Bhadra then with a delightful heart said to her, “But it so." O Janamejaya, from that time, those great car-warriors the Pandavas, lived happily and Kunti also became vary happy. Having heard that the best of the Pandavas Arjuna, had reached that excellent city, Indraprastha, the lotus-eyed and pure-souled Keshava (Krishna) came there with Rama (Baladeva),</p>
