<p id='12'>वैशम्पायन उवाच द्रुपदेनैवमुक्तस्तु भारद्वाजः प्रतापवान्। मुहूर्तं चिन्तयित्वा तु मन्युनाभिपरिप्लुतः॥ स विनिश्चित्य मनसा पाञ्चालं प्रति बुद्धिमान्। जगाम कुरुमुख्यानां नगरं नागसाह्वयम्॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Thus addressed by Drupada, the powerful son of Bharadvaja, was filled with anger and reflecting for a moment. That wise man made up his mind as to his course of action with regard to the king of Panchala, He then went to the city of the foremost of the Kurus, named Hastinapur.</p>
<p id='13'>स नागपुरमागम्य गौतमस्य निवेशने। भारद्वाजोऽवसत् तत्र प्रच्छन्नं द्विजसत्तमः॥<br />Arrived at Hastinapur, the excellent Brahmana, the son of Bharadvaja, (Drona) lived in privacy in the house of the son of Gautama (Kripa).</p>
<p id='14'>ततोऽस्य तनुजः पार्थान् कृपस्यानन्तरं प्रभुः। अस्त्राणि शिक्षयामास नाबुध्यन्त च तं जनाः॥<br />His lordly son, at the intervals of Kripa's teachings, gave instructions to the sons of Pritha (Pandavas) on the use of arms. But none knew as yet Ashvathama's (real) prowess.</p>
<p id='15'>एवं स तत्र गूढात्मा कंचित् कालमुवास हा कुमारास्त्वथ निष्क्रम्य समेता गजसाह्वयात्॥ क्रीडन्तो वीटया तत्र वीराः पर्यचरन् मुदा। पपात कूपे सा वीटा तेषां वै क्रीडतां तदा।॥<br />Thus he (Drona) lived there in privacy for sometime, when one day the (Kuru) princes all in a company came out of the city of Hastinapur. The princes began to play with a ball and when they were thus there playing, the ball fell into a well.</p>
<p id='16'>ततस्ते यत्नमातिष्ठन् वीटामुद्धर्तुमादृताः। न च ते प्रत्यपद्यन्त कर्म वीटोपलब्धये॥<br />Thereupon, they tried their utmost to recover the ball (from the well). But with all their efforts they could not get up the ball.</p>
<p id='17'>ततोऽन्योन्यमवैक्षन्त व्रीडयावनताननाः। तस्या योगमविन्दन्तो भृशं चोत्कण्द्दिताभवन्॥<br />Then they stared at one another, their faces flushed with blushes of shame. They were filled with great anxiety finding no means of recovering it.</p>
<p id='18'>तेऽपश्यन् ब्राह्मणं श्याममापन्नं पलितं कृशम्। कृत्यवन्तमदूरस्थमग्निहोत्रपुरस्कृतम्॥<br />They then saw near them a Brahmana of darkish colour, decrepit and lean, one who had performed his Sandhya and purified himself with Agnihotra.</p>
<p id='19'>ते तं दृष्ट्वा महात्मानमुपगम्य कुमारकाः। भग्नोत्साहक्रियात्मानो ब्राह्मणं पर्यवारयन्॥<br />Seeing that illustrious (Brahmana), the princes, who were despaired of the ball, immediately surrounded him.</p>

<p id='22'>वीटां च मुद्रिकां चैव ह्यहमेतदपि द्वयम्। उद्धरेयमिषीकाभिर्भोजनं मे प्रदीयताम्॥<br />"If you give me a dinner, I shall with these blades of glass bring up not only the ball you have lost, but also this ring which I now throw down."</p>
<p id='23'>एवमुक्त्वा कुमारांस्तान् द्रोण: स्वाङ्गुलिवेष्टनम्। कूपे निरुदके तमिन्नपातयदरिंदमः॥ ततोऽब्रवीत् तदा द्रोणं कुन्तीपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरः।<br />Having said this, that chastiser of foes, Drona took off his ring and threw it into that dry well.

<p id='25'>द्रोण उवाच एषा मुष्टिरिषीकाणां मयास्त्रेणाभिमन्त्रिता।॥ अस्या वीर्यं निरीक्षध्वं यदन्यस्य न विद्यते। भेत्स्यामीषीकया वीटां तामिषीकां तथान्यया।॥ तामन्यया समायोगे वीटाया ग्रहणं मम।<br />Drona said: I shall by my Mantras invest this handful of Ishikas (long glass) with the virtue of weapons. Behold their virtues that no other weapons possess. I shall piece the ball with one of these blades and then pierce that blade with another and that another with a third and thus making a chain, I shall bring it up.</p>
<p id='26'>वैशम्पायन उवाच ततो यथोक्तं द्रोणेन तत् सर्वं कृतमञ्जसा॥ तदवेक्ष्य कुमारास्ते विस्मयोत्फुल्ललोचनाः। आश्चर्यमिदमत्यन्तमिति मत्वा वचोऽब्रुवन्॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Then Drona did exactly what he had said. The princes were all amazed and their eyes expanded with delight. Regarding what they saw as very extraordinary, they said-</p>
<p id='27'>कुमारा ऊचुः मुद्रिकामपि विप्रर्षे शीघ्रमेतां समुद्धर।<br />The princes said : "O best of the twice born, raise up the ring without delay.</p>
<p id='28'>वैशम्पायन उवाच ततः शरं समादाय धनुर्दोणो महायशाः॥ शरेण विद्ध्वा मुद्रां तामूर्ध्वमावाहयत् प्रभुः। सशरं समुपादाय कूपादङ्गुलिवेष्टनम्॥ ददौ ततः कुमाराणां विस्मितानामविस्मितः। मुद्रिकामुद्भूतां दृष्ट्वा तमाहुस्ते कुमारकाः॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Then the greatly illustrious Drona, taking a bow with an arrow pierced the ring with it and brought it up. Raising up from the well that ring, pierced with the arrow, he gave it to the astonished princes. Then princes too, seeing the ring thus recovered, said-</p>
<p id='29'>कुमारा ऊचु: अभिवादयामहे ब्रह्मन् नैतदन्येषु विद्यते। कोऽसि कस्यासि जानीमो वयं किं करवामहे॥<br />The princes said : O Brahmana, we bow to you. No one else possesses such skill. We early desire to know who you are and what we can do for you."</p>
<p id='30'>वैशम्पायन उवाच एवमुक्तस्ततो द्रोणः प्रत्युवाच कुमारकान्।<br />Having been thus addressed, Drona spoke thus to the princes.</p>
<p id='31'>द्रोण उवाच आचक्षध्वं च भीष्माय रूपेण च गुणैश्च माम्॥ स एव सुमहातेजाः साम्प्रतं प्रतिपत्स्यते।<br />Drona said : Go to Bhishma and describe to him my likeness and skill. That greatly powerful man will be able to recognise me.</p>
<p id='32'>वैशम्पायन उवाच तथेत्युक्त्वा च गत्वा च भीष्ममूचुः कुमारकाः॥ ब्राह्मणस्य वचस्तथ्यं तच्च कर्म तथाविधम्। भीष्मः श्रुत्वा कुमाराणां द्रोणं तं प्रत्यजानत॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Saying "Be it so," the princes went to Bhishma and told him all that the Brahmana had said and done. Hearing from the princes everything, Bhishma (at once) recognised Drona and thought that he would be the best preceptor (for the princes.)</p>
<p id='33'>युक्तरूपः स हि गुरुरित्येवमनुचिन्त्य च। अथैनमानीय तदा स्वयमेव सुसत्कृतम्॥ परिपप्रच्छ निपुणं भीष्मः शस्त्रभृतां वरः। हेतुमागमने तच्च द्रोणः सर्वं न्यवेदयत्॥<br />That foremost of all wielders of weapons, Bhishma, went to him in person and welcoming him respectfully, brought him over to the palace and asked him the reason of his arrival. Thereupon Drona told him all.</p>
<p id='34'>द्रोण उवाच महर्षेरग्निवेशस्य सकाशमहमच्युत। अस्त्रार्थमगमं पूर्वं धनुर्वेदजिघृक्षया॥<br />Drona said: Being desirous of learning the science of arms, I formerly went to the great Rishi Agnivesha for obtaining weapons from him.</p>
<p id='35'>ब्रह्मचारी विनीतात्मा जटिलो बहुलः समाः। अवसं सुचिरं तत्र गुरुशुश्रूषणे रतः॥<br />I was engaged there in serving my preceptor and lived (with him) for a long time as an humble minded Brahmachari with matted locks on my head.</p>
<p id='36'>पाञ्चालो राजपुत्रश्च यज्ञसेनो महाबलः। इष्वस्त्रहेतोय॑वसत् तस्मिन्नेव गुरौ प्रभुः॥<br />The prince of Panchala, the greatly powerful Yajnasena also lived there with the same motive (as that of mine).</p>
<p id='37'>स मे तत्र सखा चासीदुपकारी प्रियश्च मे। तेनाहं सह संगम्य वर्तयन् सुचिरं प्रभो॥<br />There he became my friend and he always sought my welfare. He was beloved to me. O lord, he lived with me for many years.</p>
<p id='38'>बाल्यात् प्रभृति कौरव्य सहाध्ययनमेव च। स मे सख्या सदा तत्र प्रियवादी प्रियंकरः॥<br />O descendant of Kuru, we had studied together from our earliest days; he was my friend from boyhood; he always spoke and did what was agreeable to me.</p>
<p id='39'>अब्रवीदिति मां भीष्म वचनं प्रीतिवर्धनम्। अहं प्रियतमः पुत्रः पितुर्दोण महात्मनः॥<br />O Bhishma he used to tell me these gratifying words, “O Drona, I am the favourite son of my illustrious father.</p>
<p id='40'>अभिषेक्ष्यति मां राज्ये स पाञ्चालो यदा तदा। त्वद्भोग्यं भविता तात सखे सत्येन ते शपे॥ अलभद् गौतमी मम भोगाश्च वित्तं च त्वदधीनं सुखानि च। एवमुक्त्वाथ वव्राज कृतास्त्रः पूजितो मया॥<br />When my father (the king) would install me as the ruler of the Panchalas, it (the kingdom) shall be then enjoyed by you. O friend, this is my solemn promise. My kingdom, my wealth, my happiness all will be at your disposal.” When his study of the science of arms was finished he went away after being duly worshipped by me.</p>
<p id='41'>तच्च वाक्यमहं नित्यं मनसा धारयंस्तदा। सोऽहं पितृनियोगेन पुत्रलोभाद् यशस्विनीम्॥ नातिकेशी महाप्रज्ञामुपयेमे महाव्रताम्। अग्निहोत्रे च सत्रे च दमे च सततं रताम्॥ पुत्रमश्वत्थामानमौरसम्। भीमविक्रमकर्माणमादित्यसमतेजसम्॥<br />I kept his words always in my mind. Some time after, in obedience to the injunction of my father and in the temptation of begetting offspring, I married the illustrious daughter of Gautama (Kripi) who had sort hair, who possessed great intelligence and observed many rigid vows and who was ever engaged in the Agnihotra, sacrifices and austerities. She gave birth to a son, named Ashvathama, who was greatly powerful and as the sun.</p>
<p id='42'>पुत्रेण तेन प्रीतोऽहं भरद्वाजो मया यथा। गोक्षीरं पिबतो दृष्ट्वा धनिनस्तत्र पुत्रकान्। अश्वत्थामारुदद् बालस्तन्मे संदेहयद् दिशः॥<br />As Bharadvaja, was pleased on obtaining me, so I was pleased to getting that son. One day Ashvathama began to cry on seeing some rich men's sons drink milk. I was so beside myself at this that I lost all knowledge of the points of heaven.</p>
<p id='43'>न स्नातकोऽवसीदेत वर्तमानः स्वकर्मसु। इति संचिन्त्य मनसा तं देशं बहुशो भ्रमन्॥ विशुद्धमिच्छन् गाङ्गेय धपितं प्रतिग्रहम्। अन्तादन्तं परिक्रम्य नाध्यगच्छं पयस्विनीम्॥<br />"Instead of asking him who had only a few kine, just sufficient for sacrificial proposes, I shall ask him who had many,” thinking thus in my mind, O son of Ganga, I roamed over many countries.</p>
<p id='44'>अथ पिष्टोदकेनैनं लोभयन्ति कुमारकाः। पीत्वा पिष्टरसं बालः क्षीरं पीतं मयापि च॥ ननर्वोत्थाय कौरव्य हृष्टो बाल्याद् विमोहितः। तं दृष्ट्वा नृत्यमानं तु बालैः परिवृतं सुतम्॥ हास्यतामुपसम्प्राप्तं कश्मलं तत्र मेऽभवत्। द्रोणं धिगस्त्वधनिनं यो धनं नाधिगच्छति॥<br />Through I roved all over the country, yet I could not obtain a milch-cow and I returned unsuccessful. Thereupon some boys tempted him with Pistaudaka (water mixed with powdered rice). The child, drinking the Pistaudaka cried out, "O I have drunk milk.” O descendant of Kuru, he began to dance in joy, being thus decided by his childish ignorance. Seeing him dance with joy amidst his playmates who were smiling at his simplicity, I was exceedingly touched. “Fie to the poor Drona, who does not try to earn wealth!</p>
<p id='45'>पिष्टोदकं सुतो यस्य पीत्वा क्षीरस्य तृष्णया। नृत्यति स्म मुदाविष्टः क्षीरं पीतं मयाप्युत॥ इति सम्भाषतां वाचं श्रुत्वा मे बुद्धिरच्यवत्। आत्मानं चात्मना गर्हन् मनसेदं व्यचिन्तयम्॥ अपि चाहं पुरा विप्रैर्वर्जितो गर्हितो वसे। परोपसेवां पापिष्ठां न च कुर्यां धनेप्सया॥<br />His son in the thirst for milk drinks Pistaudaka; in ignorance he dances, crying “I have drunk milk.” Hearing these derisive words, I was quite beside myself! Then reproaching myself by myself, I began to reflect thus in my mind, "Cast off and censured by Brahmanas, I would not yet, from the desire of wealth, be any body's servant, which is ever sinful."</p>
<p id='46'>इति मत्वा प्रियं पुत्रं भीष्मादाय ततो ह्यहम्। पूर्वस्नेहानुरागित्वात् सदारः सौमकिं गतः॥<br />O Bhishma, thus resolved and remembering my former friendship for him (Drupada) I regarded myself very much blessed. I went joyfully to the Saumaka, taking my beloved son and wife with me.</p>
<p id='47'>अभिषिक्तं तु श्रुत्वैव कृतार्थोऽस्मीति चिन्तयन्। प्रियं सखायं सुप्रीतो राज्यस्थं समुपागमम्॥<br />I joyfully heard that my beloved friend had been installed on the throne and remembered his words and companionship. O lord, I went to Drupada</p>
<p id='48'>संस्मरन् संगमं चैव वचनं चैव तस्य तत्। ततो दुपदमागम्य सखिपूर्वमहं प्रभो॥ अब्रुवं पुरुषव्याघ्र सखायं विद्धि मामिति। उपस्थितस्तु द्रुपदं सखिवच्चास्मि संगतः॥<br />Remembering my old friendship and said to him "O best of men, know me as your friend." I went to Drupada confidently as a friend should do.</p>
<p id='49'>स मां निराकारमिव प्रहसन्निदमब्रवीत्। अकृतेयं तव प्रज्ञा ब्रह्मन् नातिसमञ्जसा॥ यदात्थ मां त्वं प्रसभं सखा तेऽहमिति द्विज। संगतानीह जीर्यन्ति कालेन परिजीर्यतः॥<br />But Drupada, laughing in derision, cast me off as if I were a vulgar fellow; and he said, “O Brahmana, your intelligence is hardly of high order. As coming to me on a sudden you say are my friend. O dull-minded man, great kings can never be friends with such luckless and indigent fellow like you.</p>
<p id='50'>सौहृदं मे त्वया ह्यासीत् पूर्वं सामर्थ्यबन्धनम्। नाश्रोत्रियः श्रोत्रियस्य नारथी रथिनः सखा॥<br />We had friendship between us when we were both equally circumstance, but Time that wears out everything, wears out friendship also.</p>
<p id='51'>साम्याद्धि सख्यं भवति वैषम्यान्नोपपद्यते। न सख्यमजरं लोके विद्यते जातु कस्यचित्॥<br />Friendship never remains in the world in any one's heart without being worn out. Time wears it out and anger also destroys it.</p>
<p id='52'>कालो वैनं विहरति क्रोधो वैनं हरत्युत। मैवं जीर्णमुपास्स्व त्वं सत्यं भवत्वपाकृधि॥<br />Do not, therefore, stick to that worn-out friendship. Do not think of it any longer. O best of Brahmanas, the friendship I entertained for you was for a particular.</p>
<p id='53'>आसीत् सख्यं द्विजश्रेष्ठत्वया मेऽर्थनिबन्धनम्। न ह्यनादयः सखान्यस्य नाविद्वान् विदुषः सखा॥६९ न शूरस्य सखा क्लीवः सखिपूर्वं किमिष्यते। न हि राज्ञामुदीर्णानामेवम्भूतैर्नरैः क्वचित्॥ सख्यं भवति मन्दात्मन् श्रियाहीनैर्धनच्युतैः। नाश्रोत्रियः श्रोत्रियस्य नारथी रथिनः सखा॥ नाराजा पार्थिवस्यापि सखिपूर्वं किमिष्यते। अहं त्वया न जानामि राज्यार्थे संविदं कृताम्॥<br />The poor cannot be the friend of the rich; the unlearned can not be the friend of the learned; the coward cannot be the friend of the brave (heroes). How them do you desire the continuance of our old friendship? There may be either friendship or enmity between two persons equally situated as to wealth or prowess. The poor and the rich can neither be friends nor enemies of one another. One of pure birth can never be a friend of one who is lowly born, a car warrior can be a friend of one who is not a car-warrior; one who is not a king cannot have a king for his friend. I do not know you, I do not remember that I ever promised you my kingdom.</p>
<p id='54'>एकरात्रं तु ते ब्रह्मन् कामं दास्यामि भोजनम्। एवमुक्तस्त्वहं तेन सदारः प्रस्थितस्तदा॥ तां प्रतिज्ञा प्रतिज्ञाय यां कर्तास्म्यचिरादिव। दुपदेनैवमुक्तोऽहं मन्युनाभिपरिप्लुतः॥<br />O Brahmana, I can give you food and shelter for one night.” Having been thus addressed, I left his presence with my wife, vowing to do that which I shall certainly do without much delay. O Bhishma, thus insulted by Drupada I was filled with wrath.</p>
<p id='55'>अभ्यागच्छं कुरून् भीष्म शिष्यैरर्थी गुणान्वितैः। ततोऽहं भवतः कामं संवर्धयितुमागतः॥ इदं नागपुरं रम्यं ब्रूहि किं करवाणि ते।<br />I have come to the Kurus wishing to obtain accomplished pupils. To act according to your wishes, I now come to Hastinapur. Tell me what I am to do.</p>
<p id='56'>वैशम्पायन उवाच एवमुक्तस्तदा भीष्मो भारद्वाजमभाषत॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Having been thus addressed, Bhishma thus spoke to the son of Bharadvaja.</p>
<p id='57'>भीष्म उवाच अपज्यं क्रियतां चापं साध्वस्त्रं प्रतिपादय। भुक्ष्व भोगान् भृशं प्रीतः पूज्यमानः कुरुक्षये॥<br />Bhishma said: Unstring your bow and teach (these prices) the science of arms. Enjoy joyfully as much as you like every luxury in the Kuru abode.</p>
<p id='58'>कुरूणामस्ति यद् वित्तं राज्यं चेदं सराष्ट्रकम्। त्वमेव परमो राजा सर्वे च कुरवस्तव॥<br />Whatever wealth, kingdom and sovereignty the Kurus posses, you are the lord of all. All the Kurus are at your command.</p>
<p id='59'>यच्च ते प्रार्थितं ब्रह्मन् कृतं तदिति चिन्त्यताम्। दिष्ट्या प्राप्तोऽसि विप्रर्षे महान् मेऽनुग्रहः कृतः॥<br />O Brahmana, consider that to be already accomplished which is in your heart. O best of the twice born, as the fruit of our good luck we have obtained you.</p>
