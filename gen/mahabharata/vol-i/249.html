<h3>None: Chapter 15</h3><h4>continued Words of Srikrishna</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच उक्तं त्वया बुद्धिमता यन्नान्यो वक्तुमर्हति। संशयानां हि निर्मोक्ता त्वन्नान्यो विद्यते भुवि॥<br />Yudhishthira said Intelligent as you are, you have said what none else is capable of saying. There is none else in the world but you who can settle all doubts.</p>
<p id='2'>गृहे गृहे हि राजानः स्वस्य स्वस्य प्रियंकराः। न च साम्राज्यमाप्तास्ते सम्राट्छन्दो हि कृच्छ्रभाक्॥<br />There are kings in every province engaged in doing good to their respective selves. But none of them has been able to become an Emperor. The title of Emperor is difficult to be achieved.</p>
<p id='3'>कथं परानुभावज्ञः स्वं प्रशंसितुमर्हति। परेण समवेतस्तु यः प्रशस्यः स पूज्यते॥<br />He who knows the velour and the strength of others never applauds himself. He is really worthy of praise who even in fighting with his enemies bear himself with all commendation.</p>
<p id='4'>विशाला बहुला भूमिर्बहुरत्नसमाचिता। दूरं गत्वा विजानाति श्रेयो वृष्णिकुलोद्वह॥<br />O supporter of the Vrishni dignity, man's desires and propensities are varied and extensive like the wide earth adorned with various gems and jewels. As by travelling in distant places experiences is gained, so man can get the highest good by the highest culture of his understanding.</p>
<p id='5'>शममेव परं मन्ये शमात् क्षेमं भवेन्मम। आरम्भे पारमेष्ठ्ये तु न प्राप्यमिति मे मतिः॥<br />I consider peace of mind as the highest quality, for from peace of mind proceeds prosperity. In my opinion, if I undertake to perform this sacrifice, I shall not win the highest reward.</p>
<p id='6'>एवमेते हि जानन्ति कुले जाता मनस्विनः। कश्चित् कदाचिदेतेषां भवेच्छ्रेष्ठो जनार्दन॥<br />O Janardana, these intelligent and powerful men born in our race think that one amongst them will at one time become the foremost man amongst all the Kshatriyas.</p>
<p id='7'>वयं चैव महाभाग जरासंधभयात् तदा। शङ्किताः स्म महाभाग दौरात्म्यात् तस्य चानघ॥ अहं हि तव दुर्द्धर्ष भुजवीर्याश्रयः प्रभो। नात्मानं बलिनं मन्ये त्वयि तस्माद् विशङ्किते॥<br />But, O exalted one, O sinless being, we also were all alarmed at the prowess and the wickedness of the king Jarasandha, O hero, invincible in battle, O lord, the prowess of your arms in our refuge. When you are alarıned at Jarasandha's might, how should I consider my self strong (enough to cope with him)?</p>
<p id='8'>त्वत्सकाशाच्च रामाच्च भीमसेनाच्च माधव। अर्जुनाद् वा महाबाहो हन्तुं शक्यो न वेति वै। एवं जानन् हि वार्ष्णेय विमृशामि पुनः पुनः॥ त्वं मे प्रमाणभूतोऽसि सर्वकार्येषु केशव। तच्छ्रुत्वा चाब्रवीद् भीमो वाक्यं वाक्यविशारदः॥<br />O Madhava, O descendant of the Vrishni race, I have often become dispersed at the thought whether Jarasandha is at all capable of being killed by you, by Rama, or by Arjuna. O Keshava, what shall I say? You are my highest authority in everything. Having heard this, the able speaker Bhima then spoke these words:</p>
<p id='9'>भीम उवाच अनारम्भपरो राजा वल्मीक इव सीदति। दुर्बलश्चानुपायेन बलिनं योऽधितिष्ठति॥<br />Bhima said The king, who is without any exertion, or the king who being himself weak and without resources, enter into hostility with one who is strong, perishes like an anthill.</p>
<p id='10'>अतन्द्रितश्च प्रायेण दुर्बलो बलिनं रिपुम्। जयेत् सम्यक् प्रयोगेण नीत्यार्थानात्मनो हितान्॥<br />It is often seen that even weak king may defeat a strong enemy; and he may be come successful in his attempts by his wakefulness and by using policy.</p>
<p id='11'>कृष्णे नयो मयि बलं जयः पार्थे धनञ्जये। मागधं साधयिष्याम इष्टिं त्रय इवाग्नयः॥<br />(We have) in Krishna policy, in me strength, and in Partha (Dhananjaya) victory. Like the three (sacrificial) fires, we shall bring about the death of the king of Magadha (Jarasandha)</p>
<p id='12'>कृष्ण उवाच अर्थानारभते बालो नानुबन्धमवेक्षते। तस्मादरिं न मृष्यन्ति बालमर्थपरायणम्॥<br />Krishna said Men of immature understanding begin an act without having an eye to what may happen in future. It is, therefore, not a self-seeking enemy with immature understanding is ever forgiven by a sensible man.</p>
<p id='13'>जित्वा जय्यान् यौवनाश्विः पालनाच्च भगीरथः। कार्तवीर्यस्तपोवीर्याद् बलात्तु भरतो विभुः॥ ऋद्ध्या मरुत्तस्तान् पञ्च सम्राजस्त्वनुशुश्रुम। साम्राज्यमिच्छतस्ते तु सर्वाकारं युधिष्ठिर।॥ निग्राह्यलक्षणं प्राप्तिर्धर्मार्थनयलक्षणैः॥<br />It has been heard by us that in the Satya Yuga, Yuvanashva brought every one under his sway, by the remission of taxes, Bhagiratha by kind treatment of his subjects, Kartavirya by his great asceticism, the lord Bharata by his extra ordinary prowess and Maruta by his prosperity, and thus they became emperors. O Yudhishthira, you who wish to acquire the imperial dignity, have the above mentioned) five qualities.</p>
<p id='14'>बार्हद्रथो जरासंधस्तद् विद्धि भरतर्षभ। न चैनमनुरुद्ध्यन्ते कुलान्येकशतं नृपाः। तस्मादिह बलादेव साम्राज्यं कुरुते हि सः॥<br />O best of the Bharata race, the son of Brihadratha, Jarasandha, is (also) one such (a candidate for the imperial dignity). One hundred families of kings have failed to oppose him.</p>
<p id='15'>रत्नभाजो हि राजानो जरासंधमुपासते। न च तुष्यति तेनापि वाल्यादनयमास्थितः॥<br />He is ruling over an empire by his own great prowess. The monarchs that wear jewels wait upon and worship Jarasandha. Wicked from his childhood, he is not satisfied even such worship.</p>
<p id='16'>मूर्धाभिषिक्तं नृपतिं प्रधानपुरुषो बलात्। आदत्ते न च नो हृष्टोऽभागः पुरुषतः क्वचित्॥<br />Having become the foremost of all be attacks with force the kings that wear crowns. There is not to be found a single king who does not pay tributes to him.</p>
<p id='17'>एवं सर्वान् वशे चक्रे जरासंधः शतावरान्। तं दुर्बलतरो राजा कथं पार्थ उपैष्यति॥<br />O son of Pritha, thus has be brought under his sway one hundred kings. How can then a weak king approach him with hostile intentions?</p>
<p id='18'>प्रोक्षितानां प्रमृष्टानां राज्ञां पशुपतेर्गृहे। पशूनामिव का प्रीतिर्जीविते भरतर्षभ॥<br />O best of the Bharata race, kept as they are prisoners in the temple of Shiva like so many animals to be offered to the sacrifice, do not these kings feel the greatest possible misery?</p>
<p id='19'>क्षत्रियः शस्त्रस्मरणो यदा भवति सत्कृतः। ततः स्म मागधं संख्ये प्रतिबाधेम यद् वयम्॥<br />A Kshatriya who is killed by weapons (on the field of battle) is ever considered to be blessed. Why shall we not then assemble together and oppose the king of Magadha?</p>
<p id='20'>षडशीतिः समानीताः शेषा राजश्चतुर्दश। जरासंधेन राजानस्ततः क्रूरं प्रवय॑ते॥<br />He has already brought under his sway eighty-six kings, only fourteen (more) are wanted to make the number of one hundred complete. As soon as he will collect them (the fourteen others), he will begin his cruel act(sacrificing them before Shiva).</p>
<p id='21'>प्राप्नुयात् स यशो दीप्तं तत्र यो विघ्नमाचरेत्। जयेद् यश्च जरासंधं स सम्रानियतं भवेत्॥<br />He, who will be able to prevent him from doing this act, will surely earn blazing fame. He, who will defeat Jarasandha, will certainly become the emperor of all the world.</p>
