Agni said in anger, “What do you mean, Brahmana, by this rashness that you have shown towards me.”</p>

The Devas have equal rights with the Pitris to perform the sacrifices, called Darsha and Paurnamasa. Darsha and Paurnamasa yajnas are performed for both Devas and Pitris.</p>
<p id='9'>देवताः पितरस्तस्मात्पितरश्चापि देवताः। एकीभूताश्च पूज्यन्ते पृथक्त्वेन च पर्वसु॥<br />Therefore the Devas are the Pitris and the Pitris are the Devas. They are worshipped as identical beings and they are also separately worshipped at Parvas (changes of the moon).</p>

<p id='11'>अमावास्यां हि पितरः पौर्णमास्यां हि देवताः। मन्मुखेनैव हूयन्ते भुञ्जते च हुतं हविः॥ सर्वभक्षः कथं त्वेषां भविष्यामि मुखं त्वहम्।<br />At the new-moon the Pitris and at the fullmoon the Devas are fed through my mouth with the oblations are offered unto me.

(he withdrew himself) from the Agnihotra of the twice-born, yajnas, satras and from other ceremonies.</p>

<p id='14'>अथर्षयः समुद्विग्ना देवान्गत्वाब्रुवन्वचः। अग्निनाशाक्रियाभ्रंशाभ्रान्ता लोकास्त्रयोऽनघाः।। विधद्ध्वमत्र तत्कार्यं न स्यात्कालात्ययो यथा। अथर्षयश्च देवाश्च ब्रह्माणमुपगम्य तु॥<br />Thereupon the Rishis went to the celestials in great anxiety and addressed them thus, "O immaculate beings, the three worlds have been confounded at the cessation of their sacrifices and ceremonies for the loss of fire. Therefore, be pleased to do the needful. There should not be any loss of time.” Their celestials and the Rishis together having approached the great Brahma,</p>

<p id='22'>यथा सूर्यांशुभिः स्पृष्टं सर्वं शुचि विभाव्यते। तथा त्वदर्चिनिर्दग्धं सर्वं शुचि भविष्यति॥ त्वमग्ने परमं तेजः स्वप्रभावाद्विनिर्गतम्। स्वतेजसैव तं शापं कुरु सत्यमृषेविभो। देवानां चात्मनो भागं गृहाण त्वं मुखे हुतम्॥<br />As all thing become pure, touched by the sunbeams, so will everything be pure that will be burnt in your flames. O Agni, you are the supreme energy, born of your own power. By that power, make the Rishi's curse true. Continue to receive your portion and that of the celestials offered into your mouth."</p>
<p id='23'>सौतिरुवाच एवमस्त्विति तं वह्निः प्रत्युवाच पितामहम्। जगाम शासनं कर्तुं देवस्य परमेष्ठिनः॥<br />Sauti said: Agni then replied to the Grandfather, "Be it so" and he went away to obey the command of the Parameshthi (Supreme Lord).</p>
<p id='24'>देवर्षयश्च मुदितास्ततो जग्मुर्यथागतम्। ऋषयश्च यथापूर्वं क्रियाः सर्वाः प्रचक्रिरे॥<br />The Rishis and the celestial also in great delight returned to the place whence they came. And the Rishis continued to perform their ceremonies and sacrifices as before.</p>

<p id='26'>एवं स भगवाञ्छापं लेभेऽग्निर्भृगुतः पुरा। एवमेष पुरावृत्त इतिहासोऽग्निशापजः। पुलोम्नश्च विनाशोऽयं च्यवनस्य च संभवः॥<br />Thus in the days of yore, O possessor of the six attributes, was Agni cursed by Bhrigu, Such is the ancient history founded thereon, which contains the account of the destruction of Puloma, the Rakshasa and the birth of Chyavana.</p>
