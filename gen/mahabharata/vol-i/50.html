<h3>ASTIKA PARVA.: Chapter 50</h3><h4>Conversation of Parikshit and ministers</h4><p id='1'>मन्त्रिणः ऊचुः ततः स राजा राजेन्द्रः स्कन्धे तस्य भुजंगमम्। मुनेः क्षुत्क्षाम आसज्य स्वपुरं प्रययौ पुनः॥<br />The Ministers said : O king of kings, that tired and hungry monarch, having placed the snake on the shoulder of the Rishi, came back to his own capital.</p>
<p id='2'>ऋषेस्तस्य तु पुत्रोऽभूगवि जातो महायशाः। शृङ्गी नाम महातेजास्तिग्मवीर्योऽतिकोपनः॥<br />The Rishi had a son, born of a cow, named Shringi. He was greatly renowned, exceedingly powerful and greatly energetic and very wrathful.</p>
<p id='3'>ब्रह्माणं समुपागम्य मुनिः पूजां चकार ह। सोऽनुज्ञातस्ततस्तत्र शृङ्गी सुश्राव तं तदा॥<br />He went to Brahma and worshipped him. Commanded by him, Shringi was one day returning home,</p>
<p id='4'>सख्युः सकाशात्पितरं पित्रा ते धर्षितं पुरा। मृतं सर्प समासक्तं स्थाणुभूतस्य तस्य तम्॥ वहन्तं राजशार्दूलः स्कन्धेनानपकारिणम्। तपस्विनमतीवाथ तं मुनिप्रवरं नृप॥<br />When he heard from his friend how his father had been insulted by your father. He heard that he was bearing on his shoulder a dead snake as motionless as a piece of wood, without doing any injury to the man who had insulted him thus.</p>
<p id='5'>जितेन्द्रियं विशुद्धं च स्थितं कर्मण्यथाद्भुतम्। तपसा द्योतितात्मानं स्वेष्वङ्गेधुं यतं तदा॥<br />O king, (he heard that your father had insulted the Rishi) who was a great ascetic, the best of Rishis, a controller of his passions, a pious and holy man, a door of wonderful deeds, his soul enlightened with asceticism and his senses and their functions under his complete control.</p>
<p id='6'>शुभाचारं शुभकथं सुस्थितं तमलोलुपम्। अक्षुद्रमनसूयं च वृद्धं मौनव्रते स्थितम्। शरण्यं सर्वभूतानां पित्रा विनिकृतं तव॥ शशापाथ महातेजाः पितरं ते रुषान्वितः।<br />His practices were pious, his speeches pure. He was contented and had no avarice; he had not the least meanness, nor had he any avarice. He was old and observant of the vow of silence. And he was the refuge of all creatures. Such was the Rishi whom your father insulted. The son of that Rishi, however, cursed your father in anger.</p>
<p id='7'>ऋषेः पुत्रो महातेजा बालोऽपि स्थविरद्युतिः॥ स क्षिप्रमुदकं स्पृष्ट्वा रोषादिदमुवाच ह।<br />Though that son of the Rishi was but a boy, he had the splendour of mature age. He speedily touched water and spoke thus in anger,</p>
<p id='8'>पितरं तेऽभिसंधाय तेजसा प्रज्वलन्निव॥ अनागसि गुरौ यो मे मृतं सर्पमवासृजत्। तं नागस्तक्षकः क्रुद्धस्तेजसा प्रदहिष्यति॥ आशीविषस्तिग्मतेजा मद्वाक्यबलचोदितः। सप्तरात्रादितः पापं पश्य मे तपसो बलम्॥ इत्युक्त्वा प्रययौ तत्र पिता यत्राऽस्य सोऽभवत्। दृष्ट्वा च पितरं तस्मै तं शापं प्रत्यवेदयत्॥<br />With reference to your father, burning as if in effulgence, “Behold my ascetic powers. The angry and effulgent snake Takshaka, as spoken by me, will burn with his poison, within seven nights hence, the wretch who has placed a dead snake on the shoulder of my sire.“ Having said this, he went to the place where his father was. Seeing his father, he told him of the curse uttered by him.</p>
<p id='9'>स चापि मुनिशार्दूल: प्रेरयामास ते पितुः। शिष्यं गौरमुखं नाम शीलवन्तं गुणान्वितम्॥ आचख्यौ स च विश्रान्तो राज्ञः सर्वमशेषतः।<br />That best of Rishis sent to your father. A well-mannered and virtuous disciple, named Gaurmukha, After having taken rest for a while, he (Gauramukha) told everything to the king (your father,)</p>
<p id='10'>शप्तोऽसि मम पुत्रेण यतो भव महीपते॥ तक्षकस्त्वां महाराज तेजसाऽसौ दहिष्यति।<br />(Saying in the words of his preceptor) “O king, you have been cursed by my son. Takshaka will burn you with his poison. O great king, be careful.</p>
<p id='11'>श्रुत्वा च तद्वचो घोरं पिता ते जनमेजय॥ यत्तोऽभवत्परित्रस्तस्तक्षकात्पन्नगोत्तमात्।<br />O Janamejaya, your father, having heard these terrible words, took every precaution against the powerful snake Takshaka.</p>
<p id='12'>ततस्तस्मिंस्तु दिवसे सप्तमे समुपस्थिते॥ राज्ञः समीपं ब्रह्मर्षिः काश्यपो गन्तुमैच्छत।<br />When the seventh day arrived, a Brahmana Rishi, named Kashyapa, wished to come to the king.</p>
<p id='13'>तं ददर्शाथ नागेन्द्रस्तक्षकः काश्यपं तदा॥ तमब्रवीत्पन्नगेन्द्रः काश्यपं त्वरितं द्विजम्। क्व भवांस्त्वरितो याति किं च कार्यं चिकीर्षति॥<br />The king of the snakes, Takshaka, saw Kashyapa and that king of the snakes asked that Brahmana, “Where are you going in a hurry? And what is your business for which you go?"</p>
<p id='14'>काश्यप उवाच यत्र राजा कुरुश्रेष्ठः परीक्षिन्नाम वै द्विज। तक्षकेण भुजंगेन धक्ष्यते किल सोऽद्य वै॥<br />Kashyapa said : O Brahmana, I am going where the best of the Kurus, the king named Parikshit is. He will today be killed by the snake Takshaka.</p>
<p id='15'>गच्छाम्यहं तं त्वरित: सद्यः कर्तुमपज्वरम्। मयाऽभिपन्नं तं चापि न सर्पो धर्षयिष्यति॥<br />I am going in a hurry to cure him, so that he, being treated by me, may not he killed by the snake.</p>
<p id='16'>तक्षक उवाच किमर्थं तं मया दष्टं संजीवयितुमिच्छसि। अहं स तक्षको ब्रह्मन्पश्य मे वीर्यमद्भुतम्॥ न शक्तस्त्वं मया दष्टं तं संजीवयितुं नृपम्। इत्युक्त्वा तक्षकस्तत्र सोऽदशद्वै वनस्पतिम्॥<br />Takshaka said: O Brahmana, I am that very Takshaka. Why do you wish to revive the king bitten by me? Behold my wonderful power. You are incapable of reviving the king bitten by me." Having said this, Takshaka there and then bit a lord of the forest (a banian tree).</p>
<p id='17'>स दष्टपात्रो नागेन भस्मीभूतोऽभवन्नगः। काश्यपश्च ततो राजन्नजीवयत तं नगम्॥<br />The tree reduced to ashes as soon as bitten by the snake; but, О king, Kashyapa, however revived it.</p>
<p id='18'>ततस्तं लोभयामास कामं ब्रूहीति तक्षकः। स एवमुक्तस्तं प्राह काश्यपस्तक्षकं पुनः॥<br />Thereupon Takshaka, in order to tempt him, said, “Tell me what is your desire.” and Kashyapa replied to Takshaka.</p>
<p id='19'>धनलिप्सुरहं तत्र यामीत्युक्तश्च तेन सः। तमुवाच महात्मानं तक्षकः श्लक्ष्णया गिरा॥<br />“I am going there with the desire of (getting) wealth.” The illustrious Takshaka, (thereupon) told him in sweet words,</p>
<p id='20'>यावद्धनं प्रार्थयसे राजस्तस्मात्ततोऽधिकम्। गृहाण मत्त एव त्वं संनिवर्तस्व चानघ॥<br />"O sinless one, take from me more wealth than you expect to get from that king. And then go back."</p>
<p id='21'>स एवमुक्तो नागेन काश्यपो द्विपदां वरः। लब्ध्वा वित्तं निववृते तक्षकाद्यावदीप्सितम्॥<br />The best of men, Kashyapa, being thus addressed by the snake and having received from him as much wealth as he desired to get, went back.</p>
<p id='22'>तस्मिन्प्रतिगते विप्रे छद्मनोपेत्य तक्षकः। तं नृपं नृपतिश्रेष्ठं पितरं धार्मिकं तव॥ प्रासादस्थं यत्तमपि दग्धवान्विषवह्निना। ततस्त्वं पुरुषव्याघ्र विजयायाभिषेचितः॥<br />When the Brahman went back, Takshaka went in disguise to that best of kings, your virtuous father, who was then staying with all precautions in his palace; and he burnt him with the fire of his poison. After this (most lamentable event,) you, O best of kings, were installed on the throne.</p>
<p id='23'>एतदृष्टं श्रुतं चापि यथावन्नृपसत्तम। अस्माभिर्निखिलं सर्वं कथितं तेऽतिदारुणम्॥<br />O best of kings, we have told you all that we saw and heard, though the account is te: ible and cruel.</p>
<p id='24'>श्रुत्वा चैनं नरश्रेष्ठ पार्थिवस्य पराभवम्। अस्य चर्षेरुत्तङ्कस्य विधत्स्व यदनन्तरम्॥<br />O best of kings, you have now heard how (your father) the great king of the world was killed and how Rishi Uttanka was insulted, do what is proper.</p>
<p id='25'>सौतिरुवाच एतस्मिन्नेव काले तु स राजा जनमेजयः। उवाच मन्त्रिणः सर्वानिदं वाक्यमरिंदमः॥<br />Sauti said : Thereupon the chastiser of foes, Janamejaya addressed all his ministers thus.</p>
<p id='26'>जनमेजय उवाच अथ तत्कथितं केन यद्वृत्तं तद्वनस्पतौ। आश्चर्यभूतं लोकस्य भस्मराशिकृतं तदा॥ यवृक्षं जीवयामास काश्यपस्तक्षकेण वै। नूनं मन्त्रैर्हतविषो न प्रणश्येत काश्यपात्॥<br />Janamejaya said : From whom have you heard this wonderful account of the lord of the forest, burnt to ashes by Takshaka and revived again by Kashyapa? My father could not have certainly died were the poison neutralised by the Mantras of Kashyapa.</p>
<p id='27'>चिन्तयामास पापात्मा मनसा पन्नगाधमः। दष्टं यदि मया विप्रः पार्थिवं जीवयिष्यति॥<br />The sinful wretch, the worst of the snakes (Takshaka), thought in his mind, If a Brahmana revives the king bitten by me,</p>
<p id='28'>तक्षकः संहतविषो लोके यास्यति हास्यताम्। विचिन्त्यैवं कृता तेन ध्रुवं तुष्टिर्द्विजस्य वै॥<br />"All the world will laugh at me saying, Takshaka had no poison any longer.” Certainly having thought so, he gratified the Brahmana.</p>
<p id='29'>भविष्यति झुपायेन यस्य दास्यामि यातनाम्। एकं तु श्रोतुमिच्छामि तद्वृत्तं निर्जने वने।॥ संवादं पन्नगेन्द्रस्य काश्यपस्य च कस्तदा। श्रुतवान्दृष्टवांश्चापि भवत्सु कथमागतम्। श्रुत्वा तस्य विधास्येऽहं पन्नगान्तकरी मतिम्॥<br />I have however, devised a means by which I shall punish him. I now wish to hear how you heard and how you saw what happened in the solitude of the forest, especially the conversation between Takshaka and Kashyapa. Having heard this, I shall devise means for the destruction of the snakes,</p>
<p id='30'>मन्त्रिण: ऊचु: शृणु राजन्यथाऽस्माकं येन तत्कथितं पुरा। समागतं द्विजेन्द्रस्य पन्नगेन्द्रस्य चाध्वनि॥<br />The Ministers said : O king, hear from whom we heard the conversation between that king of the Brahmanas and the king of the snakes.</p>
<p id='31'>तस्मिन्वृक्षे नरः कश्चिदिन्धनार्थाय पार्थिवः। विचिन्वन्पूर्वमारूढः शुष्कशाखावनस्पतौ॥<br />O king, a certain man had climbed that lord of the forest to collect its dry twigs for sacrificial fuel.</p>
<p id='32'>न बुध्येतामुभौ तौ च नगस्थं पन्नगद्विजौ। सह तेनैव वृक्षण भस्मीभूतोऽभवन्नृप॥<br />He was not seen by the Brahmana or the snake. O king, he too was reduced to ashes with the tree.</p>
<p id='33'>द्विजप्रभावाद्राजेन्द्र व्यजीवत्स वनस्पतिः। तेनागम्य द्विजश्रेष्ठ पुंसाऽस्मासु निवेदितम्॥<br />O king of kings, he was revived with the tree by the power of the Brahmana. That man, a servant of a Brahmana, came to us,</p>
<p id='34'>यथावृत्तं तु तत्सर्वं तक्षकस्य द्विजस्य च। एतत्ते कथितं राजन्यथा दृष्टं श्रुतं च यत्। श्रुत्वा च नृपशार्दूल विधत्स्व यदनन्तरम्॥<br />And told us in detail what happened between Takshaka and the Brahmana. O king, we are thus able to tell you what we saw or heard. O best of kings, having heard it, do what should be done now.</p>
<p id='35'>सौतिरुवाच मन्त्रिणां तु वचः श्रुत्वा स राजा जनमेजयः। पर्यतप्यत दुःखार्त: प्रत्यपिंषत्करं करे॥<br />Sauti said : Having heard the words of the ministers, the king Janamejaya began to weep in grief and squeezed his hands.</p>
<p id='36'>निःश्वासमुष्णमसकृद्दीधैं राजीवलोचनः। मुमोचाश्रूणि च तदा नेत्राभ्यां प्ररुदन्नृपः॥<br />The lotus-eyed king breathed long and hot breaths; the king shed tears and wept aloud.</p>
<p id='37'>उवाच च महीपालो दुःखशोकसमन्वितः। दुर्धरं बाष्पमुत्सृज्य स्पृष्ट्वा चापो यथाविधि॥ मूहूर्तमिव च ध्यात्वा निश्चित्य मनसा नृपः। अमर्षी मन्त्रिणः सर्वानिदं वचनमब्रवीत॥<br />The king, afflicted with grief and sorrow, shed tears and touching water according to the form, thought for a while as if sifting something in his mind. Then addressing all his ministers, he said :</p>
<p id='38'>जनमेजय उवाच श्रुत्वैतद्भवतां वाक्यं पितुर्मे स्वर्गतिं प्रति॥ निश्चितेयं मम मतिर्या च तां मे निबोधत। अनन्तरं च मन्येऽहं तक्षकाय दुरात्मने।॥ प्रतिकर्तव्यमित्येवं येन मे हिंसितः पिता। शृङ्गिणं हेतुमात्रं यः कृत्वा दग्ध्वा च पार्थिवम्॥ ४९।<br />Janamejaya said : I have heard your account of my father's ascension to heaven. Know now what is my fixed resolve. No time should be lost to avenge the wretch Takshaka who killed my father. The wretch killed the king, making Shringi a mere pretext.</p>
<p id='39'>इयं दुरात्मता तस्य काश्यपं यो न्यवर्तयत्। यदा गच्छेत्स वै विप्रो ननु जीवेत्पिता मम॥<br />Out of malignity alone he prevented Kashyapa from coming. If that Brahmana had come, my father would have certainly lived.</p>
<p id='40'>परिहीयेत किं तस्य यदि जीवेत्स पार्थिवः। काश्यपस्य प्रसादेन मन्त्रिणां विनयेन च॥<br />What harm could have possibly come to him if the king had revived by the grace of Kashyapa and the precautions taken by the ministers?</p>
<p id='41'>स तु वारितवान्मोहात्काश्यपं द्विजसत्तमम्। संजिजीवयिषु प्राप्तं राजानमपराजितम्॥<br />He, being ignorant of my anger, prevented that best of Brahmana, Kashyapa, from coming to my unconquerable father.</p>
<p id='42'>महानतिक्रमो ह्येष तक्षकस्य दुरात्मनः। द्विजस्य योददद् द्रव्यं मा नृपं जीवयेदिति॥<br />The aggression of the wretch Takshaka is great, for he gave wealth to the Brahmana, so that he might not revive the king.</p>
<p id='43'>उत्तङ्कस्य प्रियं कर्तुमात्मनश्च महत्प्रियम्। भवतां चैव सर्वेषां गच्छाम्यपचितिं पितुः॥<br />I must avenge myself on my father's enemy, to please myself, to please Uttanka and you all.</p>
