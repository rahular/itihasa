<h3>VIDURAGAMANA-RAJYALABHA PARVA: Chapter 210</h3><h4>History of Sunda and Upasunda</h4><p id='1'>नारद उवाच उत्सवे वृत्तमात्रे तु त्रैलोक्याकाक्षिणावुभौ। मन्त्रयित्वा ततः सेनां तावाज्ञापयतां तदा॥<br />Narada said: As soon as the festivals came to an end, they (Sunda and Upasunda), being desirous of the sovereignty of the three worlds, took counsel and commanded their forces to be arranged.</p>
<p id='2'>सुहृद्भिरप्यनुज्ञातौ दैत्यैर्वृद्धैश्च मन्त्रिभिः। कृत्वा प्रास्थानिकं रात्रौ मघासु ययतुस्तदा॥<br />Having obtained the consent of their friends and relatives, of the elder, of the Danava race and of their ministers and having performed the preliminary rites of departure, they started on the night when the constellation Magha was on the ascendant.</p>
<p id='3'>गदापट्टिशधारिण्या शूलमुद्गरहस्तया। प्रस्थितौ सह वर्मिण्या महत्या दैत्यसेनया॥ मङ्गलैः स्तुतिभिश्चापि विजयप्रतिसंहितैः। चारणैः स्तूयमानो तौ जग्मतुः परया मुदा॥<br />A large army of the Danavas clad in mails and armed with clubs, axes, lances and maces, went with them. The Charanas chanted auspicious panegyrics indicative of their future victory; and they sat out on their expedition with joyous hearts.</p>
<p id='4'>तावन्तरिक्षमुत्प्लुत्य दैत्यौ कामगमावुभौ। देवानामेव भवनं जग्मतुर्युद्धदुर्मदौ॥<br />Furious in war and capable of going everywhere at will, the two Danavas rose to the sky and went to the region of the celestials.</p>
<p id='5'>तयोरागमनं ज्ञात्वा वरदानं च तत् प्रभोः। हित्वा त्रिविष्टपं जग्मुर्ब्रह्मलोकं ततः सुराः॥<br />Learning that they were coming and knowing also what boons they had obtained from the Supreme Lord, the celestials left heaven and sought refuge in the region of Brahma.</p>
<p id='6'>ताविन्द्रलोकं निर्जिय यक्षरक्षोगणांस्तदा। खेचराण्यपि भूतानि जनतुस्तीव्रविक्रमौ॥<br />The greatly powerful (Danava) brothers subjugated the region of Indra and defeated various tribes of Yakshas and Rakshasas. They then returned.</p>
<p id='7'>अन्तर्भूमिगतान् नागाञ्जित्वा तौ च महारथौ। समुद्रवासिनीः सर्वा म्लेच्छजातीर्विजिग्यतुः॥<br />The two great car-warriors then subjugated the Nagas of the nether regions, then the inmates of the ocean and then all the Mleccha races.</p>
<p id='8'>ततः सर्वां महीं जेतुमारब्धावुग्रशासनौ। सैनिकांश्च समाहूय सुतीक्ष्णं वाक्यमूचतुः॥ राजर्षयो महायज्ञैर्हव्यकव्यैर्द्विजातयः। तेजो बलं च देवानां वर्धयन्ति श्रियं तथा॥<br />Being desirous of subjugating the whole earth, those two greatly irresistible heroes, summoning their soldiers, spoke these cruel words, “The royal sages with the help of the Brahmanas increase the strength and prosperity of the celestials by pouring libations on the fire and offering other foods in grand sacrifices.</p>
<p id='9'>तेषामेवंप्रवृत्तानां सर्वेषामसुरद्विषाम्। सम्भूय सर्वैरस्माभिः कार्यः सर्वात्मना वधः॥<br />"Engaged in such works, they are the enemies of the Asuras. Therefore, the duty of all of us is to muster together and exterminate them."</p>
<p id='10'>एवं सर्वान् समादिश्य पूर्वतीरे महोदधेः। क्रूरां मतिं समास्थाय जग्मतुः सर्वतोमुखौ॥<br />Thus ordering them all on the eastern shore of the great ocean and forming such a cruel resolution, the Asura brothers started in all directions.</p>
<p id='11'>यज्ञैर्यजन्ति ये केचिद् याजयन्ति च ये द्विजाः। तान् सर्वान् प्रसभं हत्वा बलिनौ जग्मतुस्ततः॥<br />The two heroes immediately killed those that were performing sacrifices and the Brahmanas that were assisting in those sacrifices. Killing them all, they started for another place.</p>
<p id='12'>आश्रमेष्वग्निहोत्राणि मुनीनां भावितात्मनाम्। गृहीत्वा प्रक्षिपन्त्यप्सु विश्रब्धं संनिकास्तयोः॥<br />Their soldiers threw into the water the sacrificial fires that were in the hermitages o Rishis who had controlled their souls.</p>
<p id='13'>तपोधनैश्च ये क्रुद्धैः शापा उक्ता महात्मभिः। नाक्रामन्त तयोस्तेऽपि वरदाननिराकृताः॥<br />The curses uttered by the high-souled ascetics in anger became futile on account of the boons granted to them (by Brahma); but they did not any way affect them.</p>
<p id='14'>नाक्रामन्त यदा शापा बाणा मुक्ताः शिलास्विव। नियमान् सम्परित्यज्य व्यद्रवन्त द्विजातयः॥<br />When the Brahmanas saw that their curses make no impressions on them like arrows shot at stones, they fled in all directions, forsaking their rites and vows.</p>
<p id='15'>पृथिव्यां ये तप:सिद्धा दान्ताः शमपरायणाः। तयोर्भयाद् दुदुवुस्ते वैनतेयादिवोरगाः॥<br />Even those, that were crowned with ascetic success in the world and that were selfcontrolled and wholly engrossed in meditation of the Deity, fled in their fear as snakes at the approach of the son of Vinata (Garuda).</p>
<p id='16'>मथितैराश्रमैर्भग्नैर्विकीर्णकलशनुवैः। शून्यमासीज्जगत् सर्वं कालेनेव हतं तदा॥<br />All the sacred hermitages were trodden down and broken; and their contents were scattered all over the ground. The universe became empty, as if every thing was destroyed at a Dissolution.</p>
<p id='17'>ततो राजन्नदृश्यद्भिर्ऋषिभिश्च महासुरौ। उभौ विनिश्चयं कृत्वा विकुर्वाते वधैषिणौ॥<br />O king, when all the Rishis had disappeared, the two great Asuras resolved upon their destruction and assumed various forms.</p>
<p id='18'>प्रभिन्नकरटौ मत्तौ भूत्वा कुञ्जररूपिणौ। संलीनमपि दुर्गेषु निन्यतुर्यमसादनम्॥<br />They assumed the forms of maddened elephants with temples rent (from excess of juice) and they slaughtered the Rishis hidden in mountain caves.</p>
<p id='19'>सिंहौ भूत्वा पुनर्व्याघ्रौ पुनश्चान्तर्हितावुभौ। तैस्तैरुपायैस्तौ क्रूरावृषीन् दृष्ट्वा निजजतुः॥<br />Sometimes they became lions, sometimes tigers and sometime, they disappeared. By assuming such forms, they killed the Rishis wherever they saw them.</p>
<p id='20'>निवृत्तयज्ञस्वाध्याया प्रणष्टनृपतिद्विजा। उत्सन्नोत्सवयज्ञा च बभूव वसुधा तदा॥<br />Sacrifice and study ceased; kings and Brahmanas were exterminated. The earth became destitute of festivals and sacrifices.</p>
<p id='21'>हाहाभूता भयार्ता च निवृत्तविपणापणा। निवृत्तदेवकार्या च पुण्योद्वाहविवर्जिता॥<br />The people cried, “Alas! Alas!” and all buying and selling were stopped. The works of the celestials ceased and sacred ceremonies and marriages discontinued.</p>
<p id='22'>निवृत्तकृषिगोरक्षा विध्वस्तनगराश्रमा। अस्थिकङ्कालसंकीर्णा भूर्वभूवोग्रदर्शना॥<br />Agriculture was neglected and cattle were not tended; both cities and hermitages became desolate. The earth, being covered with bones and skeletons, looked fearful,</p>
<p id='23'>निवृत्तपितृकार्यं च निर्वषट्कारमङ्गलम्। जगत् प्रतिभयाकारं दुष्प्रेक्ष्यमभवत् तदा॥<br />The ceremonies in honour of the Pitris, the sacred sound of Vashata (Vedas) and all auspicious rites ceased. The universe looked frightful to behold.</p>
<p id='24'>चन्द्रादित्यौ ग्रहास्तारा नक्षत्राणि दिवौकसः। जग्मुर्विषादं तत् कर्म दृष्ट्वा सुन्दोपसुन्दयोः॥<br />The moon, the sun, the planets, the stars, the constellations and the dwellers of heaven, became exceedingly sorry on seeing these works of Sunda and Upasunda.</p>
<p id='25'>एवं सर्वा दिशो दैत्यौ जित्वा क्रूरेण कर्मणा। निःसप्नौ कुरुक्षेत्रे निवेशमभिचक्रतुः॥<br />Thus subjugating all the points of heaven by cruel acts, the Danavas lived at Kurukshetra having not a single rival (in all the earth).</p>
