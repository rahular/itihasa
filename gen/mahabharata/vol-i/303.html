<h3>DYUTA PARVA: Chapter 69</h3><h4>Words of Bhisma</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>द्रौपद्युवाच पुरस्तात् करणीयं मे न कृतं कार्यमुत्तरम्। विह्वलास्मि कृतानेन कर्षता बलिना बलात्॥<br />Draupadi said I have a duty to perform. I have not as yet performed that great work. Forcibly dragged by this strong man (Dushasana), I am deprived of my senses.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>अभिवादं करोम्येषां कुरूणां कुरुसंसदि। न मे स्यादपराधोऽयं यदिदं न कृतं मया।॥<br />I salute all my superiors in this assembly of the Kurus. It is not my fault if I have not done it before.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच सा तेन च समाधूता दुःखेन च तपस्विनी। पतिता विललापेदं सभायामतथोचिता॥<br />Vaishampayana said Dragged with greater force the afflicted and ascetic lady (Draupadi) who did not deserve such treatment, fell on the ground and wept in the assembly.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>द्रौपद्युवाच स्वयंवरे यास्मि नृपैदृष्टा रङ्गे समागतैः। न दृष्टपूर्वा चान्यत्र साहमद्य सभां गता॥<br />Draupadi said I was once seen on the occasion of my Svamavara by the assembled kings in the arena. I was never before seen (by them) any where else. I am to day been brought before the assembly.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>यां न वायुर्न चादित्यो दृष्टवन्तौ पुरा गृहे। साहमद्य सभामध्ये दृश्यास्मि जनसंसदि॥<br />She, who is never before seen by even the wind and the sun in her house, is seen to day in the assembly and is exposed before all men.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>यां न मृष्यन्ति वातेन स्पृश्यमानां गृहे पुरा। स्पृश्यमानां सहन्तेऽद्य पाण्डवास्तां दुरात्मना॥<br />We have never heard before that a wedded wife is brought before an assembly. That old and eternal rule is to day destroyed by the Kurus.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>मृष्यन्ति कुरवश्चमे मन्ये कालस्य पर्ययम्। सुषां दुहितरं चैव क्लिश्यमानामनर्हतीम्॥<br />She, whom the Pandavas did not suffer to be touched (even) by the wind before, is to day suffered by them to be persecuted by the wicked men.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>किं न्वतः कृपणं भूयो यदहं स्त्री सती शुभा। सभामध्यं विगाहेऽद्य क्व नु धर्मो महीक्षिताम्॥<br />It appears the time has became out of joint, when the Kurus suffer their daughter and daughter-in-law, who is so unworthy of such treatment, to be thus persecuted.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>धर्म्या स्त्रियं सभा पूर्वे न नयन्तीति नः श्रुतम्। स नष्टः कौरवेयेषु पूर्वो धर्मः सनातनः॥<br />What could be more digressing to me than that through I am high born and chaste, yet I should be brought into the assembly. Where is the Dharma of these kings?</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>कथं हि भार्या पाण्डूनां पार्षतस्य स्वसा सती। वासुदेवस्य च सखी पार्थिवानां सभामियाम्॥<br />How is it that the chaste wife of the Pandavas, the sister of the son of Prishata, the friend of Vasudeva (Krishna), is brought before the assembly of the kings?</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>तामिमां धर्मराजस्य भार्यां सदृशवर्णजाम्। बूत दासीमदासीं वा तत् करिष्यामि कौरवाः॥<br />O Kauravas, I am the wife of Dharmaraja (Yudhisthira), born in the same order to which the king belongs. Tell me whether I am a servant woman or not. I shall cheerfully do what you would say.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>अयं मां सुदृढं क्षुद्रः कौरवाणां यशोहरः। क्लिश्नाति नाहं तत् सोढुं चिरं शक्ष्यामि कौरवाः॥<br />O Kurus, this low man, this destroyer of the Kuru fame, is cruelly persecuting me. I cannot bear it any longer.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>जितां वाप्यजितां वापि मन्यध्वं मां यथा नृपाः। तथा प्रत्युक्तमिच्छामि तत् करिष्यामि कौरवाः॥<br />O kings, O Kurus, I desire you to answer whether you consider me as won or unwon. I shall do what you would say.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>भीष्म उवाच उक्तवानस्मि कल्याणि धर्मस्य परमा गतिः। लोके न शक्यते ज्ञातुमपि विज्ञैर्महात्मभिः॥<br />Bhisma said O blessed lady, I have said the course of Dharma is subtle. Even the illustrious wise men cannot understand it in the world.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>बलवांश्च यथा धर्म लोके पश्यति पूरुषः। स धर्मो धर्मवेलायां भवत्यभिहतः परः॥<br />What a powerful man says morality in the world is regarded as such by others, however otherwise it may really be. What a weak man says, however morality it may be, is not regarded as such.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>न विवेक्तुं च ते प्रश्नमिमं शक्नोमि निश्चयात्। सूक्ष्मत्वाद् गहनत्वाच्च कार्यस्यास्य च गौरवात्॥<br />From the importance of the issue involved, from its intricacy and subtility, I am unable to answer with certainly the question you have asked.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>नूनमन्तः कुलस्यायं भविता नचिरादिव। तथा हि कुरवः सर्वे लोभमोहपरायणाः॥<br />It is certain that as all the Kurus have become the slaves of covetousness and folly, the destruction of this our race will happen on no distant date.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>कुलेषु जाताः कल्याणि व्यसनैराहता भृशम्। धर्म्यान्मार्गान्न च्यवन्ते येषां नस्त्वं वधूः स्थिता॥<br />O blessed one, the family into which you have been admitted as a daughter-in-law is such that there are men and women born in it, however they might be afflicted by calamities, they never deviate from the path of virtue.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>उपपन्नं च पाञ्चालि तवेदं वृत्तमीदृशम्। यत् कृच्छ्रमपि सम्प्राप्ता धर्ममेवान्ववेक्षसे॥<br />O Panchali, your this conduct, namely through persecuted, you still cast your eyes on Dharma, is certainly worthy of you.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>एते द्रोणादयश्चैव वृद्धा धर्मविदो जनाः। शून्यैः शरीरैस्तिष्ठन्ति गतासव इवानताः॥<br />These men of mature years, learned in the precepts of morality, (namely) Drona and others, sit with down cast heads like men who are dead and whose lives have departed from their bodies.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>युधिष्ठिरस्तु प्रश्नेऽस्मिन् प्रमाणमिति मे मतिः। अजितां वा जितां वेति स्वयं व्याहर्तुमर्हति॥<br />My opinion is that Yudhisthira himself is an authority in this question. He should say whether you are won or not won.</p>
