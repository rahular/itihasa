<h3>VIDURAGAMANA-RAJYALABHA PARVA: Chapter 212</h3><h4>History Sunda and Upasunda</h4><p id='1'>नारद उवाच जित्वा तु पृथिवीं दैत्यौ निःसपत्नौ गतव्यथौ। कृत्वा त्रैलोक्यमव्यग्रं कृतकृत्यौ बभूवतुः॥<br />Narada said: Subjugating the whole earth, the two Danavas became unrivalled; and when they had brought the three worlds under their sway, they then considered themselves free from fatigue and regarded that their works were done.</p>
<p id='2'>देवगन्धर्वयक्षाणां नागपार्थिवरक्षसाम्। आदाय सर्वरत्नानि परां तुष्टिमुपागतौ॥<br />Having taken all the wealth of the Devas, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the Nagas, the Rakshasas, the kings, they become exceedingly happy.</p>
<p id='3'>यदा न प्रतिषेद्धारस्तयोः सन्तीह केचन। निरुद्योगौ तदा भूत्वा विजह्रातेऽमराविव॥<br />When they saw they had no rival, like the immortals they gave up all labour and exertion and they passed their time in pleasures and merriments.</p>
<p id='4'>स्त्रीभिर्माल्यैश्च गन्धैश्च भक्ष्यभोज्यैः सुपुष्कलैः। पानैश्च विविधैर्हद्यैः परां प्रीतिमवापतुः॥<br />They derived great pleasure in women, in garlands, in perfumes, in viands, in drinks and in various other article of enjoyments.</p>
<p id='5'>अन्तःपुरवनोद्याने पर्वतेषु वनेषु च। यथेप्सितेषु देशेषु विजह्रातेऽमराविव॥<br />Like the immortals they roamed in profuse pleasure and amusement in houses, in woods, in gardens, in forests and on hills, nay wherever they liked.</p>
<p id='6'>ततः कदाचिद् विन्ध्यस्य प्रस्थे समशिलातले। पुष्पिताग्रेषु शालेषु विहारमभिजग्मतुः॥<br />Thereupon one day they went to sport to a table-land of the Vindhya mountain, on perfectly level and stony ground, overgrown with Sala trees blossomed with flowers.</p>
<p id='7'>दिव्येषु सर्वकामेषु समानीतेषु तावुभौ। वरासनेषु संहृष्टौ सह स्त्रीभिर्निषीदतुः॥<br />After every object of desire of the most agreeable kind had been brought, they (Sunda and Upasunda) sat on an excellent seat in happiness and joy with many handsome women (around them).</p>
<p id='8'>ततो वादिनृत्याभ्यामुपातिष्ठन्त तौ स्त्रियः। गीतेश्च स्तुतिसंयुक्तैः प्रीत्या समुपजग्मिरे॥<br />Wishing to please those two (heroes), those damsels danced in accompaniment with music and sang many songs in praise of the mighty brothers.</p>
<p id='9'>ततस्तिलोत्तमा तत्र बने पुष्पाणि चिन्वती। वेशं साऽऽक्षिप्तमाधाय रक्तेनैकेन वाससा॥<br />Thereupon Tilottama, attired in a single red silk cloth and thereby exposing all her charms, came there gathering flowers in the forest.</p>
<p id='10'>नदीतीरेषु जातान् सा कर्णिकारान् प्रचिन्वती। शनैर्जगाम तं देशं यत्रास्तां तौ महासुरौ॥<br />Gathering Karnikaras that grew along the barks of the river, she slowly came to the place where those two great heroes were.</p>
<p id='11'>तौ तु पीत्वा वरं पानं मदरक्तान्तलोचनौ। दृष्ट्वैव तां वरारोहां व्यथितौ सम्बभूवतुः॥<br />They were intoxicated with a large quantity of liquor and their eyes had grown red. As soon as they saw that most beautiful damsel, they were filled with desire.</p>
<p id='12'>तावुत्थायासनं हित्वा जग्मतुर्यत्र सा स्थिता। उभौ च कामसम्मत्तावुभौ प्राथर्यतश्च ताम्॥<br />Leaving their seat, they immediately went to the place where she was. Both being full of desire, both sought her favours.</p>
<p id='13'>दक्षिणे तां करे सुभ्रं सुन्दो जग्राह पाणिना। उपसुन्दोऽपि जग्राह वामे पाणौ तिलोत्तमाम्॥<br />Sunda caught that beauty of fair eyebrows by her right hand and Upasunda caught hold of the left hand of Tilottama.</p>
<p id='14'>वरप्रदानमत्तौ तावौरसेन बलेन च। धनरत्नमदाभ्यां च सुरापानमदेन च॥<br />Intoxicated with the boons that they had obtained, with their physical strength, with the wealth and gems they had amassed and with the wine they had drunk.</p>
<p id='15'>सवैरतैर्मदैर्मत्तावन्योन्यं भृकुटीकृतौ। मदकामसमाविष्टौ परस्परमथोचतुः॥<br />Intoxicated with all this and maddened with desire, each of them contracted his eyebrows in anger; and they then spoke thus to each other.</p>
<p id='16'>मम भार्या तव गुरुरिति सुन्दोऽभ्यभाषत। मम भार्या तव वधूरुपसुन्दोऽभ्यभाषत॥<br />Sunda said, "She is my wife and your superior." Upasunda said, "She is my wife and your sister-in-law."</p>
<p id='17'>नैषा तव ममैषेति ततस्तौ मन्युराविशत्। तस्या रूपेण सम्पत्तौ विगतस्नेहसौहृदौ॥<br />They each exclaimed, "She is mine, not yours.” Maddened by her beauty, they lost all love and friendship (that they bore for each other).</p>
<p id='18'>तस्या हेतोर्गदे भीमे संगृहणीतावुभौ तदा। प्रगृह्य च गदे भीमे तस्यां तौ काममोहितौ॥<br />For her sake they went for their, maces and deprived of heir reason by desire, they took of their fearful clubs.</p>
<p id='19'>अहं पूर्वमहं पूर्वमित्यन्योन्यं निजघ्नतुः। तौ गदाभिहतौ भीमौ पेततुर्धरणीतले॥<br />(Crying), "I was the first,” (in taking her hand), they attacked each other. Struck by those fearful clubs, both of them fell on the ground.</p>
<p id='20'>रुधिरेणावसिक्ताङ्गौ द्वाविवाौं नभश्च्युतौ। ततस्ता विद्रुता नार्यः स च दैत्यगणस्तथा॥ पातालमगमत् सर्वो विषाद्भयकम्पितः। ततः पितामहस्तत्र सह देवैर्महर्षिभिः॥ आजगाम विशुद्धात्मा पूजयंश्च तिलोत्तमाम्। वरेणच्छन्दयामास भगवान् प्रपितामहः॥<br />Their bodies being covered with blood they looked like two suns loosened from the sky. The women and the others that were present all fled away trembling in grief and fear; and took refuge in the nether regions. Thereupon the pure souled Grandsire with the celestials and great Rishis came there and applauded Tilottama. The illustrious Grandsire cheered her by granting boons. Before she spoke, the Grandsire thus spoke in cheerfulness,</p>
<p id='21'>वरं दित्सुः स तत्रैनां प्रीतः प्राह पितामहः। आदित्यचरिताल्लोकान् विचरिष्यसि भाविनि॥ तेजसा च सुदृष्टां त्वां न करिष्यति कश्चन। एवं तस्यै वरं दत्त्वा सर्वलोकपितामहः॥ इन्द्रे त्रैलोक्यमाधाय ब्रह्मलोकं गतः प्रभुः।<br />"O beautiful damsel, you shall roam in the region of the suns. Your splendour will be so great that none will ever be able to took at you.” Having granted this boon to her, the Grandsire of all creatures, the Supreme lord, placed Indra over the region of Indra and went away to the region of Brahma.</p>
<p id='22'>नारद उवाच एवं तौ सहितौ भूत्वा सर्वार्थेष्वेकनिश्चयौ॥ तिलोत्तमार्थं संक्रुद्धावन्योन्यमभिजघ्नतुः। तस्माद् ब्रवीमि वः स्नेहात् सर्वान् भरतसत्तमाः॥ यथा वो नात्र भेदः स्यात् सर्वेषां द्रौपदीकृते। तथा कुरुत भद्रं वो मम चेत् प्रियमिच्छथ॥<br />Thus those two Asuras, ever united and inspired with the same purpose, killed each other in anger for the sake of Tilottama. O best of the Bharata race, therefore, from affection for you all, I tell you that if you wish to do anything agreeable to me, make some such arrangement as you may not quarrel with one another for the sake of Draupadi.</p>
<p id='23'>वैशम्पायन उवाच एवमुक्ता महात्मानो नारदेन महर्षिणा। समयं चक्रिरे राजस्तेऽन्योन्यवशमागताः। समक्षं तस्य देवर्षेनारदस्यामितौजसः॥ द्रौपद्या नः सहासीनानन्योन्यं योऽभिदर्शयत्। स नो द्वादश वर्षाणि ब्रह्मचारी वने वसेत्॥ कृते तु समये तस्मिन् पाण्डवैर्धर्मचारिभिः। नारदोऽप्यगमत् प्रीत इष्टं देशं महामुनिः॥<br />Vaishampayana said : O king having been thus addressed by the high-souled great Rishi Narada, they (the Pandavas) consulted with one another and established a rule in the presence of the celestials Rishi of immeasurable energy that when one of them would be with Draupadi, any of the other four, who would see that one, must go to the forest for twelve years to lead the life of a Brahmachari. After the virtuous Pandavas had established this rule among themselves, the great Rishi Narada, being pleased with them, went to the place he wished (to go).</p>
<p id='24'>एवं तैः समयः पूर्वं कृतो नारदचोदितैः। न चाभिद्यन्त ते सर्वे तदान्योन्येन भारत॥<br />O descendant of Bharata, thus requested by Narada, they (the Pandavas) made in the days of yore a rule amongst themselves with respect to their common wife. It was, therefore, that no dispute ever arose amongst them.</p>
