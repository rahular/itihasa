But, O king, he did nothing against the precepts of religion.</p>

<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>स सम्प्राप्य शुभान् कामांस्तृप्तः खित्रश्च पार्थिवः। कालं वर्षसहस्रान्तं सस्मार मनुजाधिपः॥ परिसंख्याय कालज्ञः कला: काष्ठाश्च वीर्यवान्। यौवनं प्राप्य राजर्षिः सहस्रपरिवत्सरान्॥ विश्वाच्या सहितो रेमे व्यभ्राजन्नन्दने वने। अलकायां स कालं तु मेरुशृङ्गे तथोत्तरे॥ यदा स पश्यते कालं धर्मात्मा तं महीपतिः। पूर्णं मत्वा ततः कालं पूरूं पुत्रमुवाच ह॥<br />The king (Yayati) became exceedingly happy in thus being able to enjoy all the best objects of enjoyments. That king of men was only sorry (in remembering) that one thousand years would soon come to an end. That royal sage, learned in the mystery of time and possessed of great prowess, having obtained youth for one thousand years and watching proper Kalas and Kashthas. Sported with Vishvachi (Apsara), some time in the garden (of Indra) Nandana, sometimes in Aloka and sometimes on the summit of the Meru Mountain. That virtuous king then found that the fixed time (one thousand) years had come to an end. He then called Puru and addressed him thus.</p>
