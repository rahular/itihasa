<h3>CHAITRARATHA PARVA: Chapter 178</h3><h4>History of Aurva</h4><p id='1'>गन्धर्व उवाच आश्रमस्था ततः पुत्रमदृश्यन्ती व्यजायता शक्तेः कुलकरं राजन् द्वितीयमिव शक्तिनम्॥<br />The Gandharva said : o king, residing in the hermitage, Adrishyanti gave birth to a son who was the perpetuator of Shakti's race and who was like a second Shakti.</p>
<p id='2'>जातकर्मादिकास्तस्य क्रियाः स मुनिसत्तमः। पौत्रस्य भरतश्रेष्ठ चकार भगवान् स्वयम्॥<br />O best of the Bharata race, that best of Rishis, that illustrious man (Vasishtha), himself performed the usual birth ceremonies of his grandson.</p>
<p id='3'>परासुः स यतस्तेन वसिष्ठः स्थापितो मुनिः। गर्भस्तेन ततो लोके पराशर इति स्मृतः॥<br />Because the Rishi Vasishtha had determined to kill himself, but had refrained from doing it as soon as he heard of the conception, the child (when born) was known in the world by the name of Parashara.</p>
<p id='4'>अमन्यत स धर्मात्मा वसिष्ठं पितरं मुनिः। जन्मप्रभृति तस्मिंस्तु पितरीवान्ववर्तत॥<br />That virtuous-minded man (Parashara) knew from the day of his birth Vasishtha as his father and behaved towards him as such.</p>
<p id='5'>स तात इति विप्रर्षिर्वसिष्ठं प्रत्यभाषत। मातुः समक्षं कौन्तेय अदृश्यन्त्याः परंतपः॥<br />O son of Kunti, O chastiser of foes the child called the Brahmana Rishi Vasishtha as "father" before his mother Adrishyanti.</p>
<p id='6'>तातेति परिपूर्णार्थं तस्य तन्मधुरं वचः। अदृश्यन्त्यश्रुपूर्णाक्षी शृण्वती तमुवाच ह॥<br />Hearing the well explained word "father" uttered sweetly by her son, Adrishyanti with tearful eyes thus spoke to him,</p>
<p id='7'>मा तात तात तातेति ब्रूह्येनं पितरं पितुः। रक्षसा भक्षितस्तात तव तातो वनान्तरे॥<br />"O child, do not address your father's father as your father. O son, your father was devoured by a Rakshasas in another forest.</p>
<p id='8'>मन्यसे यं त तातेति नैष तातस्तवानघ। आर्य एष पिता तस्य पितुस्तव यशस्विनः॥<br />O sinless one, he is not your father whom you consider to be (your father). The reverend man is the father of your illustrious father.”</p>
<p id='9'>स एवमुक्तो दुःखार्तः सत्यवागृषिसत्तमः। सर्वलोकविनाशाय मतिं चक्रे महामनाः॥<br />Having been thus addressed, that truthful and excellent Rishi became grieved and that high-souled man resolved to destroy the whole creation.</p>
<p id='10'>तं तथा निश्चितात्मानं स महात्मा महातपाः। ऋषिर्ब्रह्मविदां श्रेष्ठो मैत्रावरुणिरन्त्यधीः॥ वसिष्ठो वारयामास हेतुना येन तच्छृणु।<br />Seeing him resolved in doing this, that high-souled and greatly ascetic Rishi, that best of all men learned in the Vedas, that son of Mitravaruna, that Rishi acquainted with the positive truth, Vasishtha, prevented him (from accomplishing his desire by arguments). Hear them (now).</p>
