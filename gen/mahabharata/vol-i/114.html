<h3>SAMBHAVA PARVA: Chapter 114</h3><h4>marriage of Vidura,</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच धृतराष्ट्राभ्यनुज्ञातः स्वबाहुविजितं धनम्। भीष्माय सत्यवत्यै च मात्रे चोपजहार सः॥<br />Vaishampayana said : He (Pandu), at the command of Dhritarashtra, offered the wealth acquired by the prowess of his arms of Bhishma, to Satyavati and to their mother (Kausalya).</p>
<p id='2'>विदुराय च वै पाण्डुः प्रेषयामास तद् धनम्। सुहृदश्चापि धर्मात्मा धनेन समतर्पयत्॥<br />Pandu sent a portion of the wealth to Vidura. The virtuous minded man (Pandu) gratified his friends and relatives with (the presents of) wealth.</p>
<p id='3'>ततः सत्यवती भीष्मं कौसल्यां च यशस्विनीम्। शुभैः पाण्डुजितैरथै स्तोषयामास भारत॥<br />The descendant of Bharata, (Pandu) gratified Satyavati, Bhishma and the illustrious and amiable princess of Kausalya with the wealth, acquired by his prowess of arms.</p>
<p id='4'>ननन्द माता कौसल्या तमप्रतिमतेजसम्। जयन्तमिव पौलोमी परिष्वज्य नरर्षभम्॥<br />Kausalya, in embracing her son of matchless prowess became as glad as Sachi on embracing Jayanta (her son).</p>
<p id='5'>तस्य वीरस्य विक्रान्तैः सहस्रशतदक्षिणैः। अश्वमैधशतैरीजे धृतराष्ट्रो महामखैः॥<br />Dhritarashtra performed with the wealth acquired by that hero five great sacrifices, in which offerings were made to the Brahmanas by hundreds and thousands and in which so much wealth was spent as would have been sufficient for one hundred Horse sacrifices.</p>
<p id='6'>सम्प्रयुक्तस्तु कुन्त्या च माद्र्या च भरतर्षभ। जिततन्द्रीस्तदा पाण्डुर्बभूव वनगोचरः॥<br />O best of the Bharata race, some time after, Pandu, who had mastered over his senses, retired into a forest with (his wives) Kunti and Madri.</p>
<p id='7'>हित्वा प्रासादनिलयं शुभानि शयनानि च। अरण्यनित्यः सततं बभूव मृगयापरः॥<br />He left his excellent palace and its luxurious bed. He lived always in the forest, being ever engaged in hunting.</p>
<p id='8'>स चरन् दक्षिणं पार्श्व रम्यं हिमवतो गिरेः। उवास गिरिपृष्ठेषु महाशालवनेषु च॥<br />He lived in a delightful and hilly region over grown with huge Shala trees on the southern slope of the Himalayas where he roamed freely.</p>
<p id='9'>रराज कुन्त्या मात्र्या च पाण्डुः सह वने चरन्। करेण्वोरिव मध्यस्थः श्रीमान् पौरंदरो गजः॥<br />The handsome Pandu roamed in the forest with Kunti and Madri like Airavata with two female elephants.</p>
<p id='10'>भारतं सह भार्याभ्यां खड्गबाणधनुर्धरम्। विचित्रकवचं वीरं परमास्त्रविदं नृपम्। देवोऽयमित्यमन्यन्त चरन्तं वनवासिनः॥ तस्य कामांश्च भोगांश्च नरा नित्यमतन्द्रिताः। उपाजहुर्वनान्तेषु धृतराष्ट्रेण चोदिताः॥<br />The dwellers of (that) forest regarded the heroic Bharata prince with his two wives, (Pandu), armed with swords, arrows and bows and encased in beautiful armour, as a god wandering amongst them. The people were busy in supplying every object of pleasure and enjoyment to him in his retirement at the command of Dhritarashtra.</p>
<p id='11'>अथ पारशवीं कन्यां देवकस्य महीपतेः। रूपयौवनसम्पन्नां स शुश्रावायगासुतः॥<br />The son of the river (Bhishma) heard that king Devaka had a daughter, young and beautiful, born in a Shudra wife.</p>
<p id='12'>ततस्तु वरयित्वा तामानीय भरतर्षभः। विवाहं कारयामास विदुरस्य महामतेः॥<br />The best of the Bharata race (Bhishma) brought her from her father's abode and he married her to the high minded Vidura.</p>
<p id='13'>तस्यां चोत्पादयामास विदुरः कुरुनन्दनः। पुत्रान् विनयसम्पन्नानात्मनः सदृशान् गुणैः॥<br />The descendant of Kuru, Vidura, begot on her children as gentle and accomplished as he himself was.</p>
