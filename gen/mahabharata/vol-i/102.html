<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>सम्प्रासयौवनं दृष्ट्वा भ्रातरं धीमतां वरः। भीष्मो विचित्रवीर्यस्य विवाहायाकरोन्मतिम्॥<br />When that best of all intelligent men, Bhishma, saw that his brother Vichitravirya, had attained majority (youth), he thought of marrying him.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>अथ काशिपतेर्भीष्मः कन्यास्तिस्रोऽप्सरोपमाः। शुश्राव सहिता राजन् वृण्वाना वै स्वयंवरम्॥<br />O king, he heard that three daughters of the king of Kashi, all equal to the Apsaras in beauty, would be married at a Sayamvara.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>ततः स रथिनां श्रेष्ठो रथेनैकेन शत्रुजित्। जगामानुमते मातुः पुरीं वाराणसी प्रभुः॥<br />Thereupon, that best of car-warriors, that chastiser of foes, that Lord (Bhishma), riding on a single car, went at the command of his mother to the city of Varanasi (Kashi).</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>तत्र राज्ञः समुदितान् सर्वतः समुपागतान्। ददर्श कन्यास्ताश्चैव भीष्मः शान्तनुनन्दनः॥<br />There the son of Shantanu, Bhishma, saw that many kings and potentates had come from all directions. He also saw those three maidens.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>कीर्त्यमानेषु राज्ञां तु तदा नामसु सर्वशः। (एकाकिनं तदा भीष्मं वृद्धं शान्तनुनन्दनम्॥ सोद्वेगा इव तं दृष्ट्वा कन्याः परमशोभनाः। अपाक्रामन्त ताः सर्वा वृद्ध इत्येव चिन्तया॥ वृद्धः परमधर्मात्मा वलीपलितधारणः। किं कारणमिहायातो निर्लज्जो भरतर्षभः॥ मिथ्याप्रतिज्ञो लोकेषु किं वदिष्यति भारत। ब्रह्मचारीति भीष्मो हि वृथैव प्रथितो भुवि।। इत्येवं प्रब्रुवन्तस्ते हसन्ति स्म नृपाधमाः।<br />When the kings were being mentioned by name, meanwhile there arrived Bhishma alone who had already became an old man. On seeing him, all the extremely beautiful young girls became agitated thinking him to be an old man. Those kings of mean character gathered together over there started talking among themselves and deriding him thus : He has already became an old person. Wrinkles have spread all over his body. The hair on his head has become white. Despite of these signs how came he has arrived here? He is really shameless and by proving his vow untrue, what will he tell the people here. Truly the fact that Bhishma is a calibrate has been spread in vain all the world over.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच क्षत्रियाणां वचः श्रुत्वा भीष्मश्चक्रोध भारत!!) भीष्मस्तदा स्वयं कन्या वरयामास ताः प्रभुः॥ उवाच च महीपालान् राजञ्जलदनिस्वनः। रथमारोप्य ताः कन्या भीष्मः प्रहरतां वरः॥<br />Vaishampayana said : O Bharata, hearing the words of those kings, Bhishma became angry. Bhishma, the lord, chose himself those maidens (for his brother). O king, taking those maidens on his chariot, the best of warriors, Bhishma, spoke to the (assembled) kings in a voice like the thunder of the clouds.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>आहूय दानं कन्यानां गुणवद्भ्यः स्मृतं बुधः। अलंकृत्य यथाशक्ति प्रदाय च धनान्यपि॥ प्रयच्छन्त्यपरे कन्या मिथुनेन गवामपि। वित्तेन कथितेनान्ये बलेनान्येऽनुमान्य च॥ प्रमत्तामुपयन्त्यन्ये स्वयमन्ये च विन्दते।<br />The wise have said that after inviting accomplished man, a maiden may be bestowed on him decked with ornaments and accompanied with valuable presents as much as lie in the power of the bestower to give. Others may bestow their daughters by accepting a couple of kine. Some again may bestow their daughters by taking a fixed sum and some again take away maidens by force. Some marry with the consent of the maidens and some by dragging them into consent. Some by obtaining their parents' consent, some again obtain wives as presents.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>आर्ष विधि पुरस्कृत्य दारान् विन्दन्ति चापरे॥ अष्टमं तमथो वित्त विवाहं कविभिर्वतम्। स्वयंदरं तु राजन्याः प्रशंसन्त्युपयान्ति च॥ प्रमथ्य तु हृतामाहुायसी धर्मवादिनः। ता इमाः पृथिवीपाला जिहीर्षामि बलादितः॥ ते यतध्वं परं शक्त्या विजयायेतराय वा।<br />The learned men praise the eighth form of marriage, but the Svaymavara is highly spoken by the kings. But the sages have said that the wife taken by force amidst an assemblage of kings after defeating them is to be highly prized. Therefore, O kings, I carry away these maidens by force. Try with all your strength to defeat me or be defeated.</p>

Having said this to the kings and the king of Kashi, the greatly powerful. Kuru prince took up those maidens on his car. Having thus taken them on his car and having challenged them (the chiefs) to fight, he sped his chariot away.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>ततस्ते पार्थिवाः सर्वे समुत्पेतुरमर्षिताः॥ संस्पृशन्तः स्वकान् बाहून् दशन्तो दशनच्छदान्।<br />Thereupon all the kings stood up in anger; they slapped their arms and bit their mother lips.</p>

With their brows contracted and eyes red in anger, they moved in impatience, their ornaments and armours dangling with their agitated steps. The charioteers soon brought handsome cars, yoked with fine horses. Those heroes, armed with all kinds of weapons then got on those cars. They pursued the retreating chief of the Kurus. O descendant of the Bharata race, then occurred that wonderful fight. That hair-stirring battle in which innumerable kings were on one side and only one was on the other.</p>

Bhishma, however, stopped their memberless arrows before they could fall upon him by a counter shower of his own arrows as numerous as the down of the body. Thereupon, the kings surrounded him on all sides and rained upon him a shower of arrows like masses of clouds showering on the mountains. He (Bhishma), stopping that shower of arrows by his own, wounded each of the kings with three arrows. O king, the kings wounded Bhishma each with five arrows.</p>

The battle became so fierce with the dense shower of arrows that it looked like the battle between the Devas and the Danavas. And even brave men were struck with fear to look at it. (Bhishma) cut off by his arrows flag staffs, armours and human heads by hundreds and thousands on the field of battle. Such was his prowess and extraordinary lightness of hand, such was the skill with which he protected himself, that the fighting car-warriors, though his enemies, loudly applauded him. That foremost of all experts in arms (Bhishma), having defeated all the kings in battle and having taken the maidens with him, went towards the capital of the Bharatas. O king, then the great car-warrior king, Shalva, challenged from behind the son of Shantanu, Bhishma, to a combat. Desirous of securing the maidens, he came upon Bhishma like a powerful leader of elephants, rushing upon another of its kinds and tearing with its tusk its opponent's thigh at the sight of a female. That mighty armed king Shalva cried in wrath to Bhishma, “Stay, Stay.” Then the best of men, Bhishma that destroyer of hostile army, provoked by his words, flamed up in anger like a blazing fire. Bow in hand, his brow borrowed into wrinkles, he stopped his car in obedience to the Kshatriya usage and stayed there in expectation of the enemy.</p>
