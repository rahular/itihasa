<h3>SAMBHAVA PARVA: Chapter 74</h3><h4>Ilistory of Shakuntala</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच प्रतिज्ञाय तु दुष्यन्ते प्रतियाते शकुन्तलाम्। गर्भं सुषाव वामोरू: कुमारममितौजसम्॥ त्रिषु वर्षेषु पूर्णेषु दीप्तानलसमद्युतिम्। रूपौदार्यगुणोपेतं दौष्यन्ति जनमेजय॥<br />Vaishampayana said : When Dushyanta went away from the hermitage, making the (above) promises to Shakuntala, she gave birth to a boy of immeasurable energy. When the child grew only three years old, he became in splendour as blazing as the blazing fire. O Janamejaya, he was endued with great beauty, magnanimity and all accomplishments.</p>
<p id='2'>जातकर्मादिसंस्कारं कण्वः पुण्यकृतां वरः। विधिवत् कारयामास वर्धमानस्य धीमतः॥<br />The best of pious men, Kanvas, performed all the rites ordained by the scriptures on that intelligent boy who began to grow up day by day.</p>
<p id='3'>दन्तैः शुकैः शिखरिभिः सिंहसंहननो महान्। चक्राङ्कितकरः श्रीमान् महामूर्धा महाबलः॥<br />The boy was gifted with sharp, strong and pearly teeth; he was strong enough to kill lions, he had all auspicious signs on his palms, he had a broad forehead, he was beautiful and strong.</p>
<p id='4'>कुमारो देवगर्भाभः स तत्राशु व्यवर्धत। षड्वर्ष एव बालः स कण्वाश्रमपदं प्रति॥ सिंहव्याघ्रान् वराहांश्च महिषांश्च गजांस्तथा। बबन्ध वृक्षे बलवानाश्रमस्य समीपतः॥<br />Like a celestial child, he began daily to grow up. When he grew six years old, he was so strong that he seized and bound tigers, boars, buffaloes and elephants to the trees that stood near the hermitage.</p>
<p id='5'>आरोहन् दमयंश्चैव क्रीडंश्च परिधावति। ततोऽस्य नाम चक्रुस्ते कण्वाश्रमनिवासिनः॥ अस्त्वयं सर्वदमनः सर्वं हि दमयत्यसौ। स सर्वदमनो नाम कुमारः समपद्यत॥ विक्रमेणौजसा चैव बलेन च समन्वितः।<br />He rode on some of these wild beasts; he seized some of them and sometimes he pursued some of them in playful mood. The dwellers of the hermitage of Kanva, (finding all this), gave him a name. (They said,) “As he subjugated all beasts, let him be called Sarvadamana". Thus the prince came to be called Sarvadamana, endued as he was with great strength, energy and powers.</p>
<p id='6'>तं कुमारमृषिर्दृष्ट्वा कर्म चास्यातिमानुषम्॥ समयो यौवराज्यायेत्यब्रवीच शकुन्तलाम्।<br />Seeing the extraordinary acts of the boy, the Rishi (Kanva) told Shakuntala that the time had come when he should be installed as the heir-apparent.</p>
<p id='7'>तस्य तद् बलमाज्ञाय कण्वः शिष्यानुवाच ह॥ शकुन्तलामिमां शीघ्रं सहपुत्रामितो गृहात्। भर्तुः प्रापयतागारं सर्वलक्षणपूजिताम्॥<br />Seeing the great strength of the boy, Kanva spoke to his disciples thus, "Take Shakuntala with her son from the hermitage to the house of her husband, blessed with all auspicious signs."</p>
<p id='8'>नारीणां चिरवासो हि बान्धवेषु न रोचते। कीर्तिचारित्रधर्मजस्तस्मान्नयत मा चिरम्॥<br />"It is not fit for women to live for ever in the house of their paternal or maternal relations. Such residence destroys their good name, good conduct and virtue. Therefore, take her to her husband's house without delay."</p>
<p id='9'>तथेत्युक्त्वा तु ते सर्वे प्रातिष्ठन्त महौजसः। शकुन्तलां पुरस्कृत्य दुष्यन्तस्य पुरं प्रति॥<br />The greatly effulgent disciples (of Kanva), having promised to do it, started with Shakuntala and her son towards the city of Hastinapur.</p>
<p id='10'>गृहीत्वामरगर्भाभं पुत्रं कमललोचनम्। आजगाम ततः सुभूर्दुष्यन्तं विदिताद् वनात्॥<br />That beauty of fair eye-brows, taking her lotus-eyed son of celestial beauty with her, left the forest where she had first met Dushyanta.</p>
<p id='11'>अभिसृत्य च राजानं विदिता च प्रवेशिता। सह तेनैव पुत्रेण बालार्कसमतेजसा॥<br />Having sent words, she entered the royal court with her son, as effulgent as the morning sun. And she was then introduced to him.</p>
<p id='12'>निवेदयित्वा ते सर्वे आश्रमं पुनरागताः। पूजयित्वा यथान्यायमब्रवीच शकुन्तला॥<br />The disciples of the Rishi, having told the king everything, returned to the hermitage. And Shakuntala, after duly worshipping the</p>
<p id='13'>शकुन्तलोवाच अयं पुत्रस्त्वया राजन् यौवराज्येऽभिषिच्यताम्। त्वया ह्ययं सुतो राजन् मय्युत्पन्नः सुरोपमः। यथासमयमेतस्मिन् वर्तस्व पुरुषोत्तम॥<br />Shakuntala said : O King, this is your son. Let him be installed as your heir-apparent. O King, this god-like boy was begotten by you on me. O best of men, fulfil now the promise you made of me.</p>
<p id='14'>यथा मत्सङ्गमे पूर्वं यः कृतः समयस्त्वया। तं स्मरस्व महाभाग कण्वाश्रमपदं प्रति॥<br />O illustrious man, call to your mind the agreement you made with me on the occasion of our marriage at the hermitage of Kanva.</p>
<p id='15'>सोऽथ श्रुत्वैव तद् वाक्यं तस्या राजा स्मरन्नपि। अब्रवीन्न स्मरामीति कस्य त्वं दुष्टतापसि॥<br />Having heard her words, the King remembered everything, but he said, “I remember nothing. O wicked ascetic woman, to whom do you belong?"</p>
<p id='16'>धर्मकामार्थसम्बन्धं न स्मरामि त्वया सह। गच्छ वा तिष्ठ वा कामं यद् वापीच्छसि तत् कुरु॥<br />"I do not remember to have any connection with you with regard to (either) Dharma, Artha and Kama. Go or stay or do whatever you please."</p>
<p id='17'>सैवमुक्ता वरारोहा वीडितेव तपस्विनी। नि:संज्ञेव च दुःखेन तस्थौ स्थूणेव निश्चला॥<br />Thus being addressed, the beautiful ascetic lady was filled with shame. She lost her consciousness from grief and she stood like a wooden post.</p>
<p id='18'>संरम्भामर्षताम्राक्षी स्फुरमाणौष्ठसम्पुटा। कटाक्षैर्निर्दहन्तीव तिर्यग् राजानमैक्षत॥<br />Soon became her eyes red like copper; her lips began to quiver; she cast upon the king her (angry) glances which seemed to burn him.</p>
<p id='19'>आकारं गूहमानां च मन्युना च समीरिता। तपसा सम्भृतं तेजो धारयामास वै तदा।॥<br />Her rising anger and blazing fire of her asceticism she kept down with a great effort.</p>
<p id='20'>सा मुहूर्तमिव ध्यात्वा दुःखामर्षसमन्विता। भर्तारमभिसम्प्रेक्ष्य क्रुद्धा वचनमब्रवीत्॥ जानन्नपि महाराज कस्मादेवं प्रभाषसे। न जानामीति निःशङ्कं यथान्यः प्राकृतो जनः॥<br />Collecting her thought in a moment, she thus addressed her husband looking straight at him in grief and in anger. “O great king, knowing everything, how can you, like a mean and inferior man, say that you know nothing'?</p>
<p id='21'>अत्र ते हृदयं वेद सत्यस्यैवानृतस्य च। कल्याणं वद साक्ष्येण माऽऽत्मानमवमन्यथाः॥<br />Your heart is the witness to the truth or to the falsehood of my words. Therefore, speak the truth and do not degrade yourself.</p>
<p id='22'>योऽन्यथा सन्तमात्मानमन्यथा प्रतिपद्यते। किं तेन न कृतं पापं चौरेणात्मापहारिणा॥<br />He, who has one thing in his mind, but represents another thing to others, is a thief and a robber of his own self. What sin is he not capable of committing?</p>
<p id='23'>एकोऽहमस्मीति च मन्यसे त्वं न हृच्छयं वेत्सि मुनि पुराणम्। यो वेदिता कर्मणः पापकस्य तस्यान्तिके त्वं वृजिनं करोपि॥<br />You think that you alone know what you did. But do you not know that the great Omniscient One dwells in your heart. He knows all your sins and you sin in his presence.</p>
<p id='24'>मन्यते पापकं कृत्वा न कश्चिद् वेत्ति मामिति। विदन्ति चैनं देवाश्च यश्चैवान्तरपूरुषः॥<br />Man, when sinning, thinks that no one sees him. But he is seen by the celestials and by the Deity who dwells in every heart.</p>
<p id='25'>आदित्यचन्द्रावनिलानलौ च द्यौर्भूमिरापो हृदयं यमश्च। अहश्च रात्रिश्च उभे च संध्ये धर्मश्च जानाति नरस्य वृत्तम्॥<br />The sun, the moon, the air, the fire, the earth, the sky, the water, the heart, Yama, the day, the night, the twilight and Dharma see every act of man.</p>
<p id='26'>यमो वैवस्वतस्तस्य निर्यातयति दुष्कृतम्। हृदि स्थितः कर्मसाक्षी क्षेत्रज्ञो यस्य तुष्यति॥<br />Yama, the son of Vivasvata, takes no account of the sins of that man with whom the Deity, the witness of all acts, remains pleased.</p>
<p id='27'>न तु तुष्यति यस्यैष पुरुषस्य दुरात्मनः। तंयमः पापकर्माणं वियातयति दुष्कृतम्॥<br />But that sinner, with whom the great Deity is not pleased, is punished by Yama for his wicked deeds.</p>
<p id='28'>योऽवमन्यात्मनाऽऽत्मानमन्यथा प्रतिपद्यते। न तस्य देवाः श्रेयांसो यस्यात्मापि न कारणम्॥ स्वयं प्राप्तेति मामेवं मावमंस्थाः पतिव्रताम्। अर्चाहीं नार्चयसि मां स्वयं भार्यामुपस्थिताम्॥<br />He, who falsely represents his self and thus degrades himself, is never blessed by the celestials. Even his own soul does not bless him. I have come of my own accord, but I am a devoted wife to my husband. Do not disrespect me. I am your wife and deserve to be treated respectfully.</p>
<p id='29'>किमर्थं मां प्राकृतवदुपप्रेक्षसि संसदि। न खल्वहमिदं शून्ये रौमि किं न शृणोषि मे॥<br />Why do you treat me before all these men like an ordinary woman? I am certainly not crying in the wilderness. Do you not hear me?</p>
<p id='30'>यदि मे याचमानाया वचनं न करिष्यसि। दुष्यन्त शतधा मूर्धा ततस्तेऽद्य स्फुटिष्यति॥<br />O Dushyanta, If you refuse what I ask you to do, your head will to day be divided into a thousand pieces.</p>
<p id='31'>भार्यां पतिः सम्प्रविश्य स यस्माजायते पुनः। जायायास्तद्धि जायात्वं पौराणाः कवयो विदुः॥<br />The learned men of old say that the husband himself, entering into the womb of his wife, comes out as the son. Therefore, the wife is called Jaya.</p>
<p id='32'>यदागमवतः पुंसस्तदपत्यं प्रजायते। तत् तारयति संतत्या पूर्वप्रेतान् पितामहान्॥<br />The son, that is born to a wise man, rescues the spirits of his deceased ancestors.</p>
<p id='33'>पुत्राम्नो नरकाद् यस्मात् पितरं त्रायते सुतः। तस्मात् पुत्र इति प्रोक्तः स्वयमेव स्वयम्भुवा॥<br />Because the son rescues his ancestors from the hell, called Put, therefore he has been called by the self-created (Brahma) himself as Putra.</p>
<p id='34'>(पुत्रेण लोकाञ्जयति पौत्रेणानन्त्यमश्नुते। अथ पौत्रस्य पुत्रेण मोदन्ते प्रपितामहः।।)<br />A man conquers the world by the birth of a son; he enjoys eternity by that of a grandson; the great grandfathers enjoy eternal happiness by the birth of a grandson's son.</p>
<p id='35'>सा भार्या या गृहे दक्षा सा भार्या या प्रजावती। सा भार्या या पतिप्राणा सा भार्या या पतिव्रता॥<br />She is a true wife who is a good housewife; she is a true wife whose heart is devoted to her husband; she is a true wife who is faithful to her husband,</p>
<p id='36'>अर्धं भार्या मनुष्यस्य भार्या श्रेष्ठतमः सखा। भार्या मूलं त्रिवर्गस्य भार्या मूलं तरिष्यतः॥<br />A man's half is his wife, the wife is her husband's best of friends; the wife is the source of Dharma, Artha and Kama; the wife is the source of salvation.</p>
<p id='37'>भार्यावन्त: क्रियावन्तः सभार्या गृहमेधिनः। भार्यावन्तः प्रमोदन्ते भार्यावन्तः श्रियान्विताः॥<br />Those that have wives can perform religious acts; those that have wives lead domestic lives. Those that have wives can be happy and those that have wives can achieve good fortune.</p>
<p id='38'>सखायः प्रविविक्तेषु भवन्त्येताः प्रियंवदाः। पितरो धर्मकार्येषु भवन्त्यार्तस्य मातरः॥<br />The sweet-speeched wives their husband's friends on the occasion of joy; they are as fathers on occasions of religious acts; they are as mothers in the hours of illness and are woe.</p>
<p id='39'>कान्तारेष्वपि विश्रामो जनस्याध्वनिकस्य वै। यः सदारः स विश्वास्यस्तस्माद् दाराः परागतिः॥४४।<br />Even in the deep forest, the wife is the refreshment and solace to her roaming husband. He who has a wife, is trusted by all. The wife, therefore, is man's great means of salvation.</p>
<p id='40'>संसरन्तमपि प्रेतं विषमेष्वेकपातिनम्। भावान्वेति भर्तारं सततं या पतिव्रता॥<br />When the husband goes to the land of Yama, leaving this world, it is the devoted wife only that accompanies him there.</p>
<p id='41'>प्रथमं संस्थिता भार्या पतिं प्रेत्य प्रतीक्षते। पूर्वं मृतं च भर्तारं पश्चात् साध्व्यनुगच्छति॥<br />The wife, gone before (dying before her husband), waits for the spirit of her husband and if the husband goes before, the chaste wife soon follows him.</p>
<p id='42'>एतस्मात् कारणाद् राजन् पाणिग्रहणमिष्यते। यदाप्नोति पतिर्भार्यामिहलोके परत्र च॥<br />O king, for all these reasons, marriage exists (in this world). The husband enjoys the company of his wife, both here in this world and hereafter.</p>
<p id='43'>आत्माऽऽत्मनैव जनितः पुत्र इत्युच्यते बुधैः। तस्माद् भार्यां नरः पश्येन्मातृवत् पुत्रमातरम्॥<br />The learned men have said that a man himself is born as his son; therefore, a man whose wife has given birth to a son, should look upon her as his mother.</p>
<p id='44'>भार्यायां जनितं पुत्रमादर्शेष्विव चाननम्। ह्लादते जनिता प्रेक्ष्य स्वर्गं प्राप्येव पुण्यकृत्॥<br />Looking at the face of the son, begotten on his wife, a man sees his own face as he does in a mirror; and feels himself as happy as a virtuous man attaining to heaven.</p>
<p id='45'>दह्यमाना मनोदुःखैर्व्याधिभिश्चातुरा नराः। ह्लादन्ते स्वेषु दारेषु धर्मार्ताः सलिलेष्विव॥<br />Men, burnt out by mental grief or afflicted by disease, feel as much relieved in the company of their wives as a perspiring man does in a cool bath.</p>
<p id='46'>सुसंरब्धोऽपि रामाणां न कुर्यादप्रियं नरः। रतिं प्रीतिं च धर्मं च तास्वायत्तमवेक्ष्य हि॥<br />No man, even in anger, should even do any thing that is disagreeable to his wife; for happiness, joy, virtue and everything depend on the wife.</p>
<p id='47'>आत्मनो जन्मनः क्षेत्रं पुण्यं रामाः सनातनम्। ऋषीणामपि का शक्तिः स्रष्टुं रामामृते प्रजाम्॥<br />Wife is the sacred soil in which the husband is born again. Even Rishis cannot create men without women.</p>
<p id='48'>प्रतिपद्य यदा सूनुर्धरणीरेणुगुण्ठितः। पितुराश्लिष्यतेऽङ्गानि किमस्त्यभ्यधिकं ततः॥<br />What is a greater happiness to a father than what the father feels when his son, running to him, clasps him with his (tiny little) arms, though his body is full of dust and dirt?</p>
<p id='49'>स त्वं स्वयमभिप्राप्तं साभिलाषमिमं सुतम्। प्रेक्षमाणं कटाक्षेण किमर्थमवमन्यसे॥ अण्डानि बिभ्रति स्वानि न भिन्दन्ति पिपीलिकाः। न भरेथाः कथं न त्वं धर्मज्ञः सन् स्वमात्मजम्॥<br />Why are you treating with indifference this your son who has himself come to you and who is wistfully casting his glances towards you? Even ants support their off-spring and do not destroy their eggs. Why then should you not, being learned in the rules of piety, support your own child?</p>
<p id='50'>न वाससां न रामाणां नापां स्पर्शस्तथाविधः। शिशोरालिङ्ग्यमानस्य स्पर्शः सूनोर्यथा सुखः॥<br />The touch of the sandal-paste, that of women and water, is not so pleasing as that of one's own infant son, locked in his embrace.</p>
<p id='51'>ब्राह्मणो द्विपदां श्रेष्ठो गौर्वरिष्ठा चतुष्पदाम्। गुरुर्गरीयसां श्रेष्ठः पुत्रः स्पर्शवतां वरः॥<br />As the Brahmana is the best among bipeds (men), as cow is the best among quadrupeds, as preceptor is the best among all superiors, so is the son among all objects pleasing to the touch.</p>
<p id='52'>स्पृशतु त्वां समाश्लिष्य पुत्रोऽयं प्रियदर्शनः। पुत्रस्पर्शात् सुखतरः स्पर्शो लोके न विद्यते॥<br />Let this handsome son touch you in your embrace. There is nothing in the world more pleasing to the touch than that of a son.</p>
<p id='53'>त्रिषु वर्षेषु पूर्णेषु प्रजाताहमरिंदम। इमं कुमारं राजेन्द्र तव शोकविनाशनम्॥ आहर्ता वाजिमेधस्य शतसंख्यस्य पौरव। इति वागन्तरिक्षे मां सूतकेऽभ्यवदत् पुरा॥<br />O chastiser of foes, O great king, I gave birth to this boy, the dispeller of your grief, after the completion of three years. O descendant of the Puru race, when I was in the lying-in room, the following words were uttered in the sky, He shall perform one hundred horse-sacrifices.</p>
<p id='54'>ननु नामाङ्कमारोप्य स्नेहाद् ग्रामान्तरं गताः। मूर्ध्नि पुत्रानुपाघ्राय प्रतिनन्दन्ति मानवाः॥<br />Men, going to places remote from their homes, take up other men's sons on their laps and smelling their heads, feel great happiness.</p>
<p id='55'>वेदेष्वपि वदन्तीमं मन्त्रग्रामं द्विजातयः। जातकर्माणि पुत्राणां तवापि विदितं तथा॥<br />You know that the Brahmanas utter the following Vedic Mantras at the birthday, ceremony of the child.</p>
<p id='56'>अङ्गादङ्गात् सम्भवसि हृदयादधिजायसे। आत्मा वै पुत्रनामासि स जीव शरदः शतम्॥<br />“You are born of my body; you have sprung from my heart. You are myself in the form of my son. Live for one hundred years."</p>
<p id='57'>जीवितं त्वदधीनं मे संतानमपि चाक्षयम्। तस्मात् त्वं जीव मे पुत्र सुसुखी शरदां शतम्॥<br />"My life depends on you. The continuation of my race also depends on you. Therefore, live in happiness for one hundred years."</p>
<p id='58'>त्वदङ्गेभ्यः प्रसूतोऽयं पुरुषात् पुरुषोऽपरः। वै सरसीवामलेऽऽत्मानं द्वितीयं पश्य सुतम्॥<br />He (this boy) has sprung from your body, he is a second being begotten from you. Behold your own self in your own son, as you see your image in the clear waters of the lake.</p>
<p id='59'>यथा ह्याहवनीयोऽग्निर्गार्हपत्यात् प्रणीयते। तथा त्वत्तः प्रसूतोऽयं त्वमेकः सन् द्विधा कृतः॥ मृगावकृष्टेन पुरा मृगयां परिधावता। अहमासादिता राजन् कुमारी पितुराश्रमे॥<br />As the sacrificial fire is kindled from the domestic fire, so has this one (your son), sprung from you. Though you are one, you have divided yourself in two. O king, in your hunting expedition, I was approached by you when I was a virgin in my father's hermitage.</p>
<p id='60'>उर्वशी पूर्वचित्तिश्च सहजन्या च मेनका। विश्वाची च घृताची च षडेवाप्सरसां वराः॥<br />Urvashi, Purvachitti, Sahajanya, Menaka, Vishvachi and Ghritachi, these are the six foremost Apsaras.</p>
<p id='61'>तासां सा मेनका नाम ब्रह्मयोनिर्वराप्सराः। दिवः सम्प्राप्य जगतीं विश्वामित्रादजीजनत्॥<br />Amongst them again, Menaka, born of a Brahmana, is the first. Descending from heaven on earth, she gave me birth from her association with Vishvamitra.</p>
<p id='62'>सा मां हिमवतः प्रस्थे सुषुवे मनेकाप्सराः। अवकीर्य च मां याता परात्मजमिवासती॥<br />The Apsara Menaka gave me birth in a valley of the Himalayas. Devoid of affections, she went away, leaving me there, as if I was a child of some others.</p>
<p id='63'>किं नु कर्माशुभं पूर्वं कृतवत्यन्यजन्मनि। यदहं बान्धवैस्त्यक्ता बाल्ये सम्प्रति च त्वया।॥<br />What great sin did I commit of old in some other life that I was cast away by my parents in my infancy and now I am cast away by you?</p>
<p id='64'>कामं त्वया परित्यक्ता गमिष्यामि स्वमाश्रमम्। इमं तु बालं संत्यक्तुं नार्हस्यात्मजमात्मनः॥<br />Cast off from you, I am ready to go back to the hermitage. But you should not cast off this child who is your own son.</p>
<p id='65'>दुष्यन्त उवाच न पुत्रमभिजानामि त्वयि जातं शकुन्तले। असत्यवचना नार्यः कस्ते श्रद्धास्यते वचः॥ मेनका निरनुक्रोशा बन्धकी जननी तव। यया हिमवतः पृष्ठे निर्माल्यमिव चोज्झिता॥<br />Dushyanta said : O Shakuntala, I do not know that I begot this child on you. Women generally speak falsehood. Who will believe your words? Your mother is lewd Menaka, destitute of affection; she cast off you in the valley of the Himalayas as one casts off the flowers after offering them to the gods.</p>
<p id='66'>स चापि निरनुक्रोशः क्षत्रयोनिः पिता तव। विश्वामित्रो ब्राह्मणत्वे लुब्धः कामवशं गतः॥<br />Your father also is lustful Vishvamitra of the Kshatriya race, destitute of all affection, the ! man who was tempted to become a Brahmana.</p>
<p id='67'>मेनकाप्सरसां श्रेष्ठा महर्षीणां पिता च ते। तयोरपत्यं कस्मात् त्वं पुंश्चलीव प्रभाषसे॥<br />But (if you say), Menaka is the foremost of Apsaras and Vishvamitra is the foremost of Rishis, why then do you, being their daughter, speak like a lewd woman?</p>
<p id='68'>अश्रद्धेयमिदं वाक्यं कथयन्ती न लजसे। विशेषतो मत्सकाशे दुष्टतापसि गम्यताम्॥<br />Your these words deserve no credence. Are you not ashamed to utter them, specially before me? Go away, O wicked ascetic woman.</p>
<p id='69'>व महर्षिः स चैवाग्र्यः साप्सराः क्व च मेनका। क्व च त्वमेवं कृपणा तापसीवेषधारिणी॥<br />Where is now that best of great Rishis (Vishvamitra) and that best of Apsaras Menaka? And where are you, (though) in the humble garb of ascetics.</p>
<p id='70'>अतिकायश्च ते पुत्रो बालोऽतिबलवानयम्। कथमल्पेन कालेन शालस्तम्भ इवोद्गतः॥<br />Your this son is very big and appears to be very strong. How has he, within so short time, grown up like a Sala sprout?</p>
<p id='71'>सुनिकृष्टा च ते योनिः पुंश्चलीव प्रभाषसे। यदृच्छया कामरागाजाता मेनकया ह्यसि॥<br />You are born very low, you speak also like a lewd woman. You were lustfully conceived by Menaka.</p>
<p id='72'>सर्वमेतत् परोक्षं मे यत् त्वं वदसि तापसि। नाहं त्वामभिजानामि यथेष्टं गम्यतां त्वया॥<br />O ascetic woman, all that you say is quite unknown to me. I do not know you. Go away wherever you please.</p>
<p id='73'>शकुन्तलोवाच राजन् सर्पपमात्राणि परच्छिद्राणि पश्यसि। आत्मनो बिल्वमात्राणि पश्यन्नपि न पश्यसि॥<br />Shakuntala said: O king, you (can) see the faults of others, though they may be as small as the mustard seed. But you can not see your own faults, though they are as big as the Bilva fruit.</p>
<p id='74'>मेनका त्रिदशेष्वेव त्रिदशाश्चानु मेनकाम्। ममैवोद्रिच्यते जन्म दुष्यन्त तव जन्मनः॥<br />Menaka is a celestial, (nay) Menaka is considered to be the best of celestial. O Dushyanta, my birth is noble than your own.</p>
<p id='75'>क्षितावटसि राजेन्द्र अन्तरिक्षे चराम्यहम्। आवयोरन्तरं पश्य मेरुसर्षपयोरिव॥<br />O great king, you walk on earth, but I roam in the sky. Know that the difference between you and me is like that of a mustard seed and the Meru (mountain).</p>
<p id='76'>महेन्द्रस्य कुबेरस्य यमस्य वरुणस्य च। भवनान्यनुसंयामि प्रभावं पश्य मे नृप॥<br />O king, behold, I can go to the abodes of Indra, Kubera, Yama and Varuna.</p>
<p id='77'>सत्यश्चापि प्रवादोऽयं यं प्रवक्ष्यामि तेऽनघ। निदर्शनार्थं न द्वेषाच्छ्रुत्वा तं क्षन्तुमर्हसि॥<br />O sinless man, there is a proverb which I am going to mention to you; (but I am not doing it) from any evil motive, but only as an example. Therefore, kindly pardon me for referring to it.</p>
<p id='78'>विरूपो यावदादर्श नात्मनः पश्यते मुखम्। मन्यते तावदात्मानमन्येभ्यो रूपवत्तरम्॥<br />The ugly man, until he sees his face in a mirror, considers himself more handsome than others.</p>
<p id='79'>यदा स्वमुखमादर्श विकृतं सोऽभिवीक्षते। तदान्तरं विजानीते आत्मानं चेतरं जनम्।। ८८<br />But when he sees his own face in the mirror, it is then that he perceives the difference between himself and others.</p>
<p id='80'>अतीवरूपसम्पन्नो न कंचिदवमन्यते। अतीव जल्पन् दुर्वाचो भवतीह विहेठकः॥<br />He, who is really very handsome, never taunts others. He, who too much vilifies others, is only considered to be a reviler.</p>
<p id='81'>मूतॊ हि जल्पतां पुंसां श्रुत्वा वाचः शुभाशुभाः। अशुभं वाक्यमादत्ते पुरीषमिव सूकरः॥<br />As the swine seeks for the dirt and filth even when it is in a flower-garden, so does a wicked man chose only evil out of the evil and the good that others speak.</p>
