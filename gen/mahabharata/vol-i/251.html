<h3>None: Chapter 17</h3><h4>confinued. The birth of Jarasandha</h4><p id='1'>वासुदेव उवाच जातस्य भारते वंशे तथा कुन्त्याः सुतस्य च। या वै युक्ता मतिः सेयमर्जुनेन प्रदर्शिता॥<br />Krishna said Arjuna has shown what should be the inclination of one born in the Bharata race, specially of one who is the son of Kunti.</p>
<p id='2'>न स्म मृत्यु विद्म रात्रौ वा यदि वा दिवा। न चापि कंचिदमरमयुद्धेनानुशुश्रुम॥<br />We do not know when death will overtake us, whether in the night or in the day; nor have we heard the immortality has been obtained by desisting from battle.</p>
<p id='3'>एतावदेव पुरुषैः कार्य हृदयतोषणम्। नयेन विधिदृष्टेन यदुपक्रमते परान्॥<br />Therefore, the duty of a man (a hero) is to attack all enemies with the help of the policy indicated in the ordinance. This always gives satisfaction to the heart.</p>
<p id='4'>सुनयस्यानपायस्य संयोगे परमः क्रमः। संगत्या जायतेऽसाम्यं साम्यं च न भवेद् द्वयोः॥<br />If aided by good policy, and if not frustrated by destiny, an undertaking is sure to be crowned with success. If both the parties are aided by such means, and if they fight with each other, one must get the better of the other, for both cannot win or lose.</p>
<p id='5'>अनयस्यानुपायस्य संयुगे परमः क्षयः। संशयो जायते साम्याज्जयश्च न भवेद् द्वयोः॥<br />If aided by bad policy which is destitute of all well-known arts, a man is sure to be defeated and meet with destruction. If, however, both parties are equally circumstance, the result becomes doubtful, but booth cannot win.</p>
<p id='6'>ते वयं नयमास्थाय शत्रुदेहसमीपगाः। कथमन्तं न गच्छेम वृक्षस्येव नदीरयाः। पररन्ध्र पराक्रान्ताः स्वरन्ध्रावरणे स्थिताः॥<br />When such is the case, why should we not, with the aid of good policy, go to the enemy and kill him as a river uproots a tree? if hiding our own drawbacks and taking advantage of his holes (faults), we attack the enemy, why should we not be successful?</p>
<p id='7'>व्यूढानीकैरतिबलैर्न युद्ध्येदरिभिः सह। इति बुद्धिमतां नीतिस्तन्ममापीह रोचते॥<br />It is the policy of all intelligent men that one should fight with enemies who are exceedingly powerful and who stand at the head of their well-arrayed forces. It is my opinion also.</p>
<p id='8'>अनवद्या ह्यसम्बुद्धाः प्रविष्टाः शत्रुसद्म तत्। शत्रुदेहमुपाक्रम्य तं कामं प्राप्नुयामहे॥<br />If we can accomplish our purpose by secretly entering the abode of our enemy and attacking his person, we shall never meet with obloquy.</p>
<p id='9'>एको ह्येव श्रियं नित्यं बिभर्ति पुरुषर्षभः। अन्तरात्मेव भूतानां तत्क्षणं नैव लक्षये॥<br />That best of men (Jarasandha) alone enjoys unfading prosperity like him who is inner-soul of every created being. But I see his destruction (before me).</p>
<p id='10'>अथवैनं निहत्याजौ शेषेणापि समाहताः। प्राप्नुयाम ततः स्वर्ग ज्ञातित्राणपरायणाः॥<br />Desirous as we are of protecting our relatives we shall either kill him, in battle or being ourselves killed by him we shall ascend to heaven.</p>
<p id='11'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच कृष्ण कोऽयं जरासंधः किंवीर्यः किम्पराक्रमः। यस्त्वां स्पृष्टवाग्निसदृशं न दग्धः शलभो यथा॥<br />Yudhishthira said O Krishna, who is this Jarasandha? What is his might, and what is his prowess that he has not been burnt by touching you as a insect is burnt at the touch of fire?</p>
<p id='12'>कृष्ण उवाच शृणु राजञ्जरासंधो यद्वीर्यो यत्पराक्रमः। यथा चोपेक्षितोऽस्माभिबहुशः कृतविप्रियः॥<br />Krishna said O king, hear who is Jarasandha, what is his might and prowess, and why he has been spared by us, though he repeatedly offended us.</p>
<p id='13'>अक्षौहिणीनां तिसृणां पतिः समरदर्पितः। राजा बृहद्रथो नाम मगधाधिपतिर्बली॥<br />There was a king, named Brihadratha who was the heroic lord of Magadha. He was proud in battle battle and had any army of three Akshauhinis of soldiers,</p>
<p id='14'>रूपवान् वीर्यसम्पन्नः श्रीमानतुलविक्रमः। नित्यं दीक्षाङ्किततनुः शतक्रतुरिवापरः॥<br />He was handsome, mighty, wealthy and matchlessly powerful. He always bore (sacrificial) marks on his person and looked like a second Shakra (Indra).</p>
<p id='15'>तेजसा सूर्यसंकाशः क्षमया पृथिवीसमः। यमान्तकसमः क्रोधे श्रिया वैश्रवणोयमः॥<br />He was like Surya in glory, like earth in patience, like the destroyer Yama in anger and like Vaishravana (Kubera) in wealth.</p>
<p id='16'>तस्याभिजनसंयुक्तैर्गुणैर्भरतसत्तम। व्याप्तेयं पृथिवी सर्वा सूर्यस्येव गभस्तिभिः॥<br />O best of the Bharata race, as the rays of the sun (covers the whole earth), so the whole carth was covered by his merits which descended to him from a long line of ancestors.</p>
<p id='17'>स काशिराजस्य सुते यमजे भरतर्षभ। उपयेमे महावीर्यो रूपद्रविणसंयुते। तयोश्चकार समयं मिथः स पुरुषर्षभः॥ नातिवर्तिष्य इत्येवं पत्नीभ्यां संनिधौ तदा। स ताभ्यां शुशुभे राजा पत्नीभ्यां वसुधाधिपः॥ प्रियाभ्यामनुरूपाभ्यां करेणुभ्यामिव द्विपः। तयोर्मध्यगतश्चापि रराज वसुधाधिपः॥ गङ्गायमुनयोर्मध्ये मूर्तिमानिव सागरः। विषयेषु निमग्नस्य तस्य यौवनमभ्यगात्॥<br />O best of the Bharata race, that greatly powerful hero married the two beautiful twindaughters of the king of Kashi. That best of men made an engagement in secret with his two wives, namely that he would equally love them both, and that he would never show a preference for any of them. Like a mighty elephant in the company of two femaleelephants, or like the ocean in his personified form in the company of the Ganga and the Yamuna, that lord of the earth passed his days in joy in the company of his two wives, both of whom suited him well. His youth passed away in the enjoyment of his wealth.</p>
<p id='18'>न च वंशकरः पुत्रस्तस्याजायत कश्चन। मङ्गलैर्बहुभिर्होमैः पुत्रकामाभिरिष्टिभिः। नाससाद नृपश्रेष्ठः पुत्रं कुलविवर्धनम्॥<br />No son was (however) born to him to perpetuate his line; though he performed many auspicious rites, Homas, and sacrifices with the desire of getting a son, yet that best of men did not get a son who could perpetuate his line.</p>
<p id='19'>अथ काक्षीवतः पुत्रं गौतमस्य महात्मनः। शुश्राव तपसि श्रान्तमुदारं चण्डकौशिकम्॥ यदृच्छयाऽऽगतं तं तु वृक्षमूलमुपाश्रितम्। पत्नीभ्यां सहितो राजा सर्वरत्नैरतोषयत्॥<br />He heard one day that the illustrious Chandakaushika, the son of Kakshivana of the Goutama race, having been tired of ascetic penances, have come to his city in his wandering at pleasure, and that he sat under a tree. The king with his wives gratified the Rishi with presents of Jewels.</p>
<p id='20'>तमब्रवीत् सत्यधृतिः सत्यवागृषिसत्तमः। परितुष्टोऽस्मि राजेन्द्र वरं वरय सुव्रत॥<br />That best of Rishis ever truthful in speech and firmly devoted to truth, thus spoke to him (the king), “O king of kings I have been much gratified. O hero of excellent vows, ask from me a boon.</p>

I am unfortunate, (for not having a son), what shall I do with the kingdom or with a boon?</p>

<p id='29'>ते तदानं द्विधा कृत्वा भक्षयामासतुः शुभे। भावित्वादपि चार्थस्य सत्यवाक्यतया मुनेः॥ गर्भः फलप्राशनसम्भवः। ते च दृष्ट्वा स नृपतिः परां मुदमवाप ह॥<br />His two beautiful wives ate the mango, dividing it into two equal parts. In consequence of the certainty of the Muni's words and his truthfulness both of them conceived as an effect of their having eaten that fruit. Seeing them in that state, the king was filled with great joy.</p>
<p id='30'>अथ काले महाप्राज्ञ यथासमयमागते। प्रजायेतामुभे राजञ्छरीरशकले तदा॥<br />O greatly wise (king), sometime after when the (proper) season came, each of the two queens brought forth two fragmentary bodies.</p>

<p id='44'>राक्षस्युवाच बृहद्रथ सुतस्तेऽयं मया दत्तः प्रगृह्यताम्। तव पत्नीद्वये जातो द्विजातिवरशासनात्। धात्रीजनपरित्यक्तो मयायं परिरक्षितः॥<br />The Rakshasi Said O Brihadratha, this is your son. It is given to you by me. Take it. It is born in the wombs of your two wives in consequence of the boon granted to you by the Brahmana. It was abandoned by the midwives, but it was protected by me.</p>
