<p id='10'>नादेन रिपुसैन्यानां येषां संज्ञा प्रणश्यति। स तं नानापताकाभिः शोभितं रथसत्तमम्॥ प्रदक्षिणमुपावृत्य दैवतेभ्यः प्रणम्य च। संनद्धः कवची खङ्गी बद्धगोधाङ्गुलित्रकः॥<br />Whose roars caused the soldiers of the enemy's army to faint away. Then walking round that excellent car adorned with various flags and banners and bowing to the celestial, Arjuna, attired in armour, armed with sword and his fingers increased in leather, ascended it as a virtuous man (on a celestial car that takes him to heaven).</p>
<p id='11'>आरुरोह तदा पार्थो विमानं सुकृती यथा। तच्च दिव्यं धनुः श्रेष्ठं ब्रह्मणा निर्मितं पुरा॥ गाण्डीवमुपसंगृह्य बभूव मुदितोऽजुनः। हुताशनं पुरस्कृत्य ततस्तदपि वीर्यवान्॥ जग्राह बलमास्थाय ज्यया च युयुजे धनुः। मौ। तु योज्यमानायां बलिना पाण्डवेन ह॥ येऽशृण्वन् कूजितं तत्र तेषां वै व्यथितं मनः।<br />Taking upto that celestial and the best of all bows, that which was created by Brahma in days of yore and which was called Gandiva, Arjuna became exceedingly glad.

<p id='16'>ततः पावकमबूतां प्रहृष्टावर्जुनाच्युतौ। कृतास्त्रौ शस्त्रसम्पन्नौ रथिनौ ध्वजिनावपि॥ कल्यौ स्वो भगवन् योद्धमपि सर्वैः सुरासुरैः। किं पुनर्वज्रिणैकेन पन्नगार्थे युयुत्सता॥<br />Then Arjuna and Achyuta (Krishna) thus spoke to Agni in joy, “O illustrious one, furnished ass we are now with great weapons and well conversant with their use and possessed as we are of cars with flats and flatstaff, we are now able to fight even with all the celestial and the Asuras put together, not to speak of the wielder of thunder (Indra) who desire to fight for the sake of the Naga Takshaka.</p>
<p id='17'>अर्जुन उवाच चक्रपाणिर्हषीकेशो विचरन् युधि वीर्यवान्। चक्रेण भस्मसात् सर्वं विसृष्टेन तु वीर्यवान्। त्रिषु लोकेषु तन्नास्ति यन्न कुर्याज्जनार्दनः॥ गाण्डीवं धनुरादाय तथाक्षय्ये महेषुधी। अहमप्युत्सहे लोकान् विजेतुं युधि पावक॥<br />Arjuna said : O Agni, when the greatly powerful Hrishikesha Krishna moves on the field of battle with this discuss in hand, there is nothing in the three worlds which he is not able to consume by hurling his weapon.
