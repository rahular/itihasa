<h3>SAMBHAVA PARVA: Chapter 76</h3><h4>History of Yayati</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>जनमेजय उवाच ययातिः पूर्वजोऽस्माकं दशमो यः प्रजापतेः। कथं स शुक्रतनयां लेभे परमदुर्लभाम्॥ एतदिच्छाम्यहं श्रोतुं विस्तरेण तपोधन। आनुपूर्व्या च मे शंस राज्ञो वंशकरान् पृथक्॥<br />Janamejaya said : How did our ancestor (Yayati) who was the tenth from Prajapati, obtain the unobtainable daughter of Shukra? O great ascetic, I desire to hear this in detail. Tell me also separately the account of those kings who were the founders of dynasties.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच ययातिरासीनृपतिर्देवराजसमद्युतिः। तं शुक्रवृषपर्वाणौ वब्राते वै यथा पुरा॥ तत् तेऽहं सम्प्रवक्ष्यामि पृच्छते जनमेजय। देवयान्याश्च संयोगं ययाते हुषस्य च॥<br />Vaishampayana said : O Janamejaya, the king Yayati was as effulgent as Indra himself. I shall tell you in reply to your question how Shukra and Vrishaparva bestowed (on the king) their daughters in due rites and I shall specially narrate how the union of the Nahusha, took place with Devayani.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>सुराणामसुराणां च समजायत वै मिथः। ऐश्वर्य प्रति संघर्षस्त्रैलोक्ये सचराचरे॥<br />In the days of yore, great battles were often faught between the Devas and the Asuras for the sovereignty over the three worlds.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>जिगीषया ततो देवा वव्रिरेऽऽङ्गिरसं मुनिम्। पौरोहित्येन याज्यार्थे काव्यं तूशनसं परे॥ ब्राह्मणौ तावुभौ नित्यममन्योन्यस्पर्धिनौ भृशम्। तत्र देवा निजघ्नुर्यान् दानवान् युधि संगतान्॥ तान् पुनर्जीवयामास काव्यो विद्याबलाश्रयात्। ततस्ते पुनरुत्थाय योधयांचक्रिरे सुरान्॥<br />From the desire of securing victory, the celestials appointed the Rishi who was the son of Angirasa (Brihaspati) as their priest to conduct their sacrifices; and their opponents appointed Ushanas (Shukra) as their priest for the same purpose. There was much boastful rivalry between these two Brahmanas. All those Danavas that were killed in battle by the Devas were revived by that sage (Shukra) with the power of his knowledge; and they, thus being made alive, fought again with the celestial.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>असुरास्तु निजघ्नुर्यान् सुरान् समरमूर्धनि। न तान् संजीवयामास बृहस्पतिरुदारधीः॥<br />The Asuras also killed many Devas, but the greatly learned Brihaspati could not revive them.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>न हि वेद स तां विद्यां यां काव्यो वेत्ति वीर्यवान्। संजीविनी ततो देवा विषादमगमन् परम्॥<br />He did not know the science of Sanjivini (giving life to the dead) which the greatly powerful Rishi (Shukra) knew very well. The celestial were, therefore, very sorry.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>ते त देवा भयोद्विग्ना: काव्यादुशनसस्तदा। ऊचुः कथमुपागम्य ज्येष्ठं पुत्रं बृहस्पतेः॥<br />Thereupon, the celestials, in great anxiety and in fear of the learned Ushanas, went to Kacha, the eldest son of Brihaspati; and they spoke to him thus.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>भजमानान् भजस्वास्मान् कुरु नः साह्यमुत्तमम्। था सा विद्या निवसति ब्राह्मणेऽमिततेजसि॥<br />"We ask for your protection, we worship you. Help us in a work which we consider as very important. The knowledge of that science which is known to that Brahmana of immeasurable prowess. Shukra, must be obtained by you as soon as possible. You will then be a sharer with us in all sacrificial offerings. You shall find that Brahmana (Shukra) in the court of (king) Vrishaparva.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>रक्षते दानवांस्तत्र न स रक्षत्यदानवान्। तमाराधयितुं शक्तो भवान् पूर्ववयाः कविम्॥<br />He always protects the Danavas, but never the celestials, their opponents. You are younger than he and you are, therefore, able to revere him.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>देवयानी च दयितां सुतां तस्य महात्मनः। त्वमाराधयितुं शक्तो नान्यः कश्चन विद्यते॥<br />You can also adore Devayani, the favourite daughter of that illustrious man. You are capable of conciliating them both. There is none else who can do it.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>शीलदाक्षिण्यमाधुर्यैराचारेण दमेन च। देवयान्यां हि तुष्टायां विद्यां तां प्राप्स्यसि ध्रुवम्॥<br />"You are sure to obtain that knowledge (of Sanjivini from the Rishi) by gratifying Devayani with your conduct, liberality, sweetness and general behaviour.”</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>तथेत्युक्त्वा ततः प्रायाद् बृहस्पतिसुत: कचः। तदाभिपूजिता देवैः समीपे वृषपर्वणः॥<br />Having been thus addressed and worshipped by the celestials, he said, “Be it so." He then went to the court of king Vrishaparva.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>स गत्वा त्वरितो राजन् देवैः सम्प्रेषित: कचः। असुरेन्द्रपुरे शुक्रं दृष्ट्वा वाक्यमुवाच ह॥<br />O king, having been thus sent by the celestials, Kacha soon came to the city of the king of the Asuras; and seeing Shukra there, he thus addressed him.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>ऋषेरङ्गिरस: पौत्रं पुत्रं साक्षाद् बृहस्पतेः। नाम्ना कचमिति ख्यातं शिष्यं गृह्णातु मां भवान्॥<br />“Reverend Sir, accept me as your disciple. I am the grandson of Rishi Angirasa and the son of Brihaspati. I am known as Kacha by naine.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>ब्रह्मचर्य चरिष्यामि त्वय्यहं परमं गुरौ। अनुमन्यस्व मां ब्रह्मन् सहस्रं परिवत्सरान्॥<br />Accepting you as my great preceptor, I shall practise Brahmacharya for one thousand years. Therefore, command me.</p>

<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच कचस्तु तं तथेत्युक्त्वा प्रतिजग्राह तद् व्रतम्। आदिष्टं कविपुत्रेण शुक्रेणोशनसा स्वयम्॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Commanded by the son of Kavi, Ushanas, also called Shukra, Kacha said, “Be it so." And he rook the vow he spoke of.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>व्रतस्य प्राप्तकालं स यथोक्तं प्रत्यगृह्णत। आराधयन्नुपाध्यायं देवयानी च भारत॥ नित्यमाराधयिष्यंस्तौ युवा यौवनगोचरे। गायन् नृत्यन् वादयंश्च देवयानीमतोषयत्॥<br />O descendant of the Bharata race, (Kacha) took the vow he had spoken of at the proper time and began to worship his preceptor (Shukra) and Devayani. That youth (Kacha) daily gratified Devayani who was also in her youth with singing, dancing and playing on various kinds of instruinents.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>स शीलयन् देवयानी कन्यां सम्प्राप्तयौवनाम्। पुष्पैः फलैः प्रेषणैश्च तोषयामास भारत॥<br />O descendant of the Bharata race, he gratified that maiden, Devayani, who was in her youth, with the presentations of flowers and fruits and serving her as an obedient servant.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>देवयान्यपि तं विप्रं नियमव्रतधारणम्। गायन्ती च ललन्ती च रहः पर्यचरत् तथा॥<br />And Devayani also, when they were alone, gratified that vow-observing youth (Kacha) with her songs and sweetness of manners.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>पञ्चवर्षशतान्येवं कचस्य चरतो व्रतम्। तत्रातीयुरथो बुद्ध्वा दानवास्तं ततः कचम्॥ गा रक्षन्तं वने दृष्ट्वा रहस्येकममर्षिताः। जघ्नुर्वृहस्पतेद्वेषाद् विद्यारक्षार्थमेव च॥<br />When five hundreds years had thus passed away of his vow, the Danavas came to know his intention. One day the Danavas saw Kacha when he was tending (his preceptor's) kine. They then killed him out of the hatred they bore against Brihaspati and from the desire of saving the knowledge of Sanjivini.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>हत्वा शालावृकेभ्यश्च प्रायच्छल्लवशः कृतम्। ततो गावो निवृत्तास्ता अगोपा: स्वं निवेशनम्॥<br />They hacked him to pieces and gave his body to be devoured by jackals and wolves. The kine returned to the fold without the cowherd (Kacha).</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>सा दृष्ट्वा रहिता गाश्च कचेनाभ्यागता वनात्। उवाच वचनं काले देवयान्यथ भारत॥<br />O descendant of the Bharata race, when Devayani saw that the kine had returned</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>देवयान्युवाच आहुतं चाग्निहोत्रं ते सूर्यश्चास्तं गतः प्रभो। अगोपाचागता गावः कचस्तात न दृश्यते॥<br />Devayani said: O sire, the Agnihotra (evening fire) is kindled, the sun has also set. The kine have come back without their cowherd. But Kacha is not to be seen.</p>

<p id='27'><a href='#27'></a>भित्त्वा भित्त्वा शरीराणि वृकाणां स विनिर्गत:। आहूतः प्रादुरभवत् कचो हृष्टोऽथ विद्यया॥<br />Having been thus summoned, Kacha appeared in joy, tearing the bodies of the wolves (that had devoured him.)</p>

All the kine also were staying under the shade of that tree.</p>
<p id='29'><a href='#29'></a>असुरास्तत्र मां दृष्ट्वा कस्त्वमित्यभ्यचोदयन्। बृहस्पतिसुतश्चाहं कच इत्यभिविश्रुतः॥<br />The Asuras, having seen me there, asked me, “Who are you?” They heard my this reply, "I am Kacha, the son of Brihaspati."</p>
<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>इत्युक्तमात्रे मां हत्वा पेषीकृत्वा तु दानवाः। दत्त्वा शालावृकेभ्यस्तु सुखं जग्मुः स्वमालयम्॥<br />As soon as I said this, those Danavas killed me and having hacked my body to pieces, they gave it to jackals and wolves. They then went to their homes in joy.</p>
<p id='31'><a href='#31'></a>आहूतो विद्यया भद्रे भार्गवेण महात्मना। त्वत्समीपमिहायातः कथंचित् समजीवितः॥<br />"O amiable lady, summoned by the illustrious Bhargava (your father), I have somehow or other come before you having been made alive."</p>

They again killed him, (pounded him to powders) and mixed him with the waters of the ocean.</p>
<p id='33'><a href='#33'></a>चिरं गतं पुन: कन्या पित्रे तं संन्यवेदयत्। विप्रेण पुनराहूतो विद्यया गुरुदेहजः। पुनरावृत्य तद् वृत्तं न्यवेदयत तद् यथा॥<br />Finding him again late in coming home, that maiden again told her father what had happened. Having been again summoned by that Brahmana (Shukra) to come home, Kacha appeared before the daughter of his preceptor. He again repeated to her all that had happened to him.</p>
<p id='34'><a href='#34'></a>ततस्तृतीयं हत्वा तं दग्ध्वा कृत्वा च चूर्णशः। प्रायच्छन् ब्राह्मणायैव सुरायामसुरास्तदा।॥<br />They killed him for the third time. And having reduced him to ashes by burning, they mixed those ashes with the wine which they offered to the Brahmana (Shukra).</p>

Though again and again revived by my knowledge, he is often killed. What shall I do? O Devayani, do not grieve, do not weep. One like you should not grieve for one who is mortal. You are worshipped by Brahma, by Brahmanas, the celestials with (their king) Indra, the Vasus, the Ashvinis, the Asuras and by the whole universe. It is impossible to keep him alive. For every time I revive him he is killed (by the Danavas).</p>

O Brahman, when you are present, how is possible for the Asura Maya (the power of the Asuras) to overcome the Brahma Maya (the power of the Brahmanas)?</p>
