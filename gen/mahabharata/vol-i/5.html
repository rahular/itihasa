<p id='6'>निगदामि यथायुक्तं पुराणाश्रयसंयुतम्। भृगुर्महर्षिर्भगवान् ब्रह्मणा वै स्वयंभुवा॥ वरुणस्य क्रतौ जातः पावकादिति नः श्रुतम्। भृगोः सुदयितः पुत्रश्च्यवनो नाम भार्गवः॥<br />I shall properly relate, O great Rishi, the history of this race, as it is in the Puranas.

<p id='12'>तस्मिन् गर्भेऽथ संभूते पुलोमायां भृगूद्वह। समये समशीलिन्यां धर्मपत्न्यां यशस्विनः॥ अभिषेकाय निष्क्रान्ते भृगौ धर्मभृतां वरे। आश्रमं तस्य रक्षोऽथ पुलोमाभ्याजगाम ह॥<br />When the virtuous and chaste Pauloma was in that condition, one day the greatly famous and virtuous Bhrigu, leaving her at home, went to perform his ablutions. And it was then that a Rakshasa, named Puloma, came to the Rishi's hermitage.</p>
<p id='13'>तं प्रविश्याश्रमं दृष्ट्वा भृगोर्भार्यामनिन्दिताम्। हृच्छयेन समाविष्टो विचेताः समपद्यत॥<br />He, having entered into the hermitage, saw the irreproachable wife of Bhrigu. Seeing her he was filled with lust and lost his reason.</p>

And in fact that lady of captivating smiles, was formerly betrothed to the Rakshasa by her father.</p>
<p id='17'>तां तु प्रादात्पिता पश्चाद् भृगवे शास्त्रवत्तदा। तस्य तत्किल्बिषं नित्यं हृदि वर्तति भार्गव॥<br />But he afterwards gave her away to the Rishi Bhrigu in due rites. Since then, O descendant of the Bhrigu race, this wound rankled deep in the heart of the Rakshasa.</p>
<p id='18'>इदमन्तरमित्येवं हर्तुं चक्रे मनस्तदा। अथाग्निशरणेऽपश्यज्ज्वलन्तं जातवेदसम्॥<br />He thought this very good opportunity to carry the lady away. Then he entered into the room of the holy fire where it was brightly burning.</p>
<p id='19'>तमपृच्छत्ततो रक्षः पावकं ज्वलितं तदा। शंस मे कस्य भार्येयमग्ने पृच्छे ऋतेन वै॥<br />The Rakshasa asked the burning fire, “O Agni! tell me whose rightful wife this lady is.</p>

<p id='22'>तथा सत्यं समाख्याहि जिहीर्षाम्याश्रमादिमाम्। समन्युस्तत्र हृदयं प्रदहन्निव तिष्ठति। मत्पूर्वाभार्यां यदिमां भृगुराप सुमध्यमाम्॥<br />As I have found her alone in the hermitage, I am determined to carry her away by force. My heart burns with rage when I think that Bhrigu has obtained this beautiful woman who was betrothed to me.</p>

<p id='27'>सौतिरुवाच तस्यैतद्वचनं श्रुत्वा सप्ताचिर्दुःखितोऽभवत्। भीतोऽनृताच्च शापाच्च भृगोरित्यब्रवीच्छनैः॥<br />Sauti said: Having heard his words, the seven flamed Deity felt himself very much in difficulty. He was afraid to tell an untruth and was equally afraid of Bhrigu's curse. He at last slowly said.</p>
<p id='28'>अग्निरुवाच त्वया वृता पुलोमेयं पूर्वं दानवनन्दन। किं त्वियं विधिना पूर्वं मन्त्रवन वृता त्वया॥<br />Agni said : "O Rakshasa, it is true that this Puloma was first betrothed to you, but she was not taken by you with (the necessary) holy rites and invocations.</p>
