<h3>SAMBHAVA PARVA: Chapter 79</h3><h4>History of Yayati</h4><p id='1'>शुक्र उवाच यः परेषां नरो नित्यमतिवादांस्तितिक्षते। देवयानि विजानीहि तेन सर्वमिदं जितम्॥ उच्यते॥ यः समुत्पतितं क्रोधं निगृह्णाति हयं यथा। स यन्तेत्युच्यते सद्भिर्न यो रश्मिषु लम्बते॥२१.<br />Shukra said: O Devayani, know that the man who does not regard the evil words of others, conquers every thing. The wise men call him a true charioteer who holds tightly the reins of his horses. He is a true man who subdues his rising anger.</p>
<p id='2'>यः समुत्पतितं क्रोधमक्रोधेन निरस्यति। देवयानि विजानीहि तेन सर्वमिदं जितम्॥<br />O Devayani, know that he who subdues the rising anger by his feeling of non-anger, conquers everything on earth.</p>
<p id='3'>यः समुत्पतितं क्रोधं क्षमयेह निरस्यति। यथोरगस्त्वचं जीर्णा स वै पुरुष<br />He who subdues his rising anger by forgiveness like the casting off the slough of a snake is called a true man.</p>
<p id='4'>यः संधारयते मन्यु योऽतिवादांस्तितिक्षते। यश्च तप्तो न तपति दृढं सोऽर्थस्य भाजनम्॥<br />He who subdues his anger, he who does not regard the bad words of others, he who is not angry even when there is a cause, certainly acquires the four objects for which we live (namely Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha.)</p>
<p id='5'>यो यजेदपरिश्रान्तो मासि मासि शतं समाः। न क्रुद्धेयद् यश्च सर्वस्य तयोरक्रोधनोऽधिकः॥<br />Between the two men, one performing sacrifices continually every month for one hundred years and one who does not feel any anger, the man who does not feel any anger is the greater man.</p>
<p id='6'>यत् कुमाराः कुमार्यश्च वैरं कुर्युरचेतसः। न तत् प्राज्ञोऽनुकुर्वीत न विदुस्ते बलाबलम्॥<br />Boys and girls, who are incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, quarrel among one another. The wise never imitate them.</p>
<p id='7'>देवयान्युवाच वेदाहं तात बालापि धर्माणां यदिहान्तरम्। अक्रोधे चातिवादे च वेद चापि बलाबलम्॥<br />the power Devayani said: O father, I know, though I am a girl, what are duties and virtues. I also know the difference between anger and forgiveness and of each.</p>
<p id='8'>शिष्यस्याशिष्यवृत्तेस्तु न क्षन्तव्यं बुभूषता। तस्मात् संकीर्णवृत्तेषु वासो मम न रोचते॥<br />But when a pupil behaves disrespectfully towards his tutor, he should never be forgiven by the preceptor, if he wants to benefit him. Therefore, I do not desire to live in a country where the people are so bad.</p>
<p id='9'>पुमांसो ये हि निन्दन्ति वृत्तेनाभिजनेन च। न तेषु निवसेत् प्राज्ञः श्रेयोऽर्थी पापबुद्धिषु॥<br />The wise man who desire the good of all, should not live among men who are sinfully inclined and she always speak ill of men of high birth and good behaviour.</p>
<p id='10'>ये त्वेनपभिजानन्ति वृत्तेनाभिजनेन वा। तेषु साधुषु वस्तव्यं स वासः श्रेष्ठ उच्यते॥<br />It is said to be the best place to live where high birth and good conduct are known and respected and where men know our birth and behaviour.</p>
<p id='11'>वाग् दुरुक्तं महाघोरं दुहितुर्वृषपर्वणः। मम मनाति हृदयमग्निकाम इवारणिम्॥<br />The cruel words of the daughter of Vrishaparva burn my heart, as men, desirous of kindling a fire, burn the dry woods.</p>
<p id='12'>यः सपत्नश्रियं दीप्तां हीनश्रीः पर्युपासते। मरणं शोभनं तस्य इति विद्वज्जना विदुः॥<br />I think nothing is more painful in the three worlds than to adore one's enemies, who are blessed with good fortune, whereas he possesses none. The learned men have said that death would be preferable to such a man.</p>
