<p id='2'>नायं युक्तः समाचार: पाण्डवेषु महात्मसु। यत् कामात् पुण्डरीकाक्षं पाण्डवार्चितवानसि॥<br />Your this conduct in willfully making this lotus-eyed hero worshipped by the Pandavas is not worthy of the illustrious Pandavas.</p>
<p id='3'>बाला यूयं न जानीध्वं धर्मः सूक्ष्मो हि पाण्डवाः। अयं च स्मृत्यतिक्रान्तो ह्यापगेयोऽल्पदर्शनः॥<br />O sons of Pandu, you are children; you do now know what Dharma is, for it (the ways of Dharma) is very subtle. This son of the river (Bhishma) has but little knowledge, and therefore he has transgressed the Smriti (rules of morality).</p>
<p id='4'>त्वादृशो धर्मयुक्तो हि कुर्वाणः प्रियकाम्यया। भवत्यभ्यधिकं भीष्म लोकेष्ववमत: सताम्॥<br />O Bhishma, if a man like you, possessing virtue and morality, acts from motives of pleasing others, he (surely) becomes worthy of censure among all the honest and wise men.</p>
<p id='5'>कथं डराजा दाशार्हो मध्ये सर्वमहीक्षिताम्। अर्हणामर्हति तथा यथा युष्माभिरर्चितः॥<br />How does this man of the Dasarha race, who is not a king, deserve to be worshipped among these kings that you have worshipped him?</p>

<p id='14'>नृपे च रुक्मिणि श्रेष्ठे एकलव्ये तथैव च। शल्ये मद्राधिपे चैव कथं कृष्णस्त्वयार्चितः॥<br />That best of kings, Rukmi, and Ekalavya, and the king of the Madras, Shalya, are present, why Krishna has been worshipped?</p>
<p id='15'>अयं च सर्वराज्ञां वै बलश्लाघी महाबलः। जामदग्न्यस्य दयितः शिष्यो विप्रस्य भारत॥ येनात्मबलमाश्रित्य राजानो युधि निर्जिताः। तं च कर्णमतिक्रम्य कथं कृष्णस्त्वयार्चितः॥<br />O descendant of Bharata, this greatly powerful hero whose prowess is the pride amongst all kings, who is the favourite disciple of the son of the Brahmana Jamadagni, the hero who defeated all the kings by his prowess alone, that Karna being present here, passing over him, why Krishna has been worshipped?</p>
