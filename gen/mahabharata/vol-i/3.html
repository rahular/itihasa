His brothers were three, namely-Shrutasena, Ugrasena and Bhimasena. When they were sitting at the sacrifice, there came the son of Sarama.</p>
<p id='2'>जनमेजयस्य भ्रातृभिरभिहतो भ्रातृभिरभिहतो रोरूयमाणो मातुः समीपमुपागच्छत्॥<br />He, being beaten by the brothers of Janamejaya, went to his mother weeping.</p>
<p id='3'>पुत्रदुःखार्ता तं माता रोरूयमाणमुवाच 'किं रोदिषि, केनास्यभिहत' इति॥<br />His mother, seeing him weep, asked him, “Why are you weeping, who has beaten you?"</p>
<p id='4'>प्रत्युवाच-'जनमेजयस्य भ्रातृभिरभिहतोऽस्मि' इति॥<br />Being thus questioned, he replied to his mother, “I have been beaten by the brothers of Janamejaya."</p>
<p id='5'>तं माता प्रत्युवाच-'व्यक्तं त्वया तत्रापराद्धम्, येनास्यभिहतः' इति॥<br />And then his mother said, "You must have committed some fault, for which you have been beaten.'</p>
<p id='6'>स तां पुनरुवाच 'नापराध्यामि, किंचिन्नावेक्षे, हवींषि नावलिह' इति॥<br />He replied, “I committed no fault. I did not lick the sacrificial ghee, I did not cast even a look at it."</p>
<p id='7'>तच्छ्रुत्वा माता सरमा तत्सत्रमुपागच्छत्, यत्र स जनमेजयः सह भ्रातृभिर्दीर्घसत्रमुपास्ते॥<br />Hearing this her mother, being very sorry for the affliction of his son, went to the place where Janamejaya with his brothers were attending his long sacrifice.</p>
<p id='8'>तया क्रुद्धया तत्रोक्त 'अयं मे पुत्रो न किंचिदपराध्यति, नावेक्षते, हवींषि, नावलेढि, किमर्थमभिहतः' इति॥<br />She angrily addressed Janamejaya thus, “My son did not commit any fault. He did not lick your sacrificial ghee, he did not even look at it. Why did you then beat him?”</p>
<p id='9'>न किंचिदुक्तवन्तस्ते सा तानुवाच 'यस्मादयमभिहतो ऽनपकारी, तस्माददृष्टं त्वां भयमागमिष्यति' इति।॥<br />They did not (condescend) to reply to her. On this she said, “ As you beat my son who did not commit any fault, so will evil come to you when you least expect it."</p>
<p id='10'>जनमेजय एवमुक्तो देवशुन्या सरमया भृशं संभ्रान्तो विषण्णश्चासीत्॥ स<br />Janamejaya, having been thus cursed by the celestial bitch, Sarama, was very much alarmed and dejected.</p>
<p id='11'>तस्मिन्सत्रे समाप्ते हास्तिनपुरं प्रत्येत्य पुरोहितमनुरूपमन्विष्यमाणः परं यत्नमकरोद्यो मे पापकृत्यां शमयेदिति॥<br />After finishing the sacrifice, he returned to Hastinapur and took great pains to find out a priest who could neutralise the effect of the curse by procuring absolution from his sin.</p>
<p id='12'>स कदाचिन्मृगयां गतः पारिक्षितो जनमेजयः कस्मिंश्चित्स्वविषय आश्रममपश्यत्॥<br />Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit, when out in hunting, saw in one part of his dominion a holy hermitage.</p>
<p id='13'>तत्र कश्चिद्ऋषिरासाञ्चक्रे श्रुतश्रवा नाम। तपस्यभिरतः पुत्र आस्ते सोमश्रवा नाम॥<br />Where lived a Rishi, named Srutashrava; he had a son who was named Somashrava, who was deeply engaged in austere penances.</p>
<p id='14'>तस्य तं पुत्रमभिगम्य जनमेजयः पारिक्षितः पौरोहित्याय ववे॥<br />Being desirous to make the son of the Rishi his priest, Janamejaya,</p>
<p id='15'>स नमस्कृत्य तमृषिमुवाच-'भगवन्यं तव पुत्रो मम पुरोहितोऽस्तु' इति॥<br />Saluted him and said, "O Bhagvan, allow your son to be my priest."</p>
<p id='16'>स एवमुक्तः प्रत्युवाच जनमेजयम् 'भो जनमेजय, पुत्रोऽयं मम सर्म्या जातो महातपस्वी स्वाध्यायसंपन्नो मत्तपोवीर्यसंभृतो मच्छुक्रं पीतवत्यास्तस्याः कुक्षौ जातः॥<br />Being thus addressed by Janamejaya, the Rishi replied, “O Janamejaya, my son is accomplished in the study of the Vedas, endued with my full asceticism and deep in devotion, but he is born in the womb of a serpent who swallowed my vital fluid.</p>
<p id='17'>समर्थोऽयं भवतः सर्वाः पापकृत्याः शमयितुमन्तरेण महादेवकृत्याम्॥<br />"He is able to absolve you from all sins except those committed against Mahadeva.</p>

He then addressed his brothers thus, I have chosen this person as my priest. Whatever he will command to do must be obeyed by you without questioning.” The brothers did as they were requested. Giving these instructions to his brothers he marched against Takshashila and conquered that country.</p>
<p id='21'>एतस्मिन्नन्तरे कश्चिद् ऋषिौम्यो नामायोदः। तस्य शिष्यास्त्रयो बभूवुः॥ उपमन्युरारुणिर्वेदश्चेति स एकं शिष्यमारुणिं पाञ्चाल्यं प्रेषयामास 'गच्छ, केदारखण्डं बधान' इति॥<br />About this time there was also a Rishi, named Ayoda-Dhaumya. He had three disciples namely Upamanyu, Aruni and Veda. One day the Rishi asked one of these three disciples, Aruni of Panchala, to go and stop a breach in the water-course in his field.</p>
<p id='22'>स उपाध्यायेन संदिष्ट आरुणिः पाञ्चाल्यस्तत्र गत्वा तम्, केदारखण्डं बर्द्ध नाशकत्। क्लिश्यमानोऽपश्यदुपायम् भवत्वेवं करिष्यामि॥ स तत्र संविवेश केदारखण्डे। शयाने च तथा तस्मिंस्तदुदकं तस्थौ॥<br />Thus ordered by the preceptor, Aruni of Panchala went to the spot, but could not stop the breach. He was very sorry that he could not carry out his preceptor's bidding, but at last he saw a means and he said, “I shall do it in this way." He entered into the breach and there laid himself down and thus the water was stopped.</p>
<p id='23'>ततः कदाचिदुपाध्याय आपोदो धौम्यः शिष्यानपृच्छत् 'क्व आरुणिः पाञ्चाल्यो गतः' इति॥<br />Sometime after, the preceptor AyudaDhaumya enquired of his other disciples where Aruni of Panchala went.</p>
<p id='24'>ते तं प्रत्यूचुः ‘भगवंस्त्वयैव प्रेषितः' गच्छ केदारखण्डं बधान इति। स एवमुक्तस्तान् शिष्यान् प्रत्युवाच'तस्मात्तत्र सर्वे गच्छामो यत्र स गतः' इति।॥<br />Having been thus addressed, they replied, “Sir, he has been sent by you to stop the breach of the water-course in the field.” Dhaumya, thus reminded, said to his pupils, “Let us all go to the place where he is."</p>
<p id='25'>स तत्र गत्वा तस्याहानाय शब्दं चकार-'भो आरुणे, पाञ्चाल्य, क्वासि वत्स, एहि, इति॥<br />Having gone there, he cried, “O Aruni of Panchala, where are you? Come here, my child."</p>

Having been unable to stop it by and other means, I entered myself into the breach to prevent the water from running out. It is only when I heard your honour's voice that I have left it and allowed the waters to escape. I salute you, great teacher, tell me what I am to do now.</p>
<p id='28'>स एवमुक्त उपाध्यायः प्रत्युवाच 'यस्माद्भवान् केदारखण्डं विदार्योत्थितः, तस्मादुद्दालक एव नाम्ना भवान् भविष्यति इत्युपाध्यायेनानुगृहीतः॥<br />The preceptor, thus addressed, said, "As you have opened the water-course in getting from the ditch, you shall be henceforth known as Uddalaka as a mark of your action" and blessed him.</p>
<p id='29'>'यस्माच्च त्वया मद्वचनमनुष्ठितम्, तस्माच्छ्रेयो ऽवाप्स्यसि। सर्वे च ते वेदाः प्रतिभास्यन्ति, सर्वाणि च धर्मशास्त्राणि' इति॥<br />And as you have obeyed my command, you shall obtain good fortune. All the Vedas will shine in you and so will all the Dharma Shastras."</p>
<p id='30'>स एवमुक्त उपाध्यायेनेष्टं देशं जगाम। अथापर: शिष्योऽस्यैवापोदस्य धौम्यस्योपमन्युर्नाम॥<br />Being thus blessed by his preceptor, Aruni went away to the country where his heart longed to go. The name of another AyudaDhaumya's disciples was Upamanyu.</p>
<p id='31'>तं चोपाध्यायः प्रेषयामास-'वत्सोपमन्यो! गा रक्षस्व' इति॥<br />Him the preceptor thus addressed, “Go my child, look after my kine.</p>

You diminish the support of others who live by begging. Having thus supported yourself you have showed that you are coveteous.</p>

You do not also go out begging for the second time. How do you now manage to support yourself?”</p>

You should not stand in the way of their full meal. Know, it is not proper for you to drink the froth.” Upamanyu assented to this and went to tend the cattle.</p>

One day being very much oppressed by hunger he ate the leaves of Arka tree in a forest. His eyes were affected by the pungent, acrimonious, crude and saline qualities of the leaves and he became blind. When he was thus walking about feeling his way he fell into a deep well.</p>

He is therefore, making late to come home. Let us go and find him out." Having said this, he went with his pupils into the forest and called aloud. “Ho, Upamanyu, where are you? My child, come here."</p>
