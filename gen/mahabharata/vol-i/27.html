<h3>ASTIKA PARVA.: Chapter 27</h3><h4>Story of Garuda</h4><p id='1'>सौतिरुवाच संप्रहृष्टात्स्ततो नागा जलधाराप्लुतास्तदा। सुपर्णेनोह्यमानास्ते जग्मुस्तं द्वीपमाशु वै॥<br />Sauti said: The Nagas became exceedingly glad on being wetted by the great shower; and carried by the bird (Garuda) they soon arrived at the island.</p>
<p id='2'>तं द्वीपं मकरावासं विहितं विश्वकर्मणा। तत्र ते लवणं घोरं ददृशुः पूर्वमागताः॥<br />That island was assigned by the creator as the abode of Makaras. Coming there they first saw the fearful Lavana.</p>
<p id='3'>सुपर्णसहिताः सर्पाः काननं च मनोरमम्। सागराम्बुपरिक्षिप्तं पक्षिसंघनिनादितम्॥<br />They with Garuda saw the charming woods, washed by the waters of the sea and resounding with the music of the birds.</p>
<p id='4'>विचित्रफलपुष्पाभिर्वनराजिभिरावृतम्। भवनैरावृतं रम्यैस्तथा पद्माकरैरपि॥<br />There were beautiful trees full of various fruits and flowers, there were also charming mansions and many tanks with lotuses.</p>
<p id='5'>प्रसन्नसलिलैश्चापि ह्रदैर्दिव्यैर्विभूषितम्। दिव्यगन्धवहैः पुण्यैर्मारुतैरुपवीजितम्॥<br />It was adorned with many beautiful lakes of pure water; it was refreshed with sweet incense-carrying breezes.</p>
<p id='6'>उत्पतद्भिरिवाकाशं वृक्षैर्मलयजैरपि। शोभितं पुष्पवर्षाणि मुञ्चद्भिर्मारुतोद्धतैः॥<br />It was adorned with many trees that only grow on the Malaya hill, as high as the high heavens. It, being shaken by the breeze, dropped showers of flowers.</p>
<p id='7'>वायुविक्षिप्तकुसुमैस्तथाऽन्यैरपि पादपैः। किरद्भिरिव तत्रस्थानागान्पुष्पाम्बुवृष्टिभिः॥<br />There were also various other trees whose flowers were scattered about by the breeze. It seemed as if these trees bathed the Nagas with a shower of rain in the shape of their flowers.</p>
<p id='8'>मन:संहर्षजं दिव्यं गन्धर्वाप्सरसां प्रियम्। मत्तभ्रमरसंघुष्टं मनोज्ञाकृतिदर्शनम्॥<br />It was charming, beautiful and dear to the Gandharvas and always gave them pleasure. It was full of bees intoxicated with the honey they sucked. The sight of its appearance was exceedingly beautiful.</p>
<p id='9'>रमणीयं शिवं पुण्यं सर्वैर्जनमनोहरैः। नानापक्षिरुतं रम्यं कदूपुत्रप्रहर्षणम्॥<br />It was beautiful, beneficial, holy and charming to all. Echoing with the sweet notes of various birds, it much delighted the sons of Kadru.</p>
<p id='10'>तत्ते वनं समासाद्य विजह्वः पन्नगास्तदा। अब्रुवंश्च महावीर्यं सुपर्णं पतगेश्वरम्॥<br />Having arrived at that forest, the snakes very much enjoyed themselves and then they commanded the king of the birds, Garuda of great strength.</p>
<p id='11'>वहास्मानपरं द्वीपं सुरम्यं विमलोदकम्। त्वं हि देशान्बहूनम्यान्व्रजन्पश्यसि खेचर॥<br />“Take us to some other beautiful islands with pure water. O bird, you must have seen many beautiful countries when coursing through the sky."</p>
<p id='12'>स विचिन्त्याब्रवीत्पक्षी मातरं विनतां तदा। किं कारणं मया मातः कर्तव्यं सर्पभाषितम्॥<br />Having reflected for some time he (Garuda) asked his mother. “Why, O mother, am I to do the bidding of these snakes?"</p>
<p id='13'>विनतोवाच दासीभूतास्मि दुर्योगात्सपल्याः पतगोत्तम। पणं वितथमास्थाय सस्पधिना कृतम्॥<br />Vinata said: O best of birds, from misfortune, I have become a slave of my husband's second wife. The snakes caused me to lose the wager by deception; and thus have I become a slave.</p>
<p id='14'>तस्मिंस्तु कथिते मात्रा कारणे गगनेचरः। उवाच वचनं सस्तेिन दुःखेन दुःखितः॥<br />When his mother told him the reason, the bird in great sorrow said to the snakes.</p>
<p id='15'>किमाहत्य विदित्वा वा किं वा कृत्वेह पौरुषम्। दास्याद्वो विप्रमुच्येयं तथ्यं वदत लेलिहाः॥<br />“Tell me, O snakes, by bringing what, or gaining what knowledge or doing what great work, we may be freed from this state of slavery.</p>
<p id='16'>सौतिरुवाच श्रुत्वा तमब्रुवन्सर्पा आहरामृतमोजसा। ततो दास्याद्विप्रमोक्षो भविता तव खेचर॥<br />Sauti said: Having heard him the snakes said, “Bring the Ambrosia by force. Then, O bird, you will be freed from slavery."</p>
