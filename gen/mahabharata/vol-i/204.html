<p id='22'>किमन्यद् विहिता नूनं तस्य सा पुरुषेन्द्रता। यदि ते विहितं राज्यं भविष्यति विशाम्पते॥ मिषतः सर्वलोकस्य स्थास्यते त्वयि तद् ध्रुवम्। अतोऽन्यथा चेद् विहितं यतमानो न लप्स्यसे॥<br />O king, what else human exertion can be said to have been in him than that the kingdom was dependent on his Destiny. If this kingdom be fixed in you by destiny. It will certainly remain in you, notwithstanding the enmity of all the worlds. If otherwise, however you may try, it will never remain in you.</p>
