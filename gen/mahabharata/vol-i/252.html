<h3>RAJASUYARAMBHA PARVA: Chapter 18</h3><h4>The birth of Jarasandha</h4><p id='1'>राक्षस्युवाच जरा नामास्मि भद्रं ते राक्षसी कामरूपिणी। तव वेश्मनि राजेन्द्र पूजिता न्यवसं सुखम्॥<br />The Rakshasi said O king of kings, be blessed, I am a Rakshasas woman, called Jara. I am capable of going everywhere at will. Worshipped by all, I live in your house in joy.</p>

<p id='3'>दानवानां विनाशाय स्थापिता दिव्यरूपिणी। यो मां भक्त्या लिखेत् कुड्ये सपुत्रां यौवनान्विताम्॥३। गृहे तस्य भवेद् वृद्धिरन्यथा क्षयमाप्नुयात्। त्वद्गृहे तिष्ठमानाहं पूजिताहं सदा विभो॥ लिखिता चैव कुड्येषु पुत्रैर्बहुभिरावृता। गन्धपुष्पैस्तथा धूपैर्भक्ष्यभोज्यैः सुपूजिता॥<br />I was endued with celestials beauty and I was placed (in the world) for the destruction of the Danavas. He, who with devotion paints on the walls (of his house) and likeness of myself who am young and who have children, must have prosperity in his house. He, who does not do it, must meet with decay and destruction. O lord, a likeness of myself surrounded by many children, is painted on the walls of your house. Placed their, I am daily worshipped with scents, flowers, incense, edibles and various objects of enjoyments.</p>

<p id='6'>मेरुं वा खादितुं शक्ता किं पुनस्त्व बालकम्। गृहसम्पूजनात् तुष्ट्या मया प्रत्यर्पितस्तव॥<br />I can swallow (even) the mountain of Meru, what I speak of your child. I am gratified with the worship that I receive in your house; therefore the child is returned to you,</p>
<p id='7'>श्रीकृष्ण उवाच एवमुक्त्वा तु सा राजंस्तत्रैवान्तरधीयत। स संगृह्य कुमारं तं प्रविवेश गृहं नृपः॥<br />Krishna said O king having said this, she disappeared there and then. Obtaining the child the king then entered his own house.</p>
<p id='8'>तस्य बालस्य यत् कृत्यं तच्चकार नृपस्तदा। आज्ञापयच्च राक्षस्या मगधेषु महोत्सवम्॥<br />The 'king then caused all the rites and ceremonies of infancy to be performed on the child; he ordered a festival to be observed in Magadha (by his subjects) in honour of the Rakshasas woman.</p>

<p id='10'>सोऽवर्धत महातेजा मगधाधिपतेः सुतः। प्रमाणबलसम्पन्नो हुताहुतिरिवानलः। मातापित्रोर्नन्दिकरः शुक्लपक्षे यथा शशी॥<br />The greatly powerful son of the Magadha king begin to grow up in bulk and in strength, like a fire into which libations of Ghee have been poured. He delighted the heart of his father and mother, increasing day by day like the moon in the white-fortnight.</p>
