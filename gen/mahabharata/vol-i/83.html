<p id='12'>ददर्श च तदा तत्र कुमारान् देवरूपिणः। कुमारान् पर्यपृच्छता क्रीडमानान् सुविश्रब्धान् विस्मिता चेदमब्रवीत्॥<br />There she saw three children of celestial beauty, playing with perfect ease. She was surprised and thus spoke to the king.</p>
<p id='13'>देवयान्युवाच कस्यैते दारका राजन् देवपुत्रोपमाः शुभाः। वर्चसा रूपतश्चैव सदृशा मे मतास्तव॥<br />Devayani said : O king, whose children are these, so handsome, so like the children of the celestial? They are exactly like you in splendour and beauty.</p>
<p id='14'>वैशम्पायन उवाच एवं पृष्ट्वा तु राजानं<br />Vaishampayana said : Having asked the king, she asked the children.</p>

<p id='22'>यदा त्वया वृतो भर्ता वृत एव तदा मया। सखीभर्ता हि धर्मेण भर्ता भवति शोभने॥ पूज्यासि मम मान्या च ज्येष्ठा च ब्राह्मणी ह्यसि। त्वत्तोऽपि मे पूज्यतमो राजर्षिः किं न वेत्थ तत्॥<br />Therefore, I am not afraid of you. When you chose the king as your husband, I too did the same. O beautiful lady, a friend's husband is one's own husband according to the precept of religion. You are a daughter of a Brahmana and therefore you deserve my greatest worship and regard. Do you no know that this royal sage (Yayati) is the object of greater esteem to me?</p>

<p id='32'>ययातिरुवाच ऋतुं वै याचमानाया भगवन् नान्यचेतसा। दुहितुर्दानवेन्द्रस्य धर्म्यमेतत् कृतं मया॥ ऋतुं वै याचमानाया न ददाति पुमानृतुम्। भ्रूणहेत्युच्यते ब्रह्मन् स इह ब्रह्मवादिभिः॥ अभिकामां स्त्रियं यश्च गम्यां रहसि याचितः। नोपैति स च धर्मेषु भ्रूणहेत्युच्यते बुधैः॥<br />Yayati said: Adorable Rishi, I was solicited by the daughter of the Danava king to make her season fruitful. I did grant her prayer from a sense of virtue. O Rishi, men learned in the Vedas say that he, who does not grant the prayer of a woman in season, commits the sin of killing an embryo. He, who, being solicited in secret by a woman full of desire and in season, does not grant her wishes, loses virtue. The learned say that he becomes a killer of embryo.</p>

<p id='36'>ययातिरुवाच अतृप्तो यौवनस्याहं देवयान्यां भृगूद्वह। प्रसादं कुरु मे ब्रह्मञ्जरेयं न विशेच माम्॥<br />Yayati said : O son of Bhrigu, I have not been as yet satiated with youth of Devayani. Therefore, O Brahmana, be graceful to Let not decrepitude overcome me. me.</p>
