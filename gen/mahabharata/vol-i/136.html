<p id='36'>वैशम्पायन उवाच ततस्तस्मिन् क्षणे कर्णः सलाजकुसुमैर्घटैः। काञ्चनैः काञ्चने पीद्दे मन्त्रविद्भिर्महारथः॥ अभिषिक्तोऽङ्गराज्ये स श्रिया युक्तो महाबलः। सच्छत्रवालव्यजनो जयशब्दोत्तरेण च॥<br />Vaishampayana said : When the cheers cease at that very moment the greatly powerful car-warrior Karna, seated on a golden seat, the (royal) umbrella over his head and yak tails waved by his side, was installed king of Anga by the Brahmanas, learned in the Mantras, in the proper form, with paddy, flowers, Ghata (water pots) and much fold.</p>
<p id='37'>उवाच कौरवं राजन् वचनं स वृषस्तदा। अस्य राज्यप्रदानस्य सदृशं किं ददानि ते॥ प्रब्रूहि राजशार्दूल कर्ता ह्यस्मि तथा नृप। अत्यन्तं सख्यमिच्छामीत्याह तं स सुयोधनः॥<br />O king, (Karna) said to the Kauravas (Duryodhana), "What shall I give you compared," your gift of a kingdom! O king O best of men, I shall do all you will command." Suyodhana (Duryodhana) replied, “I long for your friendship."</p>
<p id='38'>एवमुक्तस्ततः कर्णस्तथेति प्रत्युवाच तम्। हर्षाच्चोभौ समाश्लिष्य परां मुदमवापतुः॥<br />Having been thus addressed, Karna replied. “Be it so." They thereupon embraced each other in joy and felt great happiness.</p>
