<h3>SAMBHAVA PARVA: Chapter 132</h3><h4>Drona's examination his pupils</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच ततः सम्पूजितो द्रोणो भीष्मेण द्विपदां वरः। विशश्राम महातेजाः पूजित: कुरुवेश्मनि॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Thereupon that best of men, that greatly effulgent Drona, worshipped by Bhishma, took up his quarters in the house of the Kurus and was adored by them all.</p>
<p id='2'>विश्रान्तेऽथ गुरौ तस्मिन् पौत्रानादाय कौरवान्। शिष्यत्वेन ददौ भीष्मो वसूनि विविधानि च॥ गृहं च सुपरिच्छन्नं धनधान्यसमाकुलम्। भारद्वाजाय सुप्रीतः प्रत्यपादयत प्रभुः॥<br />When he had taken rest for a while, Bhishma, taking his grandsons, the Kurus, gave them to him as his pupils, making him their preceptor with the presents of various wealth. That lord (Bhishma) gave the son of Bharadvaja (Drona) a neat and tidy house, well filled with paddy and every kind of wealth.</p>
<p id='3'>सताशिष्यान् महेष्वासः प्रतिजग्राह कौरवान्। पाण्डवान् धार्तराष्ट्रांश्च द्रोणो मुदितमानसः॥<br />That great bowman, Drona, in delightful heart, accepted the Kurus, the sons of Dhritarashtra and Pandu, as his pupils.</p>
<p id='4'>प्रतिगृह्य च तान् सर्वान् द्रोणो वचनमब्रवीत्। रहस्येकः प्रतीतात्मा कृतोपसदनांस्तथा।॥<br />Having accepted them all as (his pupils), Drona called them apart and spoke, to them confidently thus-</p>
<p id='5'>द्रोण उवाच कार्यं मे काक्षितं किंचिद्धदि सम्परिवर्तते। कृतास्त्रैस्तत् प्रदेयं मे तदेतद् वदतानघाः॥<br />Drona said: "O sinless ones, I have a particular desire in my heart; promise me truly that you will accomplish it when you will become skilled in arms.</p>
<p id='6'>वैशम्पायन उवाच तच्छ्रुत्वा कौरवेयास्ते तूष्णीमासन् विशाम्पते। अर्जुनस्तु ततः सर्वं प्रतिजज्ञे परंतप॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Hearing these words, the Kuru princes remained silent. O chastiser of foes, Arjuna, (however), vowed to accomplish it.</p>
<p id='7'>ततोऽर्जुनं तदा मूर्ध्नि समाघ्राय पुनः पुनः। प्रीतिपूर्वं परिष्वज्य प्ररुरोद मुदा तदा॥<br />Drona then cheerfully clasped Arjuna to his bosom and repeatedly took the scent of his head and shed tears of joy.</p>
<p id='8'>ततो द्रोणः पाण्डुपुत्रानस्त्राणि विविधानि च। ग्राहयामास दिव्यानि मानुषाणि च वीर्यवान्॥<br />The greatly powerful Drona taught the sons of Pandu (the use of) various weapons, both celestial and human.</p>
<p id='9'>राजपुत्रास्तथा चान्ये समेत्य भरतर्षभ। अभिजग्मुस्ततो द्रोणमस्त्रार्थे द्विजसत्तमम्॥<br />O best of Bharata race, many other princes also flocked to that best of Brahmanas, Drona, to learn (the science of) arms.</p>
<p id='10'>वृष्णयश्चान्धकाश्चैव नानादेश्याश्च पार्थिवाः। सूतपुत्रश्च राधेयो गुरुं द्रोणमियात् तदा॥<br />The Vrishnis, the Andhakas and the princes from various countries and the son of Suta and Radha (Karna) made Drona their preceptor.</p>
<p id='11'>स्पर्धमानस्तु पार्थेन सूतपुत्रोऽत्यमर्षणः। दुर्योधनं समाश्रित्य सोऽवमन्यत पाण्डवान्॥<br />The son of Suta (Karna), being jealous of Partha (Arjuna), always defied him and being supported by Duryodhana disregarded the Pandavas.</p>
<p id='12'>अभ्ययात् स ततो द्रोणं धनुर्वेदचिकीर्षया। शिक्षाभुजबलोद्योगैस्तेषु सर्वेषु पाण्डवः। अस्त्रविद्यानुरागाच्च विशिष्टोऽभवदर्जुनः॥ तुल्येष्वस्त्रप्रयोगेषु लाघवे सौष्ठवेषु च। सर्वेषामेव शिष्याणां बभूवाभ्यधिकोऽर्जुनः॥<br />That Pandava (Arjuna) from his eager desire to learn the science of arms always remained at the side of Drona and he excelled all in skill, in strength of arms and in perseverance, on account of his love for the science of arms.</p>
<p id='13'>ऐन्द्रिमप्रतिमं द्रोण उपदेशेष्वमन्यता एवं सर्वकुमाराणामिष्वस्त्रं प्रत्यपादयत्॥<br />Though he (Drona) gave equal instructions to all, yet Arjuna became the foremost of all in lightness and skill. Drona was convinced that none of his pupils would be able to equal that son of Indra.</p>
<p id='14'>कमण्डलुं च सर्वेषां प्रायच्छच्चिरकारणात्। पुत्राय च ददौ कुम्भमविलम्बनकारणात्॥ यावत् ते नोपगच्छन्ति तावदस्मै परां क्रियाम्। द्रोण आचष्ट पुत्राय तत् कर्म जिष्णुरौहत॥<br />Thus he gave instructions to all the princes in the (science of) arms. To keep them away for long, he gave them Kamandala (a vessel narrow mouth) for fetching water. But he gave his son a Kumbha (wide mounted vessel to fetch water), so that it may not take him, long (to fill it). When they were thus kept away, Drona instructed his son some superior methods of using arms. Arjuna came to know it.</p>
<p id='15'>ततः स वारुणास्त्रेण पूरयित्वा कमण्डलुम्। सममाचार्यपुत्रेण गुरुमभ्येति फाल्गुनः॥ आचार्यपुत्रात् तस्मात् तु विशेषोपचयेऽपृथका न व्यहीयत मेधावी पार्थोऽप्यस्त्रविदां वरः॥ अर्जुनः परमं यत्नमातिष्ठद् गुरुपूजने। अस्त्रे च परमं योगं प्रियो द्रोणस्य चाभवत्॥<br />Thereupon he filled his Kamandala with the Varuna weapon and came to his preceptor at the same time with his preceptor's son and thus the intelligent son of Pritha, that foremost of all the learned in arms, became in no way inferior to his preceptor's son. Arjuna took great deal of care in worshipping the preceptor; he had great devotion of his study of the science of arms, therefore, he became a great favourite of Drona.</p>
<p id='16'>तं दृष्ट्वा नित्यमुद्युक्तमिष्वस्त्रं प्रति फाल्गुनम्। आहूय वचनं द्रोणो रहः सूदमभाषत॥ अन्धकारेऽर्जुनायान्नं न देयं ते कदाचन। न चाख्येयमिदं चापि मद्वाक्यं विजये त्वया॥<br />Drona, seeing Falguni's (Arjuna) great devotion of arms, summoned the cook and told him in private, “Never give rice (food) to Arjuna in the dark and never told him also that I have asked you to do it."</p>
<p id='17'>ततः कदाचिद् भुञ्जाने प्रववौ वायुरर्जुने। तेन तत्र प्रदीपः स दीप्यमानो विलोपितः॥<br />On a certain day when Arjuna was taking his food, a wind arose and the burning lamp went out.</p>
<p id='18'>भुक्त एव तु कौन्तेयो नास्यादन्यत्र वर्तते। हस्तस्तेजस्विनस्तस्य अनुग्रहणकारणात्॥<br />The effulgent son of Kunti, (Arjuna) continued eating the dark, his hand from habit going to his mouth.</p>
<p id='19'>तदभ्यासकृतं मत्वा रात्रावपि स पाण्डवः। योग्यां चक्रे महाबाहुर्धनुषा पाण्डुनन्दनः॥<br />Thinking this to be the result of the force of habit, the mighty armed son of Pandu practiced with his bow in the night.</p>
<p id='20'>तस्य ज्यातलनिर्घोषं द्रोणः शुश्राव भारत। उपेत्य चैनमुत्थाय परिष्वज्येदमब्रवीत्॥<br />O descendant of the Bharata race, bearing the twang of his bow string, in the night, Drona came to him and embracing him spoke to him thus-</p>
<p id='21'>द्रोण उवाच प्रयतिष्ये तथा कर्तुं यथा नान्यो धनुर्धरः। त्वत्समो भविता लोके सत्यमेतद् ब्रवीमि ते॥<br />Drona said: I speak to you truly that I shall do to you that by which there will be no bowman in the world who will be equal to you.</p>
<p id='22'>वैशम्पायन उवाच ततो द्रोणोऽर्जुनं भूयो हयेषु च गजेषु च। रथेषु भूमावपि च रणशिक्षामशिक्षयत्॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Thereupon Drona taught Arjuna the art of fighting on horse back and on the back of the elephants, on car and on the ground.</p>
<p id='23'>गदायुद्धेऽसिचर्यायां तोमरप्रासशक्तिषु। द्रोणः संकीर्णयुद्धे च शिक्षयामास कौरवान्॥<br />Drona taught that Kaurava (Arjuna) how to fight with clubs, the sword, the lance, the spear and the dart. He taught him the use of many other weapons and how to fight with many men.</p>
<p id='24'>तस्य तत् कौशलं श्रुत्वा धनुर्वेदजिघृक्षवः। राजानो राजपुत्राश्च समाजग्मुः सहस्रशः॥<br />Hearing of his skill, thousands of kings and princes, desirous of learning the science of arms flocked (to him).</p>
<p id='25'>ततो निषादराजस्य हिरण्यधनुषः सुतः। एकलव्यो महाराज द्रोणमभ्याजगाम ह॥<br />O great king, thereupon, Ekalavya, the son of Hiranyadhanu, king of the Nishadas, came to Drona.</p>
<p id='26'>न स तं प्रतिजग्राह नैषादिरिति चिन्तयन्। शिष्यं धनुषि धर्मज्ञस्तेषामेवान्ववेक्षया॥<br />That learned man in all the precepts of religion (Drona) did not accept him (the Nishada prince) as his pupil in archery, thinking that he was a Nishada and considering the interest of the princes.</p>
<p id='27'>स तु द्रोणस्य शिरसा पादौ गृह्य परंतपः। अरण्यमनुसम्प्राप्य कृत्वा द्रोणं महीमयम्॥ तस्मिन्नाचार्यवृत्तिं च परमामास्थितस्तदा। इष्वस्त्रे योगमातस्थे परं नियमास्थितः॥<br />O chastiser of foes, touching Drona's feet with his head, he went into a forest and made a clay statue of Drona. He began to worship it (the clay figure) as if were his real preceptor and before that figure he practiced the use of arms with the most rigid regularity.</p>
<p id='28'>परया श्रद्धयोपेतो योगेन परमेण च। विमोक्षादानसंधाने लघुत्वं परमाप सः॥<br />In consequence of his exceptional reverence for his preceptor and of his devotion to his purpose, all the three processes of fixing arrows on the bow string, aiming and letting off became very easy to him.</p>
<p id='29'>अथ द्रोणाभ्यनुज्ञाताः कदाचित् कुरुपाण्डवाः। ग्थैर्विनिर्ययुः सर्वे मृगयामरिमर्दन॥<br />O chastiser of foes, one day the Kuru and the Pandu princes with the permission of Drona all set out on their cars to a hunting excursion.</p>
