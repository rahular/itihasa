<h3>ASTIKA PARVA: Chapter 23</h3><h4>Story of Garuda</h4><p id='1'>सौतिरुवाच तं समुद्रमतिक्रम्य कर्विनतया सह। न्यपतत्तुरगाभ्याशे न चिरादिव शीघ्रगा॥<br />Sauti said: Kadru, of swift speed, accompanied by Vinata, having crossed the ocean, very soon came to the horse.</p>
<p id='2'>ततस्ते तं हयश्रेष्ठं ददृशाते महाजवम्। शशाङ्ककिरणप्रख्यं कालवालमुभे तदा।॥<br />They then saw that swift and the best of horses, as white as the rays of the moon but with black hairs (in the tail).</p>
<p id='3'>निशम्य च बहून्वालान् कृष्णान्पुच्छसमाश्रितान्। विषण्णरूपां विनतां कदूर्दास्ये न्ययोजयत्॥<br />Seeing many black hairs in the tail, Kadru put much dejected Vinata into slavery.</p>
<p id='4'>ततः सा विनता तस्मिन्पणितेन पराजिता। अभवदुःखसंतप्ता दासीभावं समास्थिता॥<br />Thus having lost wager, Vinata became a slave and became exceedingly sad.</p>
<p id='5'>एतस्मिन्नन्तरे चापि गरुडः काल आगते। विना मात्रा महातेजा विदार्याण्डमजायत॥<br />Meanwhile, when the time came, Garuda of great splendour came out bursting the egg without the help of his mother.</p>
<p id='6'>महासत्त्वबलोपेतः सर्वा विद्योतयन्दिशः। कामरूपः कामगमः कामवीर्यो विहंगमः॥<br />He enkindled all the points of the universe, he was the bird endowed with strength, capable of assuming any form at will, of going every where at will and calling any amount of energy to action at will.</p>
<p id='7'>अग्निराशिरिवोद्भासन्समिद्धोऽतिभयंकरः। विद्युदविस्पष्टपिङ्गाक्षो युगान्ताग्निसमप्रभः॥<br />He looked terrible like a heap of blazing fire, of lustre equal to that of the fire at the end of Yuga. His eyes were bright like the flash of lightning.</p>
<p id='8'>प्रवृद्धः सहसा पक्षी महाकायो नभोगतः। घोरो घोरस्वनो रौद्रो वह्निरौर्व इवापरः॥<br />As soon as he was born, the huge bird, increasing his body, rose to the sky, fearfully roaring like a second ocean-fire.</p>
<p id='9'>तं दृष्ट्वा शरणं जग्मुर्देवाः सर्वे विभावसुम्। प्रणिपत्याब्रुवंश्चैनमासीनं विश्वरूपिणम्॥<br />All the celestials seeing him, sought the protection of Vibhavasu (Agni). They bowed down to that Deity of Universal form who was seated on his seat and addressed him thus:</p>
<p id='10'>अग्ने मा त्वं प्रवर्धिष्ठाः कच्चिन्नो न दिधक्षसि। असौ हि राशिः सुमहान्समिद्धस्तव सर्पति॥<br />“O Agni, do not extend your body. Have you resolved to consume us? Lo, the huge heap of your flames is spreading wide!"</p>
<p id='11'>अग्निरुवाच नैतदेवं यथा यूयं मन्यध्वमसुरार्दनाः। गरुडो बलवानेष मम तुल्यश्च तेजसा॥<br />Agni said : O persecutors of the Asuras, it is not as you think. It is mighty Garuda, equal to me in splendour.</p>
<p id='12'>जातः परमतेजस्वी विनतानन्दवर्धनः। तेजोराशिमिमं दृष्ट्वा युष्मान्मोहः समाविशत्॥<br />He is born endued with great energy to promote the joy of Vinata. Seeing this heap of effulgence, this delusion has come (in you).</p>
<p id='13'>नागक्षयकरश्चैव काश्यपेयो महाबलः। देवानां च हिते युक्तस्त्वहितौ दैत्यरक्षसाम्॥<br />He is the mighty son of Kashyapa, he is the destroyer of the Nagas, the enemy of the Daityas and Rakshasas, he is ever engaged to do good to the celestials.</p>
<p id='14'>न भीः कार्या कथं चात्र पश्यध्वं सहिता मम॥<br />Do not be afraid in the least. Come with me and see him.</p>
<p id='15'>एवमुक्तास्तदा गत्वा गरुडं वाग्भिरस्तुवन्। ते दूरादभ्युपेत्यैनं देवाः सर्षिगणास्तदा॥<br />Sauti said: Thus asked, the celestial went with the Rishis towards Garuda and from a distance addressed him thus.</p>
<p id='16'>देवा ऊचुः त्वमृषिस्त्वं महाभागस्त्वं देवः पतगेश्वरः। त्वं प्रभुस्तपनः सूर्यः परमेष्ठी प्रजापतिः॥<br />The Celestials said: O Lord of birds, you are a Rishi, you are the partaker of the largest portion of the sacrifice, you are Deity. You are Lord of the birds, you are the sun of hot rays, you are Parameshti, you are Prajapati.</p>
<p id='17'>त्वमिन्द्रस्त्वं हयमुखस्त्वं शर्वस्त्वं जगत्पतिः। त्वं मुखं पद्मजो विप्रस्त्वमग्निः पवनस्तथा।॥<br />You are Indra, you are steed-necked Vishnu, you are Shiva, You are the Lord of the universe, you are the principal, you are Brahma and Brahmanas, you are Agni, you are the wind.</p>
<p id='18'>त्वं हि धाता विधाता च त्वं विष्णुः सुरसत्तमः। त्वं महानभिभूः शश्वदमृतं त्वं महद्यशः॥ त्वं प्रभास्त्वमभिप्रेतं त्वं नस्त्राणमनुत्तमम्।<br />You are Dhata and Vidhata, you are Vishnu the best of celestials, you are the great Truth, you are fearless, you are ever unchanged, you are great glory. You are the energy of the sun, you are the intellectual function, you are our great protector.</p>
<p id='19'>बलोमिमान्साधुरदीनसत्त्वः समृद्धिमान्दुर्विषहस्त्वमेव॥<br />You are the ocean of strength, you are purity, you are beyond the attributes and darkness, you are the possessor of all wealth, you are unconquerable.</p>
<p id='20'>त्वत्त: सृतं सर्वमहीनकीर्ते ह्यनागतं चोपगतं च सर्वम्। त्वमुत्तमः सर्वमिदं चराचरं गभस्तिभिर्भानुरिवावभाससे॥<br />From you have emanated all things, you are the doer of excellent acts. You are all that has not been and all that has been. You are pure knowledge, you display as sun by his rays, this animate and inanimate universe.</p>
<p id='21'>समाक्षिपन्भानुमतः प्रभां मुहुः त्वमन्तकः सर्वमिदं ध्रुवाध्रुवम्। दिवाकरः परिकुपितो यथा दहेत् प्रजास्तथा दहसि हुताशनप्रभः॥<br />Darkening the splendour of the sun, you become the destroyer of all; you are all that is perishable and all that is imperishable. O Deity, with the splendour of fire you consume all as sun in his anger burns all creatures.</p>
<p id='22'>भयंकरः प्रलय इवाग्निरुत्थितः विनाशयन्युगपरिवर्तनान्तकृत्॥ खगेश्वरं शरणमुपागता वयं महौजसं ज्वलनसमानवर्चसम्।<br />You rise like the fire which, at the changes of the Yuga and at the dissolution of the creation, destroys everything. O king of birds, having come to you, we seek your protection, you move in the sky, your energy is great, you are as mighty as the fire.</p>
<p id='23'>तडित्प्रभं वितिमिरमभ्रगोचरं महाबलं गरुडमुपेत्य खेचरम्। परावरं वरदमजय्यविक्रम तवौजसा सर्वमिदं प्रतापितम्॥<br />Your brightness is like the lightning. You are the dispeller of darkness, you reach the very clouds, you are mighty bird Garuda. You are both the cause and the effect, you are the dispenser of boons and invincible in prowess.</p>
<p id='24'>जगत्प्रभो तप्तसुवर्णवर्चसा त्वं पाहि सर्वांश्च सुरान्महात्मनः। भयान्विता नभसि विमानगामिनो विमानिता विपथगतिं प्रयान्ति ते॥<br />O Lord of the whole universe, by your brilliance like the heated gold, protect the noble celestials, who having been frightened, are flying along the heaven in all directions.</p>
<p id='25'>ऋषेः सुतस्त्वमसि दयावतः प्रभो महात्मनः खगवर कश्यपस्य ह। स मा क्रुधः कुरु जगतो दयां परां त्वमीश्वरः प्रशममुपैहि पाहि नः॥<br />O best of birds, you are the son, of the merciful and high-souled Rishi Kashyapa, you are the lord of all, therefore do not be angry with the universe, have mercy for it. You are the Supreme Lord, assuage your anger and save us.</p>
<p id='26'>महाशनिस्फुरितसमस्वनेन ते दिशोऽम्बरं त्रिदिवमियं च मेदिनी। चलन्ति नः खगहृद्यानि चानिशं निगृह्यतां वपुरिदमग्निसंनिभम्॥<br />The ten points, the skies, the heavens, the earth and our hearts, O bird, are continuously trembling at your voice, loud as the roar of thunder. Diminish your body which is like the fire.</p>
<p id='27'>तव द्युतिं कुपितकृतान्तसंनिभां निशम्य नश्चलति मनोऽव्यवस्थितम्॥<br />Our hearts, losing all equanimity, are trembling at your splendour, resembling that of the angry Yama.</p>
<p id='28'>प्रसीद नः पतगपते प्रयाचतां शिवश्च नो भव भगवन्सुखावहः। एवं स्तुतः सुपर्णस्तु देवैः सर्षिगणैस्तदा तेजसः प्रतिसंहारमात्मनः स चकार ह॥<br />O king of birds, we pray to you, be kind towards us. Bestow on us, O Bhagavan, benefit, fortune and happiness. Having been thus adored by all the celestials and Rishis, the bird, of beautiful feathers, diminished his own energy and splendour.</p>
