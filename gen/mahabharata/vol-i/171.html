<p id='30'>जन्मप्रभृति यत् किंचिद् दृष्टवान् स महीपतिः। रूपं न सदृशं तस्यास्तर्कयामास किंचन॥<br />Nothing that the king has seen from the day of his birth could equal, he argued, the beauty of that girl.</p>
<p id='31'>तया बद्धमनुश्चक्षुः पाशैर्गुणमयैस्तदा। न चचाल ततो देशाद् बुबुधे न च किंचन॥ अस्या नूनं विशालाक्ष्याः सदेवासुरमानुषम्। लोकं निर्मथ्य धात्रेदं रूपमाविष्कृतं कृतम्॥<br />(He thought) “The creator has created the beauty of this beautiful eyed maiden after churning the whole world of the Devas and the Asuras and the human beings." The king's heart and eyes were captivated by that maiden, as if they became bound in ropes; he remained rooted to the spot deprived of his senses.</p>

<p id='36'>त्वं हि सर्वानवद्याङ्गी सर्वाभरणभूषिता। विभूषणमिवैतेषां भूषणानामभीप्सितम्॥ न देवी नासुरां चैव न यक्षी न च राक्षसीम्। न च भोगवतीं मन्ये न गन्धर्वी न मानुषीम्॥<br />You are perfectly faultless in your every feature; decked in every ornament, you seem to be the coveted ornament of those ornaments themselves. You seem to be not a Devi or an Asuri, or a Lakshmi, or a Rakshasi; you are not a Nagini or a Gandharvi or a Manushi.</p>
<p id='37'>या हि दृष्टा मया काश्चिच्छ्रुता वापि वराङ्गनाः। न तासां सदृशीं मन्ये मत्वामहं मत्तकाशिनि॥<br />O excellent lady, the best of women that I have seen or heard of can not equal you in beauty.</p>

<p id='39'>एवं तां स महीपालो बभाषे न तु सा तदा। कामार्तं निर्जनेऽरण्ये प्रत्यभाषत किंचन॥<br />The Gandharva said : The king, oppressed desire, thus addressed her in the solitary woods, but the did not speak a word in reply.</p>
<p id='40'>ततो लालप्यमानस्य पार्थिवस्यायतेक्षणा। सौदामिनीव चाभ्रेषु तत्रैवान्तरधीयत॥<br />When the king repeatedly asked her thus, the large-eyed maiden quickly disappeared in the very sight of the king like a flash of lightning.</p>
<p id='41'>तामन्वेष्टुं स नृपतिः परिचक्राम सर्वतः। वनं वनजपत्राक्षीं भ्रमन्नुन्मत्तवत् तदा।॥<br />The king then, like one who has loss his reason, wandered through the whole forest in search of that lotus eyed maiden.</p>
<p id='42'>अपश्यमानः स तु तां बहु तत्र विलप्य च। निश्चेष्टः पार्थिवश्रेष्ठो मुहूर्तं स व्यतिष्ठत॥<br />Having failed to find her, that best of kings gave vent to much lamentations and he remained motionless in grief for sometime.</p>
