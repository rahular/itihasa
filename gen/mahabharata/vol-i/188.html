<h3>SVYAIMVARA PARVA: Chapter 188</h3><h4>Hitting of the target</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच यदा निवृत्ता राजानो धनुषः सज्यकर्मणः। अथोदतिष्ठद् विप्राणां मध्याज्जिष्णुरुदारधीः॥<br />Vaishampayana said : When all the kings desisted from the attempt to string the bow, the high-souled nas.</p>
<p id='2'>उदक्रोशन् विप्रमुख्या विधुन्वन्तोऽजिनानि च। दृष्ट्वा सम्प्रस्थितं पार्थमिन्द्रकेतुसमप्रभम्॥<br />Seeing him (Arjuna) possess the complexion of Indra's banner and observing that he was advancing towards the bow, the chief Brahmanas made a loud uproar by shaking their deer skins.</p>
<p id='3'>केचिदासन् विमनसः केचिदासन् मुदान्विताः। आहुः परस्परं केचिन्निपुणा बुद्धिजीविनः॥<br />While some of them were pleased, others were displeased and some among them possessing intelligence and foresight talked to one another thus,</p>
<p id='4'>यत् कर्णशल्यप्रमुखैः क्षत्रियैर्लोकविश्रुतैः। नानतं बलवदभिर्हि धनुर्वेदपरायणैः॥ तत् कथं त्वकृतास्त्रेण प्राणतो दुर्बलीयसा। बटुमात्रेण शक्यं हि सज्यं कर्तुं धनुर्द्विजाः॥<br />“How can a stripping of a Brahmana unpractised in arms and weak a strength, string that bow which such celebrated Kshatriyas like Shalya and others endued with great might and accomplished in the science and practice of arms could not string?</p>
<p id='5'>अवहास्या भविष्यन्ति ब्राह्मणाः सर्वराजसु। कर्मण्यस्मिन्नसंसिद्धे चापलादपरीक्षिते॥<br />If he fails to achieve success in the act which he has undertaken by his boyish restlessness the Brahmanas will be ridiculous in the eyes of all the kings.</p>
<p id='6'>योष दर्पाद्धर्षाद् वाप्यथ ब्राह्मणचापलात्। प्रस्थितो धनुरायन्तुं वार्यतां साधु मा गमत्॥<br />Therefore stop this Brahmana and prevent him from attempting to string the bow, which he (surely) desires to do out of vanity, childish daring and mere restlessness.</p>
<p id='7'>नावहास्या भविष्यामो न च लाघवमास्थिताः। न च विद्विष्टतां लोके गमिष्यामो महीक्षिताम्॥<br />The Brahmana said: We shall not be ridiculous, nor shall we incur the disrespect of any body, or the displeasure of the sovereigns.</p>
<p id='8'>केचिदाहुर्युवा श्रीमान् नागराजकरोपमः। पीनस्कन्धोरुबाहुश्च धैर्येण हिमवानिव॥<br />Vaishampayana said : The others said, This handsome youth, who is like a truck of a mighty elephant, whose shoulders, arms and thighs are so well built, who is patience looks like the Himalayas,</p>
<p id='9'>सिंहखेलगतिः श्रीमान् मत्तनागेन्द्रविक्रमः। सम्भाव्यमस्मिन् कर्मेदमुत्साहाच्चानुमीयते॥<br />Whose gait is like that of the lion, whose prowess is like that of a mad elephant and who is so resolute, will probably accomplish the feat.</p>
<p id='10'>शक्तिरस्य महोत्साहा न ह्यशक्तः स्वयं व्रजेत्। न च तद्विद्यते किंचित् कर्म लोकेषु यद्भवेत्॥ ब्राह्मणानामसाध्यं च नृषु संस्थानचारिषु। अब्भक्षा वायुभक्षाश्च फलाहारा दृढव्रताः॥<br />He has (surely great) strength and great energy, else he would not have gone of his own accord. There is nothing in the three worlds that Brahmanas among all mortal men cannot accomplish. Abstaining from food, living on air, eating fruits, observing severe vows,</p>
<p id='11'>दुर्बला अपि विप्रा हि बलीयांस: स्वतेजसा। ब्राह्मणो नावमन्तव्यः सदसद् वा समाचरन्॥<br />And becoming emaciated and weak the Brahmanas are ever strong in their own energy. A Brahmana should never be disregarded whether his acts be right or wrong,</p>
<p id='12'>सुखं दुःखं महद्भस्वं कर्म यत् समुपागतम्। जामदग्न्येन रामेण निर्जिताः क्षत्रिया युधि॥<br />None should consider him incapable of achieving any task that is great or little, blissful or woeful. All the Kshatriyas were defeated in battle by Rama, the son of Jamadagni.</p>
<p id='13'>पीतः समुद्रोऽगस्त्येन ह्यगाधो ब्रह्मतेजसा। तस्माद् ब्रुवन्तु सर्वेऽत्र बटुरेष धनुर्महान्॥ आरोपयतु शीघ्रं वै तथेत्यूचुर्द्विजर्षभाः। एवं तेषां विलपतां विप्राणां विविधा गिरः॥<br />Agastya drank up the unfathomable ocean by his Brahma might. Therefore say, “Let this youth bend the bow and string it with ease.” The best of the Brahmanas said, “Be it so." The Brahmanas continued to talk thus to one another and on various matters.</p>
<p id='14'>अर्जुनो धनुषोऽभ्याशे तस्थौ गिरिरिवाचलः। स तद् धनुः परिक्रम्य प्रदक्षिणमथाकरोत्॥ प्रणम्य शिरसा देवमीशानं वरदं प्रभुम्। कृष्णं च मनसा कृत्वा जगृहे चार्जुनो धनुः॥<br />Arjuna came to the bow and stood there like a mountain. Walking round that row in due form, bowing his head to the giver of boons, lord Ishana and remembering Krishna in his mind, he took up the bow.</p>
<p id='15'>यत् पार्थिवै रुक्मसुनीथवरैः राधेयदुर्योधनशल्यशाल्वैः। तदा धनुर्वेदपरैर्नृसिंहैः कृतं न सज्यं महतोऽपि यत्नात्॥<br />The bow which Rukma, Sunitha, Vakra, Radha's son (Karna), Duryodhana, Shalya and many other kings, accomplished in the science and practice of arms, could not string, even with great exertion, was stringed within the twinkling of an eye,</p>
<p id='16'>स्तदैन्द्रिरिन्द्रावरजप्रभावः। सज्यं च चक्रे निमिषान्तरेण शरांश्च जग्राह दशार्धसंख्यान्॥<br />By Arjuna, the son of Indra, that foremost of all powerful men, that hero as powerful as the younger brother of Indra. He took up the five arrows,</p>
<p id='17'>विव्याध लक्ष्यं निपपात तच्च छिद्रेण भूमौ सहसातिविद्धम्। ततोऽन्तरिक्षे च बभूव नादः समाजमध्ये च महान् निनादः॥<br />Shot the mark and caused it to come down on the ground through the orifice the machinery above over which it had been placed. Thereupon rose a great uproar in the sky and also a great clamour in the arena.</p>
<p id='18'>पुष्पाणि दिव्यानि ववर्ष देवः पार्थस्य मूर्ध्नि द्विषतां निहन्तुः॥<br />The celestials showed celestials flowers on the head of that slayer of foes Arjuna.</p>
<p id='19'>चैलानि विव्यधुस्तत्र ब्राह्मणाश्च सहस्रशः। विलक्षितास्ततश्चक्रुर्हाहाकारांश्च सर्वशः। न्यपतंश्चात्र नभसः समन्तात् पुष्पवृष्टयः॥ शताङ्गानि च तूर्याणि वादकाः समवादयन्। सूतमागधसङ्घाश्चाप्यस्तुवंस्तत्र सुस्वराः॥<br />Thousands of Brahmanas waved their upper garments in joy. The assembled kings uttered exclamations of grief and despair. Flowers were rained from the sky all over the arena. The musicians struck up in concert hundreds of drums and trumpets. The bard and the herald began to chant the praise of the hero in sweet stain.</p>
<p id='20'>तं दृष्ट्वा दुपदः प्रीतो बभूव रिपुसूदनः। सह सैन्यैश्च पार्थस्य साहाय्यार्थमियेष सः॥<br />Seeing him (Arjuna), that chastiser of foes, Draupada, became exceedingly glad and he desired to assist Partha with his army in occasion arose.</p>
<p id='21'>तस्मिंस्तु शब्दे महति प्रवृद्धे युधिष्ठिरो धर्मभृतां वरिष्ठः। आवासमेवोपजगाम शीघ्र सार्धं यमाभ्यां पुरुषोत्तमाभ्याम्॥<br />When the uproar was at its highest, that foremost of all virtuous men Yudhishthira accompanied by those foremost of men, the twins, soon left the arena to return to his lodging.</p>
<p id='22'>विद्धं तु लक्ष्यं प्रसमीक्ष्य कृष्णा पार्थं च शक्रप्रतिमं निरीक्ष्य। आदाय शुक्लं वरमाल्यदाम जगाम कुन्तीसुतमुत्स्मयन्ती॥<br />Seeing the mark shot and seeing also Partha who had shot the mark like Indra himself, Krishna (Draupadi) was filled with joy; and she came to the son of Kunti with a white robe and a garland of flowers.</p>
<p id='23'>स तामुपादाय विजित्य रङ्गे द्विजातिभिस्तैरभिपूज्यमानः। रङ्गानिरक्रामदचिन्त्यकर्मा पत्न्या तया चाप्यनुगम्यमानः॥<br />That accomplisher, of inconceivable feats, having won her in the arena, was saluted with reverence by all the Brahmanas. He soon after left arena and was followed by her who thus became his wife.</p>
