<h3>SAMBHAVA PARVA: Chapter 108</h3><h4>History of Animandavya</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच ततः स मुनिशार्दूलस्तानुवाच तपोधनान्। दोषतः कं गमिष्यामि न हि मेऽन्योऽपराध्यति॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Thereupon, that best of Rishis thus replied to the ascetics, "Whom shall I blame? None is to blame."</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>तं दृष्ट्वा रक्षिणस्तत्र तथा बहुतिथेऽहनि। न्यवेदयंस्तथा राज्ञे यथावृत्तं नराधिप॥<br />O king, the guards, having seen him after many days in that state, told the king all that had happened.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>श्रुत्वा च वचनं तेषां निश्चित्य सह मन्त्रिभिः। प्रसादयामास तथा शूलस्थमृषिसत्तमम्॥<br />Having heard their words, the king after consulting with his ministers, gratified that excellent Rishi fixed on the Shula.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>राजोवाच यन्मयापकृतं मोहादज्ञानादृषिसत्तम। प्रसादये त्वां तत्राहं न मे त्वं क्रोद्भुमर्हसि।॥<br />The king said : O best of Rishis, I have offended you out of ignorance. I beseech you, pardon me. You should not be angry with me.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच एवमुक्तस्ततो राज्ञा प्रसादमकरोन्मुनिः। कृतप्रसादं राजा तं ततः समवतारयत्॥ अवतार्य च शूलाग्रात् तच्छूलं निश्चकर्ष ह। अशक्नुवंश्च निष्क्रष्टुं शूलं मूले च चिच्छिदे॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Having been thus addressed by the king, the Rishi was gratified. Having thus gratified him, the king took down the Shula and tried to draw it out from him but he was unable to do it.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>स तथान्तर्गतेनैव शूलेन व्यतरन्मुनिः। तेनातितपसा लोकान् विजिग्ये दुर्लभान् परैः॥<br />The Rishi in that state with Shula practised the austerest penances and he thus conquered by his asceticism many regions difficult to be obtained.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>अणीमाण्डव इति च ततो लोकेषु गीयते। स गत्वा सदनं विप्रो धर्मस्य परमात्मवित्॥ आसनस्थं ततो धर्मं दृष्ट्वोपालभत प्रभुः। किं नु तद् दुष्कृतं कर्म मया कृतमजानता॥ यस्येयं फलनिर्वृत्तिरीदृश्यासादिता मया। शीघ्रमाचक्ष्व मे तत्त्वं पश्य मे तपसो बलम्॥<br />Therefore, he called earth Animandavya. That great truth-knowing Brahmana (one day) went to Dharma (the god of justice). Seeing the god seated on his seat, the lord (Rishi) asked him reproachingly, "What is the sinful act which has been committed unconsciously by me. For which I am suffering from this punishment? Tell me without delay and then see my ascetic power." was on</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>धर्म उवाच पतङ्गिकानां पुच्छेषु त्वयेषीका प्रवेशिता। कर्मणस्तस्य ते प्राप्तं फलमेतत् तपोधन॥<br />Dharma said : O ascetic, a little insect was once pierced by you with a blade of grass; you now receive the fruit of your action.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>अणीमाण्डव्य उवाच अल्पेऽपराधेऽपि महान् मम दण्डस्त्वया कृतः। शूद्रयोनावतो धर्म मानुषः सम्भविष्यसि। मर्यादां स्थापयाम्यद्य लोके धर्मफलोदयाम्॥ आ चतुर्दशकाद् वर्षान्न भविष्यति पातकम्। परतः कुर्वतामेवं दोष एव भविष्यति॥<br />Animandavya said : You have inflicted upon me a great punishment for a little fault. Therefore o Dharma, you will be born as a man in the womb of a Shudra woman. I establish this rule today on earth in respect of the consequences of one's act that no sin will be committed in any act done by a man below the age of fourteen years. When committed only above that age, it will be sin.”</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच एतेन त्वपराधेन शापात् तस्य महात्मनः। धर्मो विदुररूपेण शूद्रयोनावजायत॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Being cursed by that illustrious man for this fault, Dharma was born as Vidura in the womb of a Shudra woman.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>धर्मे चार्थे च कुशलो लोभक्रोधविवर्जितः। दीर्घदर्शी शमपरः कुरूणां च हिते रतः॥<br />He (Vidura) was learned in Dharma and Artha; he was free from avarice and anger; he was fore-seeing, tranquil in mind and ever engaged in doing good to the Kurus.</p>
