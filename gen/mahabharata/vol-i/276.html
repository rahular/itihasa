<h3>SHISHUPALA VADHA: Chapter 42</h3><h4>Wrath of Bhima</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>शिशुपाल उवाच स मे बहुमतो राजा जरासंधो महाबलः। योऽनेन युद्धं नेयेष दासोऽयमिति संयुगे॥<br />Shishupala said The greatly powerful king Jarasandha, who did not desire to fight with Krishna, saying that he was but a “servant”, was (surely) worthy of my greatest esteem.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>केशवेन कृतं कर्म जरासंधवधे तदा। भीमसेनार्जुनाभ्यां च कस्तत् साध्विति मन्यते॥<br />Who will consider praiseworthy the act of killing Jarasandha which was done by Keshava (Krishna), as also by Bhima and Arjuna?</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>अद्वारेण प्रविष्टेन छद्मना ब्रह्मवादिना। दृष्टः प्रभावः कृष्णेन जरासंधस्य भूपतेः॥<br />Entering (the city) by a way which was not the (public) gate, and disguised as a Vedaknowing (Brahmana), this Krishna saw the prowess of king Jarasandha.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>येन धर्मात्मनाऽऽत्मानं ब्रह्मण्यमविजानता। नेषितं पाद्यमस्मै तद् दातुमग्रे दुरात्मने।॥<br />When that illustrious king offered this wretch water to wash his feet, it was then he said from seeming motives of virtue that he was not a Brahmana.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>भुज्यतामिति तेनोक्ताः कृष्णभीमधनंजयाः। जरासंधेन कौरव्य कृष्णेन विकृतं कृतम्॥<br />O descendant of Kuru, when Bhima, Dhananjaya and Krishna were asked by Jarasandha to eat, that request was refused by this Krishna.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>यद्ययं जगतः कर्ता यथैनं मूर्ख मन्यसे। कस्मान्न ब्राह्मणं सम्यगात्मानमवगच्छति॥<br />If this one (Krishna) is the lord of the universe, as this fool thinks himself to be, why does he not then consider himself a Brahmana?</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>इदं त्वाश्चर्यभूतं मे यदिमे पाण्डवास्त्वया। अपकृष्टाः सतां मार्गान्प्रन्यन्ते तच्च साध्विति॥<br />It is greatly surprising that though you often lead the Pandavas away from the path of the pious, yet they consider you (Bhima) to be honest.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>अथ वा नैतदाश्चर्यं येषां त्वमसि भारत। स्त्रीसधर्मा च वृद्धश्च सर्वार्थानां प्रदर्शकः॥<br />Odescendant of Bharata (Bhishma), there is nothing to be surprising (perhaps) in those who have got you, who is no better than a woman and who is old, to be their counsellor in all things.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच तस्य तद् वचनं श्रुत्वा रूक्षं रूक्षाक्षरं बहु। चुकोप बलिनां श्रेष्ठो भीमसेनः प्रतापवान्॥<br />Vaishampayana said Hearing his these harsh words-harsh both in import and sound, that foremost of all strong men, the powerful Bhimasena, became angry.</p>

<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>दन्तान् संदशतस्तस्य कोपाद् ददृशुराननम्। युगान्ते सर्वभूतानि कालस्येव जिघत्सतः॥<br />When he began to grind his teeth in anger, the kings saw his face resemble like that of the Death preparing to swallow every creature at the end of the Yuga.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>उत्पतन्तं तु वेगेन जग्राहैनं मनस्विनम्। भीष्म एव महाबाहुर्महासेनमिवेश्वरः॥<br />As the strong-minded (hero) was about to jump up with great impetuosity, the mighty armed Bhishma caught him (by the hand), as if Mahadeva seized Mahasena.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>तस्य भीमस्य भीष्मेण वार्यमाणस्य भारत। गुरुणा विविधैर्वाक्यैः क्रोधः प्रशममागतः॥<br />O descendant of Bharata, Bhima's anger was soon appeased by Bhishma with various words of sound counsels.</p>

<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>उत्पतन्तं तु वेगेन पुन: पुनररिंदमः। न स तं चिन्तयामास सिंहः क्रुद्धो मृगं यथा।॥<br />Though Bhima every moment jumping up (from his seat) with great impetuosity, yet Shishupala did not bestow a single thought on him, as a lion does not mind a small animal who leaps up in rage.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>प्रहसंश्चाब्रवीद् वाक्यं चेदिराजः प्रतापवान्। भीमसेनमभिक्रुद्धं दृष्ट्वा भीमपराक्रमम्॥<br />Seeing Bhima of terrible prowess in such great rage, the mighty kings of Chedi laughingly spoke thus. was</p>
