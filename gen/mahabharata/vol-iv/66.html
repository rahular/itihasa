<h3>BHISHMAVADHA PARVA: Chapter 65</h3><h4>The eulogy to Vishnu,</h4><p id='1'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच भयं मे सुमहज्जातं विस्मयश्चैव संजय। श्रुत्वा पाण्डुकुमाराणां कर्म देवैः सुदुष्करम्॥<br />Dhritarashtra said Hearing of those feats achieved by the sons of Pandu-feats which are difficult of being achieved even by the celestial themselves, O Sanjaya, I have been filled with apprehension and amazement.</p>
<p id='2'>पुत्राणां च पराभावं श्रुत्वा संजय सर्वशः। चिन्ता मे महती सूत भविष्यति कथं त्विति॥<br />Hearing also of the humiliation of my sons in every way. O Sanjaya, I have been seized by a burning anxiety as to what the finale (of this war) will be.</p>
<p id='3'>ध्रुवं विदुरवाक्यानि धक्ष्यन्ति हृदयं मम। यथा हि दृश्यते सर्वं दैवयोगेन संजय॥<br />The prophecy of Vidura does consume my heart; and, O Sanjaya, I see that through the influence of (adverse) destiny every thing is happening even as he had said.</p>
<p id='4'>यत्र भीष्पमुखान् सर्वाञ्छस्त्रज्ञानं योधसत्तमान्। पाण्डवानामनीकेषु योधयन्ति प्रहारिणः॥<br />The smiters of the Pandava hosts are battling with those foremost of warriors headed by Bhishma, who are endued with heroism and accomplished in (the use of) all weapons.</p>
<p id='5'>केनावध्या महात्मानः पाण्डुपुत्रा महाबलाः। केन दत्तवरास्तात किं वा ज्ञानं विदन्ति ते॥<br />What asceticism those high-souled and greatly powerful sons of Pandu have observed, what boon, O child, have they secured, what knowledge have they cultivated,</p>
<p id='6'>येन क्षयं न गच्छन्ति दिवि तारागणा इव। पुनः पुनर्न मृष्यामि हतं सैन्यं तु पाण्डवैः।<br />In consequences of which they suffer no reduction, like the stars in the firmament? I can not bear the repeated slaughter of my warriors by the sons of Pandu.</p>
<p id='7'>मय्येव दण्डः पतति दैवात् परमदारुणः। यथाऽवध्याः पाण्डुसुता यथा वध्याश्च मे सुताः॥ एतन्मे सर्वमाचक्ष्व याथातथ्येन संजय। न हि पारं प्रपश्यामि दुःखस्यास्य कथंचन॥<br />Through the disposal of Destiny, a highly severe chastisement has overtaken me alone. Tell me truly, O Sanjaya, every thing, about why my sons have become liable to slaughter and why the sons of Pandus have been exempted from it. I can not discern, O afflicter of your enemies, the termination of this ocean of distress.</p>
<p id='8'>समुद्रस्येव महतो भुजाभ्यां प्रतरन् नरः। पुत्राणां व्यसनं मन्ये ध्रुवं प्राप्तं सुदारुणम्॥<br />Like a man desirous of swimming over the vast sea with his two arms. I now certainly see that a terrible calamity has overtaken my sons.</p>
<p id='9'>घातयिष्यति मे सर्वान् पुत्रान् भीमो न संशयः। न हि पश्यामि तं वीरं यो मे रक्षेत् सुतान् रणे॥<br />No doubt, Bhima will slay all my sons. I do not find that hero who can protect my sons in battle.</p>
<p id='10'>ध्रुवं विनाशः सम्प्राप्तः पुत्राणां मम संजय। तस्मान्मे कारणं सूत शक्तिं चैव विशेषतः॥ पृच्छतो वै यथातत्त्वं सर्वमाख्यातुमर्हसि। दुर्योधनश्च यच्चक्रे दृष्ट्वा स्वान् विमुखान् रणे॥<br />The destruction of my sons in battle is certain, O Sanjaya. Therefore, O Suta, it behaves you to tell me who am questioning you, in detail and truly, the real cause of these events, as also, what Duryodhana did, seeing his own troops turn their face away from the field of battle.</p>
<p id='11'>भीष्मद्रोणौ कृपश्चैव सौबलश्च जयद्रथः। द्रौणिर्वाऽपि महेष्वासो विकर्णो वा महाबलः॥<br />Bhishma, Drona, Kripa and the son of Subala, and Jayadratha, and the mighty bowman the son of Drona, and the mighty Vikarna, what did all these warriors do?</p>
<p id='12'>निश्चयो वापि कस्तेषां तदा ह्यासीन्महात्मनाम्। विमुखेषु महाप्राज्ञ मम पुत्रेषु संजय॥<br />What, O highly wise one, the resolution of these high-souled warriors, when, O Sanjaya, my sons turned away their faces from the field? was</p>
<p id='13'>संजय उवाच शृणु राजन्नवहितः श्रुत्वा चैवावधारय। नैव मन्त्रकृतं किंचिन्नैव मायां तथाविधाम्॥<br />Sanjaya said Hear, O king, with perfect attention and hearing do you understand what you hear. There was nothing the result of incantation and nothing the production of illusion.</p>
<p id='14'>न वै विभीषिकां कांचिद् राजन् कुर्वन्ति पाण्डवाः। युध्यन्ति ते यथान्यायं शक्तिमन्तश्च संयुगे॥<br />Neither, O monarch, did the sons of Pandu create any new source of apprehension. Those warriors endued with strength are fighting their battles according to the rules of fair combat.</p>
<p id='15'>धर्मेण सर्वकार्याणि आरभनते सदा पार्थाः जीवितादीनि भारत प्रार्थयाना महद् यशः॥<br />The sons of Pritha, O Bharata, desirous of securing illustrious fame, ever perform all acts, even the maintenance of their lives, in perfect accordance with the rulers of morality.</p>

<p id='17'>तेनावध्या रणे पार्था जययुक्ताश्च पार्थिव। तव पुत्रा दुरात्मानः पापेष्वभिरताः सदा॥<br />For this reason, O ruler of earth, the sons of Pritha are unslayable in battle and are ever courted by victory. Your sons are of wicked intentions and are intent on perpetrating sin;</p>
<p id='18'>निष्ठुरा हीनकर्माणस्तेन हीयन्ति संयुगे। सुबहूनि नृशंसानि पुत्रैस्तव नजनेश्वर॥ निकृतानीह पाण्डूनां नीचैरिव यथा नरैः। सर्वं च तदनादृत्य पुत्राणां तव किल्बिषम्॥<br />And are cruel and of low deeds; therefore are they always worsted in the battle. O ruler of men, various heartless injuries were done to the Pandavas by your sons, like men of low extraction. Disregarding all those offences of your sons.</p>
