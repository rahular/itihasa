<p id='80'><a href='#80'></a>तथा मर्मातिगैर्भीष्मो निजघान महारथान्। कम्पयन् समरे सेनां पाण्डवानां परंतपः॥<br />The highly powerful Bhishma also show in that battle mighty car-warriors with shafts capable of penetrating into the very vitals, agitating the whole host of the Pandavas.</p>
<p id='81'><a href='#81'></a>तेन यौधिष्ठिरे सैन्ये बहवो मानवा हताः। दन्तिनः सादिनश्चैव रथिनोऽथ हयास्तथा॥<br />By him (Bhishma) many warriors and tuskers, and horse-soldiers and car-warriors and steeds of Yudhisthira's army, were slain.</p>
<p id='82'><a href='#82'></a>तत्र भारत भीष्मस्य रणे दृष्ट्वा पराक्रमम्। अत्यद्भुतमपश्याम शक्रस्येव पराक्रमम्॥ तथैव भीमसेनस्य पार्षतस्य च भारत। रौद्रमासीद् रणे युद्ध सात्यकस्य च धन्विनः॥<br />In that battle, O Bharata, we beheld the prowess of Bhishma, of Bhimasena and also, O Bharata, of the son of Prishata. The battle that mighty bowmen of the Satvata race namely Satyaki, fought, was indeed very fierce.</p>
<p id='83'><a href='#83'></a>दृष्ट्वा द्रोणस्य विक्रान्तं पाण्डवान् भयमाविशत्। एक एव रणे शक्तो निहन्तु सर्वसैनिकान्॥ किं पुनः पृथिवीशूर्योधव्रातः समावृतः।<br />Beholding the prowess of Drona, the Pandavas were seized with terror. Singlehanded can this Drona slay us in battle with all our soldiers; what to speak of him when he is supported by a large body of warriors of worldspread renown.</p>
<p id='84'><a href='#84'></a>इत्युब्रुवन् महाराज रणे द्रोणेन पीडिताः॥ वर्तमाने तथा रौद्रे संग्रामे भरतर्षभ।<br />Even these were the words that the sons of Pritha said, O monarch, when o foremost of the Bharatas, they were greatly afflicted by him in that fierce fight.</p>
<p id='85'><a href='#85'></a>उभयोः सेनयोः शूरा नामृष्यन्त परस्परम्॥ आविष्टा इव युध्यन्ते रक्षोभूता महाबलाः।<br />All the heroes endued with great strength, of those two armies, did not give or take quarter; they fought on as if possessed by Rakshasas or evil spirits.</p>
<p id='86'><a href='#86'></a>तावकाः पाण्डवेयाश्च संरब्धास्तात धन्विनः॥ न स्म पश्यामहे कंचितं प्राणान् यः परिरक्षति। संग्रामे दैत्यसंकाशे तस्मिन् वीरवरक्षये॥<br />And, O sire, the bowmen of your army and those belonging to the army of the Pandavas, were all excited to the highest pitch of fury. We indeed did not then find any one pay the least heed to his life in that battle destructive of heroes, and that resembled the fight of the Daityas themselves.</p>
