To them that stood there as spectators, the king (Duryodhana) thus exclaimed. “Either Shveta or Bhishma will die (to day)". Having heard the words of the king, the great car-warriors soon with four kinds of troops advanced to protect the son of Ganga. O descendant of Bharata, Balhika, Kritavarina, Kripa, Shalya, the son of Jarasandha, Vikarna, Chitrasena and Vivingshati, all with great speed, surrounded him on all sides and poured a continuous shower of arrows. That highsouled and mighty warrior then soon checked those wrathful warriors with sharp arrows by displaying his own lightness of hands. Checking them all as a lion checks a herd of elephants, Shveta cut off Bhishma's bow with a thick shower of arrows.</p>
<p id='51'>ततोऽन्यद् धनुरादाय भीष्मः शान्तनवो युधि॥ श्वेतं विव्याध राजेन्द्र कङ्कपत्रैः शितैः शरैः। ततः सेनापतिः क्रुद्धो भीष्मं बहुभिरायसैः॥ विव्याध समरे राजन् सर्वलोकस्य पश्यतः। ततः प्रव्यथितो राजा भीष्मं दृष्ट्वा निवारितम्॥ । प्रवीरं सर्वलोकस्य श्वेतेन युधि वै तदा। निष्ठानकश्च सुमहांस्तव सैन्यस्य चाभवत्॥ तं वीरं वारितं दृष्ट्वा श्वेतेन शरविक्षतम्। हतं श्वेतेन मन्यन्ते श्वेतस्य वशमागतम्॥<br />Then the son of Shantanu, Bhishma, took up another bow in that battle and wounded Shveta with arrows, furnished with the feather of Kanka birds.
