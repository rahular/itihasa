<h3>BHAGAVADGITA PARVA: Chapter 24</h3><h4>Colloquy between Dhritarashtra and Sanjaya</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच केषां प्रहृष्टास्तत्राग्रे योधा युध्यन्ति संजय। उदग्रमनसः के वा के वा दीना विचेतसः॥<br />Dhritarashtra said O Sanjaya, the warriors of which side first advanced to the fight? Whose hearts were filled with confidence and who were spiritless from melancholy?</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>के पूर्वं प्राहरंस्तत्र युद्धे हृदयकम्पने। मामकाः पाण्डवेया वा तन्ममाचक्ष्व संजय॥<br />In the great battle that makes every one's heart tremble, who were they who struck the first blow; were they my men or did they belong to the Pandavas? O Sanjaya, tell me all this in detail.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>कस्य सेनासमुदये गन्धमाल्यसमुद्भवः। वाचः प्रदक्षिणाश्चैव योधानामभिगर्जताम्॥<br />Among whose troops did the garlands of flowers and unguents emit fragrant scents? Whose troops with fearful roars uttered merciful words?</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>संजय उवाच व्यूढानां उभयोः सेनयोस्तत्र योधा जहषिरे तदा। स्रजः समाः सुगन्धानामुभयत्र समुद्भवः॥ संहतानामनीकानां भरतर्षभ। संसर्गात् समुदीर्णानां विमर्दः सुमहानभूत्॥<br />Sanjaya said The warriors of both the armies were cheerful in the beginning. The garlands of flowers and unguents emitted equal fragrance. O best of the Bharata race, fearful was the encounter that took place between the troops arrayed for battle.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>वादित्रशब्दस्तुमुलः शङ्खभेरीविमिश्रितः। शूराणां रणशूराणां गर्जतामितरेतरम्। उभयोः सेनयो राजन् महान् व्यतिकरोऽभवत्॥<br />The loud sounds of musical instruments, mingled with that of the conches and drums, and the shouts of brave warriors, that rose fearfully roaring at one another, were awful.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>अन्योन्यं वीक्ष्यमाणानां योधानां भरतर्षभ। कुञ्जराणां च नदतां सैन्यानां च प्रहृष्यताम्॥<br />O best of the Bharata race, dreadful was the battle fought by the troops of both parties all staring at one another and all filled with joy. The elephants uttered terrible roars.</p>
