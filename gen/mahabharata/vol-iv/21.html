Against whom did the beasts of prey utter inauspicious sounds? Who were those young heroes whose countenances were ever cheerful? Tell me all this in detail.</p>
<p id='3'>संजय उवाच उभे सेने तुल्यमिवोपयाते उभे व्यूहे हृष्टरूपे नरेन्द्र। उभे चित्रे वनराजिप्रकाशे तथैवोभे नागरथाश्वपूर्णे॥<br />Sanjaya said O king, when placed in battle-array, both the armies were equally cheerful. Both the armies looked equally beautiful. They looked like two blossoming woods, and they were full of elephants, cars and horses.</p>
