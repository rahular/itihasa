<h3>BHISHMA-VADHA PARVA: Chapter 107</h3><h4>Termination of the ninth day's battle</h4><p id='1'>संजय उवाच ततः पिता तव क्रुद्धो निशितैः सायकोत्तमैः। आजघान रणे पार्थान् सहसेनान् समन्ततः॥ भीमं द्वादशभिर्विद्ध्वा सात्यकिं नवभिः शरैः। नकुलं च त्रिभिर्विद्ध्वा सहदेवं च सप्तभिः॥<br />Sanjaya said Thereupon your father, waxing worth, began to pierce the sons of Pritha and their troops, with excellent shafts of exceeding sharpness. Piercing Bhima with twelve, Satyaki with nine shafts, Nakula with three, Sahadeva with seven, he pierced.</p>
<p id='2'>युधिष्ठिरं द्वादशभिर्बाह्वोरुरसि चार्पयत्। धृष्टद्युम्नं ततो विद्ध्वा ननाद सुमहाबलः॥ तं द्वादशाख्यैर्नकुलो माधवश्च त्रिभिः शरैः। धृष्टद्युम्नश्च सप्तत्या भीमसेनश्च सप्तभिः॥<br />Yudhishthira with twelve shafts on the arms and on the breast. Then that highly powerful hero, having pierced Dhrishtadyumna also, uttered a loud roar. Nakula pierced him in return with twelve shafts, the descendant of Madhu's race with three, Sahadeva with seventy, Partha with nine, Dhrishtadyumna with seventy and Bhimasena with seven shafts.</p>

<p id='7'>तथैवान्ये महीपाला नानादेशसमागताः। पाण्डवानभ्यवर्तन्त विविधायुधपाणयः॥<br />So also many other kings, come from various other realms, rushed at the Pandavas, bearing in their hands weapons of diverse kinds.</p>
<p id='8'>तथैव पाण्डवा राजन् परिवब्रुः पितामहम्। स समन्तात् परिवृतो रथौधैरपराजितः॥<br />The Pandavas also surrounded the grandsire on all sides. That invincible one (Bhishma) surrounded by that mighty division of cars,</p>
<p id='9'>गहनेऽग्निरिवोत्सृष्टः प्रजज्वाल दहन् परान्। रथाग्न्यगारश्चापार्चिरसिशक्तिगदेन्धनः॥<br />Blazed forth destroying the foe, like a terrible conflagration in a wood. His car was his fire chamber, his bow was his flames, his sword, dares, and maces were his fuels.</p>
<p id='10'>शरस्फुलिङ्गो भीष्माग्निर्ददाह क्षत्रियर्षभान्। सुवर्णपुङरिषुभिर्गार्धपक्षौः सुतेजनैः॥<br />His arrows were the scintillation's, and Bhishma himself was the fire that consumed the forest of the Kshatriyas. With arrows furnished with golden wings and the feathers of vultures and charged with great energy,</p>
<p id='11'>कर्णिनालीकनाराचैश्छादयामास तद् बलम्। अपातयद् ध्वजांश्चैव रथिनश्च शितैः शरैः॥<br />With barbed arrows, with Nalikas and Narachas, Bhishma covered that army of the Pandavas. He felled with whetted shafts elephants and car-warriors.</p>
<p id='12'>मुण्डतालवनानीव चकार स रथव्रजान्। निर्मनुष्यान् रथान् राजन् गजाश्वांश्च संयुगे॥ अकरोत् स महाबाहुः सर्वशस्त्रभृतां वरः। तस्य ज्यातलनिर्घोषं विस्फूर्जितमिवाशनेः॥ निशम्य सर्वभूतानि समकम्पन्त भारत। अमोघा ह्यपतन् बाणाः पितुस्ते भरतर्षभ॥<br />He made the large detachment of carwarriors look like a palmyra-forest with its trees deprived of their tops. In that battle, ) king, that mighty-armed hero, the foremost of all wielders of weapons, made cars, elephants and steeds deprived of their riders. Hearing the twang, that resembled the rumbling of the thunder, of your father's bow, ( Bharata, ali creatures began to tremble, and O foremost of the Bharatas, then the arrows of your father seemed to be incapable of being baffled.</p>
<p id='13'>नासज्जन्त तनुत्रेषु भीष्मचापच्युताः शराः। हतवीरान् रथान् राजन् संयुक्ताञ्जवनैर्हयैः॥ अपश्याम महाराज ह्रियमाणान् रणाजिरे। चेदिकाशिकरूषाणं सहस्राणि चतुर्दश॥ महारथाः समाख्याताः कुलपुत्रास्तनुत्यजः। अपरावर्तिनः सर्वे सुवर्णविकृतध्वजाः॥ संग्रामे भीष्ममासाद्य व्यादितास्यमिवान्तकम्। निमग्नाः परलोकाय सवाजिरथकुञ्जराः॥<br />Then the arrows, shot from the bow of Bhishma, did not only strike against the armours of combatants but penetrated through them. We saw, O monarch, many cars dragged over the field, by the fleet steeds that were harnessed to them, in consequence of the death of the heroes that rode them. Four and ten thousand car-warriors belonging to the Chedis, the Kashis and the Karushas, all well-known, and born of illustrious family, never retreating from field and owners of golden standards, prepared to lay down their lives in battle, encountering Bhishma who looked like Death himself with mouth wide open, were all dispatched to the regions of the departed along with their steeds, cars and elephants.</p>
<p id='14'>भग्नाक्षोपस्करान् कांश्चिद् भग्नचक्रांश्च भारत। अपश्याम महाराज शतशोऽथ सहस्रशः॥<br />We beheld, O monarch, chariots by hundreds and thousands then, some with their Akihas shattered and bottoms broken, some with their wheels broken.</p>

<p id='19'>न्यपतन्त मतप्राणाः शतशोऽथ सहस्रशः। यतमानाश्च ते वीरा द्रवमाणान् महारथान्॥ नाशक्नुवन् वारयितुं भीष्मबाणप्रपीडितान्। महेन्द्रसमवीर्येण वध्यमाना महाचमूः॥ अभज्यत महाराज न च द्वौ सह धावतः। आविद्धरथनागाश्वं पतितध्वजसंकुलम्॥<br />Began to fall down dead on the field by hundreds and by thousands. Striving their least, the heroic warriors of the Pandava army could not rally the car-warriors who, afflicted by the arrows of Bhishma, were flying then in all directions. That mighty host (of the Pandavas), slaughtered by Bhishma who equaled even Indra in prowess, were so completely broken that no two persons were seen to fly together. With its chariots, elephants and horses laid low and with its standards and flags overthrown in profusion,</p>
<p id='20'>अनीकं पाण्डुपुत्राणां हाहाभूतमचेतनम्। जघानात्र पिता पुत्रं पुत्रश्च पितरं तथा।॥ प्रियं सखायं चाक्रन्दे सखा दैवबलात् कृतः। विमुच्य कवचानन्ये पाण्डुपुत्रस्य सैनिकाः॥ प्रकीर्य कैशान् धावन्तः प्रत्यदृश्यन्त सर्वशः। तद् गोकुलमिवोद्भ्रान्तमुद्घान्तरथकूबरम्॥ ददृशे पाण्डुपुत्रस्य सैन्यमार्तस्वरं तदा। प्रभज्यमानं सैन्यं तु दृष्ट्वा यादवनन्दनः॥<br />The army of the sons of Pandu, deprived of its consciousness began to utter cries of “Oh” and "Alas.” In that battle father slew his own son and son slew his own father, and friend slew his dear friend urged on to the deed by Destiny. Many combatants of the Pandava army, doffing their armours, were seen to run away in all directions with their hair disheveled. Then the troops belonging to the son of Pandu were seen to run hurriedly in fear like a herd of bulls throwing aside the yokes of cars, and the cries of distress that these troops then uttered were indeed fearful. Then the descendant of the Yadava race beholding the army thus routed,</p>
<p id='21'>उवाच पार्थं बीभत्सुं निगृह्य रथमुत्तमम्। अयं स कालः सम्प्राप्तः पार्थ यः काक्षितस्तव॥<br />Spoke to Vibhatsu the son of Pritha reining in the excellent chariot he drove, "O Partha, the hour which you so ardently looked forward to, has now arrived.</p>

<p id='23'>विराटनगरे तात संजयस्य समीपतः। भीष्मद्रोणमुखान् सर्वान् धार्तराष्ट्रस्य सैनिकान्॥ सानुबन्धान् हनिष्यामि ये मां योत्स्यन्ति संगरे। इति तत् कुरु कौन्तेय सत्यं वाक्यमरिंदम॥<br />In the city of Virata, before Sanjaya himself. O Pritha's son, those words are 'I will slay all the combatants of Dhritarashtra's son along with their followers, headed by Bhishma and Drona, all who will fight with me.' O son of Kunti, O grinder of foes, do you now verify those words of yours.</p>
<p id='24'>क्षत्रधर्ममनुस्मृत्य युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः। इत्युक्तो वासुदेवेन तिर्यग्दृष्टिरधोमुखः॥ अकाम इव बीभत्सुरिदं वचनमब्रवीत्। अवध्यानां वधं कृत्वा राज्यं वा नरकोत्तरम्॥<br />Remembering the duties of a Kshatriya go to fighting without harbouring any anxious feeling.” Thus spoken to, by the son of Vasudeva, with his head hung down and loO king askance, Arjuna as if unwilling said these words to the former. “Either to acquire monarchy with hell at the end by the slighter of those who ought not to be slain,</p>
<p id='25'>दुःखानि वनवासे वा किं नु मे सुकृतं भवेत्। चोदयाश्वान् यतो भीष्मः करिष्ये वचनं तव॥<br />Or to suffer the woes of an exiled life, which of these should now be considered as my duty? However, O Hrishikesha, urged the steeds on, I shall do your bidding.</p>
<p id='26'>पातयिष्यामि दुर्धर्षं भीष्मं कुरुपितामहम्। स चाश्वान् रजतप्रख्यांश्चोदयामास माधवः॥<br />I will lay low Bhishma the grandsire of the Kurus." Thereupon that descendant of Madhu's race, drove those steeds of Argentine hue,</p>
<p id='27'>यतो भीष्मस्ततो राजन् दुष्प्रेक्ष्यो रश्मिवानिव।<br />To the spot, O king, where Bhishma; incapable of being gazed at like the sun himself, was staying. Thereupon the mighty army of king Yudhishthira returned to the charge,</p>
<p id='28'>दृष्ट्वा पार्थं महाबाहुं भीष्मायोद्यतमाहवे। ततो भीष्मः कुरुश्रेष्ठः सिंहवद् विनदन् मुहुः॥<br />Beholding the mighty-armed son of Pritha rush for an encounter with Bhishma in that terrible fight. Thereupon, O foremost of the Kurus, Bhishma uttered his war-cry even like a roaring lion,</p>
<p id='29'>धनंजयरथं शीघ्रं शरवर्षैरवाकिरत्। क्षणेन स रथस्तस्य सहयः सहसारथिः॥<br />And then quickly covered the car of Dhananjaya with a shower of arrows. Within a moment Arjuna's car with the steeds and charioteer,</p>
<p id='30'>शरवर्षेण महता न प्राज्ञायत भारत। वासुदेवस्त्वसम्भ्रान्तो धैर्यमास्थाय सत्वरः॥<br />Were lost to view in consequence of that thick arrows shower. But the son of Vasudeva, with the least delay and with patience, fearlessly,</p>
<p id='31'>चोदयामास तानश्वान् विनुन्नान् भीष्मसायकैः। ततः पार्थो धनुर्गृह्य दिव्यं जलदनिःस्वनम्॥<br />Drove forward those steeds mangled with the shafts of Bhishma. Then the son of Pritha taking up his bow of celestial make and of twang as loud as the rumble of clouds,</p>
<p id='32'>पातयामास भीष्मस्य धनुश्छित्त्वा शितैः शरैः। सच्छिन्नधन्वा कौरव्यः पुनरन्यन्महद् धनुः॥ निमेषान्तरमात्रेण सज्यं चक्रे पिता तव। चकर्ष च ततो दो• धनुर्जलदनिःस्वनम्॥ अथास्य तदपि क्रुद्धश्चिच्छेद धनुरर्जुनः।<br />Felled the bow of Bhishma having burst it open with whetted shafts. Then deprived of his bow, that foremost of the Kurus, viz., your father, within a moment made another bow ready for use. But Arjuna, waxing worth, cut off even that bow of his.</p>
<p id='33'>तस्य तत् पूजयामास लाघवं शान्तनोः सुतः॥ गाङ्गेयस्त्वब्रवीत् पार्थं धन्विश्रेष्ठमरिंदम। साधु साधु महाबाहो साधु कुन्तीसुतेति च॥<br />Then the son of Shantanu highly praised Arjuna's lightness of hand saying "Well-done well-done, O mighty-armed one, well-done, 0 son of Kunti."</p>
<p id='34'>समाभाष्यैवमपरं प्रगृह्य रुचिरं धनुः। मुमोच समरे भीष्मः शरान् पार्थरथं प्रति॥<br />Having thus applauded Partha and taking up another bow of great excellence, Bhishma sped, in that battle, arrows against the chariot of the former.</p>
<p id='35'>अदर्शयद् वासुदेवो हययाने परं बलम्। मोघान् कुर्वशरांस्तस्य मण्डलानि निदर्शयन्॥<br />Then the son of Vasudeva displayed superior skill in the management of horses in as much as he baffled Bhishma's arrows by a swift whirling of the car in a circular motion.</p>
<p id='36'>शुशुभाते नरव्याघ्रौ तौ भीष्मशरविक्षतौ। गोवृषाविव संरब्धौ विषाणोल्लिखिताङ्कितौ॥<br />Mangled with the shafts of Bhishma, those two foremost of men, (Arjuna and Krishna) then appeared beautiful like two heifers, enraged, and mangled with scratches of their horns.</p>
<p id='37'>वासुदेवस्तु सम्प्रेक्ष्य पार्थस्य मृदुयुद्धताम्। भीष्मं च शरवर्षाणि सृजनामनिशं युधि॥ प्रतपन्तमिवादित्यं मध्यमासाद्य सेनयोः। वरान् वरान् विनिघ्नन्तं पाण्डुपुत्रस्य सैनिकान्॥ युगान्तमिव कुर्वाणं भीष्मं यौधिष्ठिरे बले। नामृष्यत महाबाहुर्माधवः परवीरहा॥<br />Then that slayer of hostile heroes, that mighty-armed descendant of Madhu's race, viz., the son of Vasudeva, seeing that Arjuna was fighting mildly, and that Bhishma was continually pouring his showers of arrows in battle, also that the latter standing in the centre of the two hosts, was scorching (every thing) like the sun himself and was slaying the foremost combatants of the army of Pandu's son, and was producing in the army of Yudhishthira a total annihilation like that at the end of a Yuga, was unable to bear it any longer.</p>
<p id='38'>उत्सृज्य रजतप्रख्यान् हयान् पार्थस्य मारिष। वासुदेवस्ततो योगी प्रचस्कन्द महारथात्॥<br />Then, O sire, throwing away the reins of Partha's steeds of Argentine hue, that illustrious Yogin (Krishna) waxing irascible, jumped down from that huge chariot.</p>
<p id='39'>अभिदुद्राव भीष्मं स भुजप्रहरणो बली। प्रतोदपाणिस्तेजस्वी सिंहवद् विनदन् मुहुः॥ दारयन्निव पद्भ्यां स जगतीं जगदीश्वरः। क्रोधताप्रेक्षणः कृष्णो जिघांसुरमितद्युतिः॥<br />Then roaring repeatedly like a lion, Krishna endued with strength and fleetness, and of incomparable effulgence, that lord of the universe, having his bare arms for his weapons and wielding the whip in his hands, and with his eyes coppery in rage, rushed towards Bhishma, splitting the earth with his tread, and desirous of slaying the latter.</p>
<p id='40'>ग्रसन्तमिव चेतांसि तावकानां महाहवे। दृष्ट्वा माधवमाक्रन्दे भीष्मायोद्यतमन्तिके॥<br />In that mighty battle, the hearts of your warriors were filled with terror as they beheld him of Madhu's race near Bhishma, ready to fall upon the latter.</p>
<p id='41'>हतो भीष्मो हतो भीष्मस्तत्र तत्र वचो महत्। अश्रूयत महाराज वासुदेवभयात् तदा॥<br />Then, O mighty monarch, exclamations of 'Bhishma is slain, Bhishma is slain' were heard there, uttered by your troops inspired with the fear of Vasudeva's son.</p>
<p id='42'>पीतकौशेयसंवीतो मणिश्यामो जनार्दनः। शुशुभे विद्रवन् भीष्मं विद्युन्माली यथाम्बुदः॥<br />Then Janardana, vested in yellow silk raiment’s and blue in complexion like the lapis lazuli, rushing towards Bhishma appeared beautiful like a rain cloud charged with lightning.</p>
<p id='43'>स सिंह इव मातङ्गं यूथर्षभ इवर्षभम्। अभिदुद्राव वेगेन विनदन् यादवर्षभः॥<br />Just as the king of beasts uttering loud roars rushes towards the leader of an elephant-herd, so then that foremost of Madhu's race rushed impetuously towards Bhishma, uttering loud roars.</p>
<p id='44'>तमापतन्तं सम्प्रेक्ष्य पुण्डरीकाक्षमाहवे। असम्भ्रमं रणे भीष्मो विचकर्ष महद् धनुः॥<br />Then beholding in that dreadful battle, Krishna of eyes like lotus petals rush furiously towards him, Bhishma began to stretch his strong and mighty bow.</p>
<p id='45'>उवाच चैव गोविन्दमसम्भ्रान्तेन चेतसा। एह्येहि पुण्डरीकाक्ष देवदेव नमोऽस्तु ते॥<br />Then addressing Govinda with a dauntless heart, he said "Come, come, O you of eyes like lotus petals! O god of gods, I do bow down unto you.</p>
<p id='46'>मामद्य सात्वतश्रेष्ठ पातयस्व महाहवे। त्वया हि देव संग्रामे हतस्यापि ममानघ॥<br />Lay me low, O foremost of the Satvata race, this day in this dreadful fight! O sinless one, slain by you in this battle, O god,</p>
<p id='47'>श्रेय एव परं कृष्ण लोके भवति सर्वतः। सम्भावितोऽस्मि गोविन्द त्रैलोक्येनाद्य संयुगे॥<br />I shall reap great good, O Krishna, in every respect in this world. O Govinda, today, in the three worlds, have I attained great honour in battle.</p>
<p id='48'>प्रहरस्व यथेष्टं वै दासौऽस्मि तव चानघ। पार्थः समभिद्रुत्य केशवम्॥ नग्राह महाबाहुर्बाहुभ्यां परिगृह्य वै। निगृह्यमाणः पार्थेन कृष्णो राजीवलोचनः॥ जगामैवैनमादाय वेगेन पुरुषोत्तमः। पार्थस्तु विष्टभ्य बलाच्चरणौ परवीरहा॥ अन्वगेव ततः निजग्राह हृषीकेशं कथंचिदं दशमे पदे।<br />Strike me as it pleases you, O sinless one, as I am merely a slave of yours.” Meanwhile the mighty-armed son of Pritha, running behind Keshava, seized the latter embracing him with his two arms. That foremost of men viz., Krishna of eyes like expanded lotuses, thus held by the son of Pritha proceeded even carrying the latter with him. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, that puissant warrior, the son of Pritha, forcibly encircling (with his two arms) the two legs of Hrishikesha stopped him when he was going to take the tenth step.</p>
<p id='49'>तत एवमुवाचार्तः क्रोधपर्याकुलेक्षणम्॥ निःश्वसन्तं यथा नागमर्जुनः प्रणयात् सखा। निवर्तस्व महाबाहो नानृतं कर्तुमर्हसि॥ यत् त्वया कथितं पूर्वं न योत्स्यामिति केशव। मिथ्यावादीति लोकास्त्वां कथयिष्यन्ति माधव॥<br />Then his friend Arjuna, highly distressed, affectionately addressing Keshava, who was then breathing like a snake and whose eyes were rolling in wrath, said 'Stop, O mightyarmed one! It behooves you not to falsify those words of yours viz., 'I will not fight,' that you had spoken before, O Keshava. Then, O descendant of Madhu's race, men will call your a liar.</p>
<p id='50'>ममैषः भारः सर्वो हि हनिष्यामि पितामहम्। शपे केशव शस्त्रेण सत्येन सुकृतेन च॥<br />Let all the burden be on me, I will slay the grandsire! Ishvara, O Keshava, o Keshava, by my weapons, by my troth and by iny good achievements,</p>
<p id='51'>अन्तं यथा गमिष्यामि शत्रूणां शत्रुसूदन। अद्यैव पश्य दुर्धर्षं पात्यमानं महास्थम्॥<br />That, O destroyer of foes, I will do everything by which the destruction of the enemy may be accomplished. Even this day behold the invincible mighty car-warrior overthrown.</p>
<p id='52'>तारापतिमिवापूर्णमन्तकाले यदृच्छया। माधवस्तु वचः श्रुत्वा फाल्गुनस्य महात्मनः॥ (अभवत् परमप्रीतो ज्ञात्वा पार्थस्य विक्रमम्।)<br />By me, with the least difficulty like the crescent moon at the end of a Yuga.” Hearing those words of the high-souled Phalguna, that descendant of Madhu's race, became cheerful knowing the prowess of Partha.</p>
<p id='53'>न किंचिदुक्त्वा सक्रोध आरुरोह रथं पुनः। तौ रथस्थौ नरव्याघ्रो भीष्मः शान्तनवः पुनः॥ ववर्ष शरवर्षेण मेघो वृष्ट्या यथाऽचलौ। प्राणानादत्त योधानां पिता देवव्रतस्तव॥<br />Without speaking any thing, again mounted the chariot in rage. Then Bhishma the son of Shantanu, once more covered those two foremost of men on their cars, with an arrows downpour, like clouds drenching the mountain breast with showers of rain. Then your sire Devavrata took the lives of all hostile warriors,</p>
<p id='54'>गभस्तिभिरिवादित्यस्तेजांसि शिशिरात्यये। यथा कूरूणां सैन्यानि बभ युधि पाण्डवाः॥<br />Like the sun drawing energies from all things with his rays at the end of the winter season. As the sons of Pandu broke the ranks of the Kuru troops in battle.</p>
<p id='55'>तथा पाण्डवसैन्यानि बभञ्ज युधि ते पिता। हतविद्रुतसैन्यास्तु निरुत्साहा विचेतसः॥ निरीक्षितुं न शेकुस्ते भीष्ममप्रतिमं रणे। मध्यंगतमिवादित्यं प्रतपन्तं स्वतेजसा॥ ते वध्यमाना भीष्मेण शतशोऽथ सहस्रशः। कुर्वाणं समरे कर्माण्यतिमानुषविक्रमम्॥ वीक्षांचक्रुर्महाराज पाण्डवा भयपीडिताः। तथा पाण्डवसैन्यानि द्राव्यमाणानि भारत॥ त्रातारं नाध्यगच्छन्त गावः पङ्कगता इव। पिपीलिका इव क्षुण्णा दुर्बला बलिना रणे॥<br />So your father also broke the Pandava ranks in battle. The soldiers thus routed, and despondent and cheerless, slain, by hundreds and thousands, by Bhishma, were unable to gaze at the incomparable Bhishma, who was scorching the foe like the sun in the meridian. The Pandava troops then afflicted with terror, O monarch, (fearfully) looked at Bhishma who was achieving great feats with his superhuman prowess. Then, O Bharata, the Pandava troops thus crushed by Bhishma, could not find a protector, like kine sunk in slough, or like an ephemeral ant afflicted by a powerful creature.</p>
<p id='56'>महारथं भारत दुष्प्रकम्पं शरौघिणं प्रतपन्तं नरेन्द्रान्। भीष्मं न शेकुः प्रतिभीक्षितुं ते शरार्चिषं सूर्यमिवातपन्तम्॥<br />The combatants of the Pandava hosts, O Bharata, were unable to look at that mighty car-warrior Bhishma, who was incapable of being shaken, who with his arrow showers was afflicting the hostile kings, and who in consequence of his blazing shafts looked like the shining sun.</p>
<p id='57'>मस्तं जगामाथ सहस्ररश्मिः। ततो बलानां श्रमकर्शितानां मनोऽवहारं प्रति सम्बभूव॥<br />While he was thus crushing the Pandava troops, the sun of thousand rays went below the horizon. Then the hearts, of all those warriors exhausted with fatigue, yearned for the order of withdrawal.</p>
