<h3>None: Chapter 11</h3><h4>Dhritarashtra distributes money</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच ततो रजन्यां व्युष्टायां धृतराष्ट्रोऽम्बिकासुतः। विदुरं प्रेषयामास युधिष्ठिर निवेशनम्॥<br />Vaishampayana said After that night had passed away, Dhritarashtra, the son of Ambika, sent Vidura to Yudhishthira's place.</p>
<p id='2'>स गत्वा राजवचनादुवाचाच्युतमीश्वरम्। युधिष्ठिरं महातेजाः सर्वबुद्धिमतां वरः॥ धृतराष्ट्रो महाराजो वनवासाय दीक्षितः। गमिष्यति वनं राजन्नागतां कार्तिकीमिमाम्॥<br />Gifted with great energy and the foremost of all persons endued with intelligence, Vidura. having arrived at at Yudhishthira's palace, addressed that foremost of men, that king of undecaying glory, in these words:—King Diritarashtra has perforined the preliminary rites for accomplishing his purpose of retiring into the forest. He will start for the woods, O king, on the coming day of full moon of the month of Kartika.</p>
<p id='3'>स त्वां कुरुकुलश्रेष्ठ किंचिदर्थमभीप्सति। श्राद्धमिच्छति दातुं स गाङ्गेयस्य महात्मनः॥ द्रोणस्य सोमदत्तस्य बालीकस्य च धीमतः। पुत्राणां चैव सर्वेषां ये चान्ये सुहृदो हताः॥ यदि चाप्यनुजानीषे सैन्धवापसदस्य च।<br />He now solicits from you, O foremost of Kuru's race, some money. He wishes to perform the Shraddha of the great son of Ganga, as also of Drona and Somadatta and Vallika of great intelligence, and of all his sons as also of all other wishers of his who have been killed, and, if you permit it, of that wicked king of the Sindhus.</p>
<p id='4'>नरर्षभम्। एतच्छुत्वा तु वचनं विदुरस्य युधिष्ठिरः॥ हृष्टः सम्पूजयामास गुडाकेशश्च पाण्डवः।<br />Hearing these words of Vidura, both Yudhishthira, and Pandus' son Arjuna of curly hair, became very glad and applauded them highly.</p>
<p id='5'>न च भीमो दृढक्रोधस्तद्वचो जगृहे तदा॥ विदुरस्य महातेजा दुर्योधनकृतं स्मरन्। अभिप्रायं विदित्वा तु भीमसेनस्य फाल्गुनः॥ किरीटी किंचिदानम्य तमुवाच भीम राजा पिता वृद्धो वनवासाय दीक्षितः॥<br />Bhima, however, of great energy and an unappeasable anger, did not accept those words of Vidura in good spirits, recollecting the acts of Duryodhana. Understanding the thoughts of Bhimasena, the diadem-decked Phalguna, slightly bending bending his face downwards, addressed that foremost of men in these words: 'O Bhima, our royal lather who is old, has resolved to retire into the forest.</p>
<p id='6'>दातुमिच्छति सर्वेषां सुहृदामौर्ध्वदेहिकम्। भवता निर्जितं वित्तं दातुमिच्छति कौरवः॥<br />He wishes to make gifts for advancing the happiness of his killed kinsmen and wellwishers now in the other world. O you of Kuru's race, he wishes to give away wealth that belongs to you by conquest.</p>
<p id='7'>भीष्मादीनां महाबाहो तदनुज्ञातुमर्हसि। दिष्ट्या त्वद्य महाबाहो धृतराष्ट्रः प्रयाचते॥ याचितो यः पुरास्माभिः पश्य कालस्य पर्ययम्। योऽसौ पृथिव्याः कृत्स्नाया भर्ता भूत्वा नराधिपः॥१२ परैर्विनिहतामात्यो वनं गन्तुमभीप्सति। मा तेऽन्यत् पुरुषव्याघ्र दानाद् भवतु दर्शनम्॥<br />Indeed, O mighty-armed one, it is for Bhishma and others that the old king is desirous of making those gifts. You should grant your permission. By good luck it is, O you of mighty arms, that Dhritarashtra today begs wealth of us, he who was formerly begged by us. Mark the reverses brought about by time. That king who was before the lord and protector of the whole Earth, now wishes to go into the forest, his kinsmen and associates all killed by enemies. O king, let not your views deviate from granting the permission asked.</p>
<p id='8'>अयशस्यमतोऽन्यत् स्यादधर्मश्च महाभुज। राजानमुपशिक्षस्व ज्येष्ठं भ्रातरमीश्वरम्॥<br />O mighty-armed one, refusal, besides bringing infamy, will yield demerit. Do you learn your duty in this matter from the king, your eldest brother, who is lord of all.</p>
<p id='9'>अर्हस्त्वमपि दातुं वै नादातुं भरतर्षभ। एवं ब्रुवाणं वीभत्सुं धर्मराजोऽप्यपूजयत्॥<br />You should give instead of refusing, O chief of Bharata's race!' Bibhatsu who was saying so was applauded by king Yudhishthira the just.</p>
<p id='10'>भीमसेनस्तु सक्रोधः प्रोवाचेदं वचस्तदा। वयं भीष्मस्य दास्यामः प्रेतकार्यं तु फाल्गुन॥ सोमदत्तस्य नृपते रिश्रवस एव च। बाह्रीकस्य च राजर्षेनॊणस्य च महात्मनः॥ अन्येषां चैव सर्वेषां कुन्ती कर्णाय दास्यति। श्राद्धानि पुरुषव्याघ्र मा प्रादात् कौरवो नृपः॥<br />Yielding to anger Bhimasena said these words :-O Phalguna, it is we that shall make gifts in the matter of Bhishma's obsequies, as also of king Somavatta and of Bhurishravas, of the royal sage Valhika, and of the great Drona, and of all others. Our mother Kunti shall make such obsequial offerings for Karna. O foremost of men, let not Dhritarashtra perform those Sharaddhas.</p>
<p id='11'>इति मे वर्तते बुद्धिर्मा नो निन्दन्तु शत्रवः। कष्टात्कष्टतरं यान्तु सर्वे दुर्योधनादयः॥<br />This is what I think. Let not our enemies be gladdened. Let Duryodhana and others sink from a miserable to a more miserable position.</p>
<p id='12'>यैरियं पृथिवी कृत्स्ना घातिता कुलपांसनैः। कुतस्त्वमसि विस्मृत्य वैरं द्वादशवार्षिकम्॥ अज्ञातवासं गहनं द्रौपदीशोकवर्धनम्। क्व तदा धृतराष्ट्रस्य स्नेहोऽस्मन्द्रोचरो गतः॥ सार्धं पाञ्चालपुत्र्या<br />Alas, it was those wretches of their family who caused the whole Earth to be exterininated? How have you been able to forget that anxiety of twelve long years and out living in deep forest in cognite that was so painful to Draupadi? Where was Dhritarashtra's affection for us then?</p>
<p id='13'>कृष्णाजिनोपसंवीतो हृताभरणभूषणः। त्वं राजानमुपजग्मिवान्।॥<br />Clad in a black deer-skin and divested of all your ornaments, with the Princess of Panchala in your company, did you not follow this king?</p>
<p id='14'>क्व तदा द्रोणभीष्मौ तौ सोमदत्तोऽपि वाऽभवत्। यत्र त्रयोदशसमा वने वन्येन जीवथ॥<br />Where were Bhishma and Drona then, and where was Somadatta? You had to live for thirteen years in the forest depending on the products of the wilderness.</p>
<p id='15'>न तदां त्वां पिता ज्येष्ठः पितृत्वेनाभिवीक्षते। किं ते तद् विस्मृतं पार्थ यदेष कुलपांसनः॥ दुर्बुद्धिर्विदुरं प्राह द्यूते किं जितमित्युत। तमेवं वादिनं राजा कुन्तीपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरः। उवाच वचनं धीमान् जोषमास्वेति भर्त्सयन्॥<br />Your eldest father did not then look at you with eyes of parental affection. Have you forgotten, O Partha, that it was this wretch of our family, of wicked understanding, who enquired of Vidura, when the match at dice was going on, 'What has been won?' Hearing thus far, king Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, gifted with great intelligence, rebuked him and told him to be silent.</p>
