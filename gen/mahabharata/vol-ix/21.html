<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 21</h3><h4>The declaration about joint duties on the occasion of a person's marriage. The discourse between Ashtavakra and Disha</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच न बिभेति कथं सा स्त्री शापाच्च परमद्युतेः। कथं निवृत्तो भगवांस्तद् भवान् प्रब्रवीतु मे॥<br />Yudhishthira said Tell me why had that lady no fear of Ashtavakra's curse although Ashtavakra was gified with great energy? How also did Ashtavakra succeed in returning from that palace?</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच अष्टावक्रोऽन्वपृच्छत् तां रूपं विकुरुषे कथम्। न चानृतं ते वक्तव्यं ब्रूहि ब्राह्मणकाम्यया।॥<br />Bhishma said Ashtavakra asked her, saying How do you change your form so? You should not say anything false. I wish to know this. Do you speak truly before a Brahmana.</p>
<p id='3'>स्व्युरुवाच द्यावापृथिव्योर्यत्रैषा काम्या ब्राह्मणसत्तम। शृणुष्वावहितः सर्वे यदिदं सत्यविक्रम॥<br />The lady said O best of Brahmanas, wherever you may live, in the celestial region or on Earth. This desire of union between the sexes is to be observed. O you of infallible prowess, hear with rapt attention, what it all is.</p>
<p id='4'>जिज्ञासेयं प्रयुक्ता मे स्थिरीकर्तुं तवानघ। अव्युत्थानेन ते लोका जिताः सत्यपराक्रम॥<br />This trial was converted by me, O sinless one, for examining you aright, O you of infallible prowess, you have conquered all the worlds by the strength of mind.</p>
<p id='5'>उत्तरां मां दिशं विद्धि दृष्टं स्त्रीचापलं च ते। स्थविराणामपि स्त्रीणां बाधते मैथुनज्वरः॥<br />Know me as the embodiment of the Northern point of the compass. You have seen the lightness of the female character. Even old women are tortured by the desires of sexual union.</p>
<p id='6'>तुष्टः पितामहस्तेऽद्य तथा देवाः सवासवाः। स त्वं येन च कार्येण सम्प्राप्तो भगवानिह॥<br />The grandfather himself and all the gods with Indra have been pleased with you. I know the object for which your illustrious self has come here.</p>
<p id='7'>प्रेषितस्तेन विप्रेण कन्यापित्रा द्विजर्षभ। तवोपदेशं कर्तुं वै तच्च सर्वे कृतं मया॥<br />O foremost of twice born persons, you have been sent here by the Rishi Vadanya the father of your bride in order that I may instruct you. According to the wishes of that Rishi I have already instructed you.</p>
<p id='8'>क्षेमैर्गमिष्यसि गृहं श्रमश्च न भविष्यति। कन्यां प्राप्स्यसि तां विप्र पुत्रिणी च भविष्यति॥<br />You will return home safely. Your journey back will not be toilsome. You will get for wife the girl you have chosen. She will bear you a son.</p>
<p id='9'>काम्यया पृष्टवांस्त्वं मां ततो व्याहृतमुत्तमम्। अनतिक्रमणीया सा कृत्स्नैर्लोकैस्त्रिभिः सदा॥<br />Through desire I had solicited you. You gave me the very best answer. People of the three worlds cannot get over the desire for sexual union.</p>
<p id='10'>गच्छस्व सुकृतं कृत्सा किं चान्यच्छ्रोतुमिच्छसि। यावद् ब्रवीमि विप्रर्षे अष्टावक्र यथातथम्॥<br />Return to your quarters, having achieved such merit. What else is there which yo!' wish to hear (from me)? I shall truly describe it to you, O Ashtavakra.</p>
<p id='11'>ऋषिणा प्रसादिता चास्मि तव हेतोर्द्विजर्षभ। तस्य सम्माननार्थे मे त्वयि वाक्यं प्रभाषितम्॥<br />I was gratified by the Rishi Vadanya in the first instance for your sake, Otwice born ascetic! For the sake of honouring him, I have said all this to you.</p>
<p id='12'>भीष्म उवाच श्रुत्वा तु वचनं तस्याः स विप्रः प्राञ्जलिः स्थितः। अनुज्ञातस्तया चापि स्वगृहं पुनराव्रजत्॥<br />Bhishma said Hearing these words of hers, the twiceborn Ashtavakra joined his hands respectfully. He then begged the lady for her permission to return. Getting the permission he sought, he returned to his own hermitage.</p>
<p id='13'>गृहमागत्य विश्रान्तः स्वजनं परिपृच्छय च। अभ्यगच्छच्च तं विप्रं न्यायत: कुरुनन्दन॥<br />Resting himself for sometime at home and getting the permission of his kinsmen and friends, he then, in a proper way, went, O delighter of the Kurus, to the Brahmana Vadanya.</p>
<p id='14'>पृष्टश्च तेन विप्रेण दृष्टं त्वेतन्निदर्शनम्। प्राह विप्रं तदा विप्रः सुप्रीतेनान्तरात्मना॥<br />Welcomed with the usual enquiries by Vadanya the Rishi Ashtavakra, with a wellpleased heart described all that he had seen.</p>
<p id='15'>भवता समनुज्ञातः प्रास्थितो गन्धमादनम्। तस्य चोत्तरतो देशे दृष्टं मे दैवतं महत्॥<br />He said ordered by you I proceeded to the mountains of Gandhamadana. In the quarter lying to the north of those mountains I saw a very superior goddess,</p>
<p id='16'>तया चाहमनुज्ञातो भवांश्चापि प्रकीर्तितः। श्रावितश्चापि तद्वाक्यं गृहं चाभ्यागतः प्रभो॥<br />I was received by her with courtesy. She named you before me, and also instructed me in various matters. Having listened to her I have returned,Olord.</p>
<p id='17'>तमुवाच तदा विप्रः सुतां प्रतिगृहाण मे। नक्षत्रविधियोगेन पात्रं हि परमं भवान्॥<br />The learned Vadanya said to him take my daughter's hand according to due rites and under the proper constellations. You are the fittest bridegroom I can select for the girl.</p>
<p id='18'>भीष्म उवाच अष्टावक्रस्तथेत्युक्त्वा प्रतिगृह्य च तां प्रभो। कन्यां परमधर्मात्मा प्रीतिमांश्चाभवत् तदा॥<br />Bhishma said Ashtavakra said So be it! and espoused the girl. Indeed, having married the girl, the highly pious Rishi became filled with joy.</p>
<p id='19'>कन्यां तां प्रतिगृह्मैव भार्यां परमशोभनाम्। उवास मुदितस्तत्र स्वाश्रमे विगतज्वरः॥<br />Having taken as his wife that beautiful lady, the Rishi continued to live in his own hermitage freed from every sort of mental trouble.</p>
