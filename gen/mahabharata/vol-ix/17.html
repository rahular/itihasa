<p id='2'>उपमन्युरुवाच ब्रह्मप्रोक्तैर्ऋषिप्रोक्तैर्वेदवेदाङ्गसम्भवैः। सर्वलोकेषु विख्यातं स्तुत्यं स्तोष्यामि नामभिः॥<br />Upamanyu said I shall worship that great Deity who is worthy of the adorations of all creatures, by uttering those names which are celebrated over all the worlds,-names some of which were uttered by the Grandfather Brahman, some by the Rishis, and some of which occur in the Vedas, and the auxiliary sciences.</p>
<p id='3'>महद्भिर्विहितैः सत्यैः सिद्धैः सर्वार्थसाधकैः। ऋषिणा तण्डिना भक्त्या कृतैर्वेदकृतात्मना॥<br />Those names have been used by eminent persons. They are, again, true and fraught with success, and are capable of accomplishing all the objects of the utterer. They have been given to Mahadeva by Tandi whose soul was purified by Vedic learning and who invented those names with the help of his devotion.</p>
<p id='4'>यथोक्तैः साधुभिः ख्यातैर्मुनिभिस्तत्त्वदशिभिः। प्रवरं प्रथमं स्वर्ये सर्वभूतहितं शुभम्॥<br />With those names that have been uttered by many wellknown pious persons and by ascetics conversant with all the subjects I shall worship him who is the greatest, who is the first, who takes to heaven, who is ready to give benefits upon all creatures, and who is auspicious.</p>

<p id='7'>तेन ते श्रावयिष्यामि यत् तद् ब्रह्म सनातनम्। न शक्यं विस्तरात् कृत्स्नं वक्तुं सर्वस्य केनचित्॥ युक्तेनापि विभूतीनामपि वर्षशतैरपि। यस्यादिमध्यमन्तं च सुरैरपि च गम्यते॥<br />And because you are devoted to him, I shall, therefore, recite those names before you. Mahadeva is Eternal Brahma. No one even one cndued with Yoga is able to describe, in even a hundred years, the glory and power of that great Deity in full. The beginning, middle or end of Mahadeva cannot be apprehended by the very gods.</p>
<p id='8'>कस्तस्य शक्नुयाद् वक्तुं गुणान् कात्स्र्येन माधवा किं तु देवस्य महत: संक्षिप्तार्थपदाक्षरम्॥<br />Such being the fact, who is there O Mahadeva, that can recite the qualities of Mahadeva in full? I shall, however-through the favour of that illustrious supreme and perfectly wise Deity, extended to me for my devotion to him,-recite his attributes in an abstract of few words and letters.</p>
<p id='9'>शक्तितश्चरितं वक्ष्ये प्रसादात् तस्य धीमतः। अप्राप्य तु ततोऽनुज्ञां न शक्यः स्तोतुमीश्वरः॥<br />The Supreme Lord is incapable of being worshipped by any one if he does not grant his permission to the worshipper.

It destroys Rakshasas. It is a great purifier. It should be given only to him who his faith, to him who is devoted to the great Lord, to him who believes. It should never be communicated to him who has no faith, him who is an unbeliever, him who has not conquered his soul.</p>
<p id='16'>यश्चाभ्यसूयते देवं कारणात्मानमीश्वरम्। स कृष्ण नरकं याति सह पूर्वैः सहात्मजैः॥<br />That creature, O Krishna, who entertain malice towards the illustrious Mahadeva who is the original cause of everything, who is the Supreme Soul, and who is the great Lord, has surely to go to hell with all his ancestors before and all his children after him.</p>
