Indeed, it is these men who do not care for Homa, who never utter the Vashat and other sacred Mantras, and who come to be considered as the lowest and vilest of men.</p>
<p id='50'>एष देवि मया सर्वः संशयच्छेदनाय ते। कुशलाकुशलो नृणां व्याख्यातो धर्मसागरः॥<br />Thus, O goddess, have I explained to you the entire ocean of duties of human beings for the sake of removing your doubts, not omitting the sins of which they become guilty.</p>
