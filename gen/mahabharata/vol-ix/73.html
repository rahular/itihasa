<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>सन्ति नानाविधा लोका यांस्त्वं शक्र न पश्यसि। पश्यामियानहं लोकानेकपत्न्यश्च याः स्त्रियः॥<br />There are many kinds of regions, O Shakra, which are invisible to even you. Those regions are seen by me. O Indra,, as also by those women who are chaste and who have been devoted to only one husband.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>कर्मभिश्चापि सुशुभैः सुव्रता ऋषयस्तथा। सशरीरा हि तान् यान्ति ब्राह्मणाः शुभबुद्धयः॥<br />Rishis observe excellent vows, by means of their deeds of virtue and piety and Brahmanas of righteous souls, succeed in going there in even their human bodies.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>शरीरन्यासमोक्षेण मनसा निर्मलेन च। स्वप्नभूतांश्च ताल्लोकान् पश्यन्तीहापि सुव्रताः॥<br />Men who perform excellent vows see those regions which resemble the bright creations of dreams helped by their purified minds and by that (temporary) liberation which succeeds the loss of one's consciousness of body.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>ते तु लोकाः सहस्राक्ष शृणु यादृग्गुणान्विताः। न तत्र क्रमते कालो न जरा न च पावकः॥ तथा नास्त्यशुभं किंचिन्न व्याधिस्तत्र न क्रमः।<br />O you, of a thousand eyes, hear me as I tell you what the attributes are of those regions. There the very course of Time is stopped. Decrepitude is not there nor Fire which is omnipresent in the universe. There is slightest transgression does not take place, nor disease, nor weakness of any sort.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>यद् यच्च गावो मनसा तस्मिन् वान्छन्ति वासव॥ तत् सर्वं प्राप्नुवन्ति स्म मम प्रत्यक्षदर्शनात्।<br />The kine which live there, O Vasava, acquire the fruition of every desire which they cherish in their hearts. I have direct experience of what I say to you.</p>

Lakes, tanks, rivers, forests of diverse kinds, mansions, hills and all kinds of delightful objects are to be seen there. There is no region of happiness that is superior to any of these of which I speak.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>तत्र सर्वसहाः क्षान्ता वत्सला गुरुवर्तिनः। अहङ्कारैर्विरहिता यान्ति शक्र नरोत्तमाः॥<br />All those foremost of men, O Shakra, who are forgiving to all creatures, who endure everything, who are full of love for all things, who render dutiful obedience to their preceptors, and who are freed from pride and vanity, go to those regions of supreme happiness.</p>

Indeed, that wicked man who is sullied with such faults cannot even see these regions of happiness; nor he who injures his friends, nor he who is guileful; nor he who is ungrateful; nor he who is a cheat; nor he who is crooked in conduct; nor he who is a disregarder of religion nor he who is a slayer of Brahmanas. Such man cannot see in ever Imagination the region of kine that is the abode of only the pious.</p>

Hear now, O you of a hundred sacrifices, the merit of persons who are engaged in making gifts of kine.</p>

<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>न जातु ब्राह्मणो वाच्यो यदवाच्यं शचीपते। मनसा गोषु न दुह्येद् गोवृत्तिर्गोऽनुकल्पकः॥<br />Improper words, O lord of Shachi, should never be addressed to a Brahmana. One, again, should not, in even his mind, do an injury to a cow. One should in his conduct, imitate the cow, and show mercy towards the cow.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>सत्ये धर्मे च निरतस्तस्य शक्र फलं शृणु। गोसहस्रेण समिता तस्य धेनुर्भवत्युत॥<br />Hear, O Shakra, of the fruits which truthful persons enjoy. If such a person gives away a single cow, that becomes thousandfold.</p>

This is the issue of the scriptures.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>वैश्यस्यैते यदि गुणास्तस्य पञ्चशतं भवेत्। शूद्रस्यापि विनीतस्य चतुर्भागफलं स्मृतम्॥<br />If a Vaishya, endued with similar accomplishments, were to make a gift of a single cow, that cow would equal five hundred kine. If a Shudra endued with humility were to make a gift of a cow, such cow would be equal to a hundred and twenty five kine. one COW a a</p>

Hence, one, with singleness of devotion, observant of truth, and engaged in humbly serving his preceptor, should always make gifts of kine.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>वेदाध्यायी गोषु यो भक्तिमांश्च नित्यं दत्त्वा योऽभिनन्देत गाश्च। आजातितो यश्च गवां नमेत इदं फलं शक्र निबोध तस्य॥<br />Hear, O Shakra, what the merit is of that person who, duly studying the Vedas, shows respect for kine, who always becomes glad on seeing kine, and who since his birth always bows his head to kine.</p>

<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>यदेकभक्ततदश्नीयाद् दद्यादेकं गवां च यत्। दशवर्षाण्यनन्तानि गोव्रती गोऽनुकम्पकः॥<br />That man who takes only one meal a day and who gives away the entire quantity of his other meal to kine, that man, who thus respects kine with the steadiness of a vow and shows such mercy towards them, enjoys for ten years unlimited happiness.</p>

Listen now to the merits that Kshatriyas may acquire. It has been said that a Kshatriya, by purchasing a cow in this manner and making a gift of it to a Brahmana, acquires great happiness for five years. A Vaishya, by such conduct, wins only half the merit of a Kshatriyas, and a Shudra, by such conduct, wins half the merit that a Vaishya does.</p>

That man who having acquired kine by battle makes gifts of them, acquires as much merit as he who makes gifts of kine after having bought the same with the proceeds of selling oneself. That man who, in the absence of kine, makes a gift of a cow made of sesame seeds, controlling his senses the while, is saved by such a cow from every sort of calamity or distress. Such a man sports in great happiness.</p>

The considerations of worthy recipients, of time, of the kind of kine, and of the ritual to be observed, should be seen. One should determine the proper time for making a gift of kine. One should also determine the distinctive qualifications of both Brahmanas and of kine themselves. Kine should not be given to one in whose house they are likely to suffer from fire or the sun.</p>

Indeed, the gift should be made at a proper time and in a proper place.</p>

As Ganga is the foremost of all rivers, so is Kapila the foremost of all kine.</p>

Such kine, freed from every vice, should, at the same time, be accompained by healthy calves. Having made the gift, the giver should live for the next three days successively on food consisting only of the products of the cow.</p>
<p id='36'><a href='#36'></a>दत्त्वा धेनुं सुव्रतां साधुदोहां कल्याणवत्सामपलायिनीं च। स्तावन्ति वर्षाणि भवन्त्यमुत्र॥<br />By giving away a goodnatured cow, that quietly allows herself to be milked, that always brings forth living and healthy calves, and that does not fly away from the owner's house, the giver enjoys happiness in the next world for as many years as there are hairs on her body.</p>
<p id='37'><a href='#37'></a>तथानड्वाहं ब्राह्मणाय प्रदाय धुर्यं युवानं बलिनं विनीतम्। हलस्य वोढारमनन्तवीर्य प्राप्नोति लोकान् दशधेनुदस्य॥<br />Likewise, by giving to a Brahmana a bull that is capable of carrying heavy loads, that is young and strong and quiet, that quietly bears the yoke of the plough, and that is possessed of such energy as is sufficient to undergo even great labour, one acquires such regions as are his who gives away ten kine.</p>

<p id='39'><a href='#39'></a>अश्वमेधक्रतोस्तुल्यं फलं भवति शाश्वतम्। मृत्युकाले सहस्राक्ष यां वृत्तिमनुकाझते॥<br />The merit such a man wins is equal to the eternal merit of a Horsesacrifice. Such a person acquires whatever end he desires at the hour of death.</p>
<p id='40'><a href='#40'></a>लोकान् बहुविधान् दिव्यान् यच्चास्य हृदि वर्तते। तत् सर्वं समवाप्नोति कर्मणैतेन मानवः॥<br />For such an act a man acquires many a region of happiness, in fact, whatever happiness he seeks in his heart.</p>
<p id='41'><a href='#41'></a>गोभिश्च समनुज्ञात: सर्वत्र च महीयते। यस्त्वेतेनैव कल्पेन गां वनेष्वनुगच्छति॥ तृणगोमयपर्णाशी निःस्पृहो नियतः शुचिः। अकामं तेन वस्तव्यं मुदितेन शतक्रतो॥ मम लोके सुरैः सार्धे लोके यत्रापि चेच्छति॥<br />Indeed, such a man permitted by kine, lives honoured in every region of happiness. That man who follows kine every day in the forest with this intention, himself living the while on grass and cowdung and leaves of trees, his heart freed from desire of fruit, his senses controlled from every improper object, and his mind purified that man, O you of a hundred sacrifices, lives happily freed from the control of desire in my region or in any other region of happiness that he wishes, in the company of the celestials.</p>
