<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 138</h3><h4>The merits of gifts</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच श्रुतं मे भवतस्तात सत्यव्रतपराक्रमा दानधर्मेण महता ये प्राप्तास्त्रिदिवं नृपाः॥<br />Yudhishthira said I have heard from you. O sire, the names of those kings who have ascended to the celestial region. O you whose power is great in the observance of the vow of truth, by following the religion of gift.</p>
<p id='2'>इमांस्तु श्रोतुमिच्छामि धर्मान् धर्मभृतां वर। दानं कतिविधं देयं किं तस्य च फलं लभेत्॥<br />How many kinds of gifts are there? What are the fruits of the several kinds of gifts respectively.</p>
<p id='3'>कथं केभ्यश्च धर्म्य च दानं दातव्यमिष्यते। कैः कारणैः कतिविधं श्रोतुमिच्छामि तत्त्वतः॥<br />For what reasons what kinds of gifts made to what persons yield merits? Indeed, to what persons should what gifts be made? For what reasons are how many kinds of gifts to be made? I wish to hear all this in full.</p>
<p id='4'>भीष्म उवाच शृणु तत्त्वेन कौन्तेय दानं प्रति ममानघ। यथा दानं प्रदातव्यं सर्ववर्णेषु भारत॥<br />Bhishma said Listen, O son of Kunti, in full to me, O sinless one, as I describe the subject of gifts. Indeed, I shall tell you, Bharata, how gifts should be made to all the orders of men.</p>
<p id='5'>धर्मादाद् भयात् कामात् कारुण्यादिति भारत। दानं पञ्चविधं ज्ञेयं कारणैर्निबोध तत्॥<br />Gifts are made from desire of merit, from desire of profit, from fear, from free choice, and from pity. O Bharata! Gifts, therefore, should be known to be of five sorts. Listen now to the reasons for which gifts are thus divided into five classes.</p>
<p id='6'>इह कीर्तिमवाप्नोति प्रेत्य चानुत्तमं सुखम्। इति दानं प्रदातव्यं ब्राह्मणेभ्योऽनसूयता॥<br />With mind shorn of malice, one should make gifts to Brahmanas, for by making gifts to them one wins fame in this world and great happiness in the next.</p>
<p id='7'>ददाति वा दास्यति वा मह्यं दत्तमनेन वा। इत्यर्थिभ्यो निशम्यैव सर्वं दातव्यमर्थिने॥<br />He is in the habit of making gifts; or he will make gifts; or he has already made gifts to me. Hearing such words from solicitors, one gives away all kinds of riches to a particular solicitor.</p>
<p id='8'>नास्याहं न मदीयोऽयं पापं कुर्याद् विमानितः। इति दद्याद् भयादेव इंढ मूढाय पण्डितः॥<br />I am not his, nor is he mine. If disregarded, he may injure me. From such motives of fear even a learned and wise man may make gifts to an ignorant wretch.</p>
<p id='9'>प्रियो मेऽयं प्रियोऽस्याहमिति सम्प्रेक्ष्य बुद्धिमान्। वयस्यामैवमक्लिष्टं दानं दद्यादतन्द्रितः॥<br />This one is dear to me. I also am dear to him. Actuated by considerations like these, an intelligent person, freely and with alacrity, makes gifts to a friend.</p>
<p id='10'>दीनश्च याचते चायमल्पेनापि हि तुष्यति। इति दद्याद् दरिद्राय कारुण्यादिति सर्वथा॥<br />The person who solicits me is poor. He is, again, satisfied with little. From considerations such as these, one should always make gifts to the poor, moved by pity.</p>
<p id='11'>इति पञ्चविधं दानं पुण्यकीर्तिविवर्धनम्। यथाशक्त्या प्रदातव्यमेवमाह प्रजापतिः॥<br />These are the five sorts of gift. They increase the giver's merits and fame. The Lord of all creatures has said that one should always make gifts according to his power. a</p>
