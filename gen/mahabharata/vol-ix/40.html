<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 40</h3><h4>The creation of woman and the object thereof. The story of Vipula and Devasharman</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>भीष्म उवाच एवमेव महाबाहो नात्र मिथ्यास्ति किंचन। यथा ब्रवीषि कौरव्य नारी प्रति जनाधिप॥<br />Bhishma said It is true what you say, O you of mighty arms. There is nothing untrue in all this that you say, O you of Kuru's race, on the subject of women, O monarch!</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>अत्र ते वर्तयिष्यामि इतिहासं पुरातनम्। यथा रक्षा कृता पूर्वं विपुलेन महात्मना॥<br />About it I shall recite to you the old history of how in days of yore the great Vipula had succeeded in restraining women within the limits laid down for them.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>प्रमदाश्च यथा सृष्टा ब्रह्मणा भरतर्षभ। यदर्थं तच्च ते तात प्रवक्ष्यामि नराधिप।॥<br />I shall also tell you, O king, how women were created by the Grandfather Brahman and the object for which they were created by him.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>न हि स्त्रीभ्यः परं पुत्र पापीयः किंचिदस्ति वै। अग्निर्हि प्रमदा दीप्तो मायाश्च मयजा विभो॥<br />There is no creature more sinful, O son, than woman. Woman is a burning fire. She is the illusion, o king, that the Daitya Maya created.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>क्षुरधारा विषं सर्पो वह्रिरित्येकतः स्त्रियः। प्रजा इमा महाबाहो धार्मिक्य इति नः श्रुतम्॥ स्वयं गच्छन्ति देवत्वं ततो देवानियाद् भयम्।<br />She is the sharp edge of the razor. She is poison. She is a snake. She is fire. She is verily, all these in a body. We have heard that all human beings beings are characterised by righteousness, and that they, in course of natural progress and improvement, attain to the dignity of god. This circumstance alarmed the celestials.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>अथाभ्यगच्छन् देवास्ते पितामहमरिंदम॥ निवेद्य मानसं चापि तूष्णीमासन्नधोमुखाः।<br />They, therefore, O chastiser of foes, assembled together and went to the Grandfather. Informing Him of what was in their minds, they stood silent before him with downcast eyes.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>तेषामन्तर्गतं ज्ञात्वा देवानां स पितामहः॥ मानवानां प्रमोहार्थे कृत्या नार्योऽसृजत् प्रभुः।<br />Having learnt what was in the hearts of the celestials, the powerful Grandfather created women with the help of an Atharvan rite.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>पूर्वसर्गे तु कौन्तेय साध्व्यो नार्य इहाभवन्॥ असाध्व्यस्तु समुत्पन्नाः कृत्याः सर्गात् प्रजापतेः। ताभ्यः कामान् यथाकामं प्रादाद्धि स पितामहः॥<br />In a former creation, O son of Kunti, women were all virtuous. Those however, that sprang from this creation by Brahman with the help of an illusion, became sinful. The Grandfather bestowed upon them the desire of enjoying all kinds of carnal pleasure.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>ताः कामलुब्धाः प्रमदाः प्रबाधन्ते नरान् सदा। क्रोधं कामस्य देवेशः सहायं चासृजत् प्रभुः॥<br />Tempted by the desire of enjoyment, they began to pursue persons of the other sex. The powerful lord of the deities created Anger as the companion of Lust.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>असज्जन्त प्रजाः सर्वाः कामक्रोधवशं गताः। न च स्त्रीणां क्रियाः काश्चिदिति धर्मो व्यवस्थितः।।११<br />Persons of the male sex, yielding to the power of Lust and Anger, sought the companionship of women. Women have no especial acts laid down for them. This is the ordinance that was laid down.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>निरिन्द्रिया ह्यशास्त्राश्च स्त्रियोऽनृतमिति श्रुतिः। शय्यासनमलंकारमन्नपानमनार्यताम्॥ दुर्वाग्भावं रतिं चैव ददौ स्त्रीभ्यः प्रजापतिः। न तासां रक्षणं शक्यं कर्तुं पुंसा कथंचन॥ अपि विश्वकृता तात कुतस्तु पुरुषैरिह।<br />The Shruti declares that women are gifted with the most powerful senses that they have no scriptures to follow, and that they are living lies. Beds, seats, ornaments, food and drink and the absence of all that is respectable and righteous, indulgence in disagreeable words, and love of sexual companionship these were bestowed by Brahman upon women. Men are quite unable to restrain them within limits.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>वाचा च वधबन्धैर्वा क्लेशैर्वा विविधैस्तथा॥ न शक्या रक्षितुं नार्यस्ता हि नित्यमसंयताः।<br />The Creator himself is incapable of keeping them within proper limits, what need then be said of men?</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>इदं तु पुरुषव्याघ्र पुरस्ताच्छुतवानहम्॥ यथा रक्षा कृता पूर्वं विपुलेन गुरुस्त्रियाः।<br />This, O chief of men, I heard in former days viz., how Vipula had succeeded in protecting his preceptor's wife in ancient times.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>ऋषिरासीन्महाभागो देवशर्मेति विश्रुतः॥ तस्य भार्या रुचिर्नाम रूपेणासदृशी भुवि।<br />There was in days of yore a highly blessed Rishi of the name of Devasharman of great fame. He had a wife of name Ruchi, who was peerless on Earth in beauty.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>तस्या रूपेण सम्मत्ता देवगन्धर्वदानवाः॥ विशेषेण तु राजेन्द्र वृत्रहा पाकशासनः।<br />Her loveliness intoxicated every one among the celestials and Gandharvas and Danavas. The chastiser of Paka, viz., Indra, the destroyer of Vritra, O king, was in particular enamoured of her and coveted her body.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>नारीणां चरितज्ञश्च देवशर्मा महामुनिः॥ यथाशक्ति यथोत्साहं भार्यां तामभ्यरक्षत।<br />The great ascetic Devasharman fully knew the disposition of women. He therefore, to the best of his power and energy, protected her.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>पुरन्दरं च जानीते परस्त्रीकामचारिणम्॥ तस्माद् बलेन भार्याया रक्षणं स चकार ह।<br />The Rishi knew that Indra had not scruples in seeking the companionship of other people's wives. It was therefore, that he used to protect his wife, putting forth all his power.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>स कदाचिदृषिस्तात यज्ञं कर्तुमनास्तदा॥ भार्यासंरक्षणं कार्यं कथं स्यादित्यचिन्तयत्।<br />Once on a time. O son, the Rishi became desirous of celebrating a sacrifice. He began to think of how (during his own absence from home) his wife could be protected.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>रक्षाविधानं मनसा स संचिन्त्य महातपाः॥ आहूय दयितं शिष्यं विपुलं प्राह भार्गवम्।<br />Gifted with high ascetic merit, he at last hit upon the course he should adopt. Summoning his favourite disciple whose name was Vipula and who was of Bhrigu's family, he said as follows.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>देवशर्मन् उवाच यज्ञकारो गमिष्यामि रुचिं चेमां सुरेश्वरः॥ यतः प्रार्थयते नित्यं तां रक्षस्व यथाबलम्।<br />Devasharman said I shall leave home in order to celebrate a sacrifice. The king of the celestials always covets this Ruchi of mine. Do you, during my absence, protect her, displaying all your power.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>अप्रमत्तेन ते भाव्यं सदा प्रति पुरन्दरम॥ स हि रूपाणि कुरुते विविधानि भृगूत्तम।<br />You shall pass your time carefully in view of Purandara. O foremost one of Bhrigu's race, that Indra assumes various forms.</p>

Once more, however, as his preceptor was about to start, Vipula asked him in these words.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>विपुल उवाच कानि रूपाणि शक्रस्य भवन्त्यागच्छतो मुने। वपुस्तेजश्च कीदृग्वै तन्मे व्याख्यातुमर्हसि॥<br />Vipula said Tell me, O Muni, what forms does Shakra assume when he comes. Of what kinds is his body and what is his energy? You should tell me all this.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>भीष्म उवाच ततः स भगवांस्तस्मै विपुलाय महात्मने। आचचक्षे यथातत्त्वं मायां शक्रस्य भारत।॥<br />Bhishma said The illustrious Rishi then truly described to the great Vipula all the illusions of Shakra, O Bharata.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>देवशर्मन् उवाच बहुमायः स विप्रर्षे भगवान् पाकशासनः। तांस्तान् विकुरुते भावान् बहूनथ मुहुर्मुहुः॥<br />Devasharman said The powerful chastiser of Paka, . regenerate Rishi, is full of illusion. Every moment he assumes those forms that he chooses.</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>किरीटी वज्रधृग् धन्वी मुकुटी बद्धकुण्डलः॥ भवत्यथ मुहूर्तेन चण्डालसमदर्शनः।<br />Sometimes he wears a diadem and holds the thunderbolt. Sometimes, armed with the thunder bolt and wearing a crown on his head, he adorns himself with earrings. In a moment he changes himself into the shape and aspect of Chandala.</p>

<p id='29'><a href='#29'></a>ब्राह्मणः क्षत्रियश्चैव वैश्यः शूद्रस्तथैव च॥ प्रतिलोमोऽनुलोमश्च भवत्यथ शतक्रतुः।<br />Sometimes he appears as a Brahmana, sometimes as a Kshatriya, sometimes as a Vaishya, and sometimes as a Shudra. Indeed, he of a hundred sacrifices appears at times as a person born of impure caste, that is, as the son of a superior father by an inferior mother or of an inferior father by a superior mother.</p>
<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>शुकवायसरूपी च हंसकोकिलरूपवान्॥ सिंहव्याघ्रगजानां च रूपं धारयते पुनः।<br />Sometimes he appears a parrot, sometimes as a crow, sometimes as a swan and sometimes as a koel. He assumes the forms also of a lion, a tiger or an elephant.</p>
<p id='31'><a href='#31'></a>दैवं दैत्यमथो राज्ञां वपुर्धारयतेऽपि च॥ अकृशो वायुभग्नाङ्गः शकुनिर्विकृतस्ताया।<br />Sometimes he appears as a god, sometimes as a Daitya and sometimes he assumes the guise of a king. Sometimes he appears as fat and plump, sometimes as one whose limbs have been broken by the disordered wind in the system, sometimes as a bird, and sometimes as one of an exceedingly ugly form.</p>

<p id='33'><a href='#33'></a>न शक्यमस्य ग्रहणं कर्तुं विपुल केनचित्॥ अपि विश्वकृता तात येन सृष्टमिदं जगत्।<br />O Vipula, no one can make him out on account of these numberless disguises that he is capable of assuming. The very Creator of the universe is not equal to that feat.</p>
