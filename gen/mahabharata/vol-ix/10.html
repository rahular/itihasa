After the rites in honour of the Pitris had been finished, the Rishi, was sent away the Shudra, whercupon he returned to his own abode. After a long time, the whole of which he passed practising such penances and vows, the Shudra ascetic died in the those woods. On account of I the merit he acquired by those practices, the Shudra, in his next life, was born in the family of a great king, and in time became possessed of great splendour. The twiceborn Rishi also, when the time came, paid his debt to Nature.</p>
<p id='28'><a href='#28'></a>पुरोहितकुले विप्र आजातो भरतर्षभ। एवं तौ तत्र सम्भूतावुभौ शूद्रमुनी तदा॥<br />In his next life, O chief of Bharata's race, he was born in the family of a priest. Thus those two, viz., that Shudra who had passed a life of penances and that twiceborn Rishi who had out of kindness given the former some instructions in the matter of the rites performed in honour of the Pitris, became reborn, the one as the son of a royal race and the other as the member of a priestly family.</p>

<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>कल्पप्रयोगे चोत्पन्ने ज्योतिषे च परं गतः॥ सांख्ये चैव परा प्रीतिस्तस्य चैवं व्यवर्धत।<br />The reborn Rishi gained great perfection in all sacrifices ordained in the Sutras, of the Vedanga which deals with religious rites and observances, astrology and astronomy. He took great pleasure in the Sankhya philosophy too.</p>
<p id='31'><a href='#31'></a>पितर्युपरते चापि कृतशौचस्तु पार्थिव॥ अभिषिक्तः प्रकृतिभी राजपुत्रः स पार्थिवः।<br />Meanwhile, the reborn Shudra who had become a prince, when his father the king died, performed his last rites; and after he had purified himself by performing all the obsequial rites, he was installed by the subjects of his father as their king on his paternal throne.</p>
<p id='32'><a href='#32'></a>अभिषिक्तेन स ऋषिरभिषिक्तः पुरोहितः॥ स तं पुरोधाय सुखमवसद् भरतर्षभ।<br />But soon after his own installation as king, he installed the rebora Rishi as his priest. Having made the Brahmana his priest, the king began to pass his days happily.</p>

Every day, however, the king, seeing his priest on the occasion of receiving benedictions from him as also of the performance of religious and other sacred rites, smiled or laughed loudly.

<p id='41'><a href='#41'></a>सव्रीडं वै भवति हि मनो मे हसता त्वया। कामया शापितो राजन् नान्यथा वक्तुमर्हसि॥<br />Seeing you laugh at me on all occasions, my mind shrinks with shame, I have made you promise, O king, that you would answer me truly. You should not tell an untruth.</p>
<p id='42'><a href='#42'></a>सुव्यक्तं कारणं ह्यत्र न ते हास्यमकारणम्। कौतूहलं मे सुभृशं तत्त्वेन कथयस्व मे॥<br />There must be some grave reason for your conduct. Your laughter cannot be causeless. I have great curiosity to know the reason. Do you speak truly to me.</p>

On account of this transgression of yours you are born as a priest.</p>

O best of kings, the Brahmana should never desire to acquire instruction from, or impart instruction to, a person who belongs to the lowest order.</p>
<p id='59'><a href='#59'></a>ब्राह्मणा: क्षत्रिया वैश्यास्त्रयो वर्णा द्विजातयः। एतेषु कथयन् राजन् ब्राह्मणो न प्रदुष्यति॥<br />Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, these three orders, are considered as twice born. By delivering instruction to these, a Brahmana does not commit any sin.</p>

The course of morality is highly subtle and incapable of being understood by persons of uncleansed soul.</p>
<p id='61'><a href='#61'></a>तस्मान्मौनेन मुनयो दीक्षां कुर्वन्ति चादृताः। दुरुक्तस्य भयाद् नाभाषन्ते च किंचन॥<br />It is for this reason that ascetics adopt the vow of silence, and, honoured by all, pass through initiation without speaking a single word, For fear of saying what is incorrect or what may offend, ascetics never utter a single word.</p>
<p id='62'><a href='#62'></a>धार्मिका गुणसम्पन्नाः सत्यार्जवसमन्विताः। दुरुक्तवाचाभिहितैः प्राप्नुवन्तीह दुष्कृतम्॥<br />Even men who are righteous and endued with every accomplishment, and truth and simplicity of conduct, have been known to commit great sin on account of words spoken improperly.</p>
<p id='63'><a href='#63'></a>उपदेशो न कर्तव्यः कदाचिदपि कस्यचित्। उपदेशाद्धि तत् पापं ब्राह्मण: समवाप्नुयात्॥<br />Instruction should never be given on anything to any person. If on account of the instructions given, the instructed cominit any sin, that sin attaches to the Brahmana who gave the instruction.</p>
<p id='64'><a href='#64'></a>विमृश्य तस्मात् प्राज्ञेन वक्तव्यं धर्ममिच्छता। सत्यानृतेन हि कृत उपदेशो हिनस्ति हि॥<br />The wise man, therefore, who wishes to acquire merit, should always act with wisdom. That instruction which is given in exchange for money always sullies the instructor.</p>
<p id='65'><a href='#65'></a>वक्तव्यमिह पृष्टेन विनिश्चित्य विनिश्चयम्। स चोपदेशः कर्तव्यो येन धर्ममवाप्नुयात्॥<br />Requested by others, one should say only what is correct after determining it with the help of reflection. One should give instruction in such a way that one may, by giving it, acquire merit.</p>
<p id='66'><a href='#66'></a>एतत् ते सर्वमाख्यातमुपदेशकृते मया। महान् केशो हि भवति तस्मान्नोपदिशेदिह॥<br />I have thus told you everything about instructions very often persons become plunged into great afflictions on account of giving instruction. Hence it is proper that one should abstain from giving instruction to others.</p>
