<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 160</h3><h4>Shata Rudriya Mantra</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच दुर्वाससः प्रसादात् ते यत् तदा मधुसूदन। अवाप्तमिह विज्ञानं तन्मे व्याख्यातुमर्हसि॥<br />Yudhishthira said You should, O destroyer of Madhu, explain lo me that knowledge which you have acquired through the favour of Durvasas.</p>
<p id='2'>महाभाग्यं च यत् तस्य नामानि च महात्मनः। तत् त्वत्तो ज्ञातुमिच्छामि सर्वं मतिमतां वर॥<br />O foremost of all persons having intelligence, I wish to know everything about the great blessedness and all the names of that great one truly and in detail!</p>
<p id='3'>वासुदेव उवाच हन्त ते कीर्तयिष्यामि नमस्कृत्य कपर्दिने। यदवाप्तं मया राजच्छ्रेयो यच्चार्जितं यशः॥<br />Vasudeva said I shall recite to you the good which I have acquired and the fame which I have won through the favour of that great one. I shall describe to you the subject, after having bowed unto Kaparddin.</p>
<p id='4'>प्रयतः प्रातरुत्थाय यदधीये विशाम्पते। प्राञ्जलिः शतरुद्रीयं तन्मे निगदतः शृणु॥<br />O king, listen to me as I recite to you that Shatarudriya which I repeat, with controlled senses, every morning after rising from bed.</p>
<p id='5'>प्रजापतिस्तत् ससृजे तपसोऽन्ते महातपाः। शङ्कररत्वसृजत् तात प्रजा: स्थावरजङ्गमाः॥<br />The great lord of all creatures, viz., the Grandfather Brahman himself, having penances for riches, composed those Mantras, after having observed especial penances for some time. O sire, it is Shankara who created all the creatures in the universe, mobile and immobile.</p>
<p id='6'>नास्ति किंचित्परं भूतं महादेवाद् विशाम्पते। इह त्रिष्वपि लोकेषु भूतानां प्रभावो हि सः॥<br />There is no being who is superior, O monarch, lo Mahadeva. He is the highest of all beings in the three worlds.</p>
<p id='7'>न चैबोत्सहते स्थातुं कश्चिदने महात्मनः। न हि भूतं समं तेन त्रिषु लोकेषु विद्यते॥<br />There is no one who is capable of attending before the great Being. Indeed, there is no Being in the three worlds who is his equal.</p>
<p id='8'>गन्धेनापि हि संग्रामे तस्य क्रुद्धस्य शत्रवः। विसंज्ञा हतभूयिष्ठा वेपन्ते च पतन्ति च॥<br />When he stands, filled with anger, on the field of battle, the very scent of his body deprives all foes of consciousness and they who are not killed tremble and fall down.</p>
<p id='9'>घोरं च निनदं तस्य पर्जन्यनिनदोपमम्। श्रुत्वा विशीर्येद्धृदयं देवानामपि संयुगे॥<br />His roars are terrible, like the mutterings of clouds. Hearing those roars in battle, the very hearts of the celestials break in twain.</p>
<p id='10'>यांश्च घोरेण रूपेण पश्येत् क्रुद्धः पिनाकधृत्। न सुरा नासुरा लोके न गन्धर्वा न पन्नगाः॥ कुपिते सुखमेधन्ते तस्मिन्नपि गुहागताः। प्रजापतेश्च दक्षस्य यजतो वितते क्रतौ॥ विव्याध कुपितो यज्ञं निर्भयस्तु भवस्तदा। धनुषा बाणमुत्सृज्य सघोषं विननाद च॥<br />When the holder of Pinaka becomes angry and assuming a terrible mien merely casts his eye upon deity, Asura, Gandharva, or snake, that individual cannot obtain peace of mind by taking shelter in the recesses of even a mountain cave. When that lord of all creatures, viz., Daksha, desirous of celebrating a sacrifice, spread his sacrifice out, the brave Bhava, yielding to anger (at Daksha's slight of him), pierced the Sacrifice. Shooting his arrow from his terrible bow, he roared aloud.</p>
<p id='11'>ते न शर्म कुतः शान्ति विषादं लेभिरे सुराः। विद्धे च सहसा यज्ञे कुपिते च महेश्वरे॥<br />Indeed, when Maheshvara became angry and suddenly pierced with his arrow the embodied form of sacrifice, the celestials became filled with sorrow, losing happiness and tranquility of heart.</p>
<p id='12'>तेन ज्यातलघोषेण सर्वे लोकाः समाकुलाः। बभूवुरवशाः पार्थ विषेदुश्च सुरासुराः॥<br />On account of the iwang of his bowstring the whole universe became agitated. The celestials and the Asuras, O son of Pritha, all became cheerless and stupefied.</p>
<p id='13'>आपश्चुक्षुभिरे चैव चकम्पे च वसुन्धरा। व्यद्रवन् गिरयश्चापि द्यौः पफाल च सर्वशः॥<br />The Ocean rolled in agitation and the Earth trembled to her centre. The hills and mountains began to move from their bases and ran on all sides. The Vault of the sky became cracked.</p>
<p id='14'>अन्धेन तमसा लोकाः प्रावृता न चकाशिरे। प्रणष्टा ज्योतिषां भाश्च सह सूर्येण भारत॥<br />All the worlds became covered with darkness. Nothing could be seen. The light of all the luminaries became darkened, along with that of the Sun himself, O Bharata.</p>
<p id='15'>भृशं भीतास्ततः शान्तिं चक्रुः स्वस्त्ययनानि च। ऋषयः सर्वभूतानामात्मनश्च हितैषिणः॥<br />The great Rishis, stricken with fear and desirous of doing good to themselves and the universe, performed the usual usual rites of propitiation and peace.</p>
<p id='16'>ततः सोऽभ्यद्रवद् देवान् रुद्रो रौद्रपराक्रमः। भगस्य नयने क्रुद्धः प्रहारेण व्यशातयत्॥<br />Meanwhile, Rudra of terrible prowess rushed against the celestials. Filled with anger, he tore out the eyes of Bhaga.</p>
<p id='17'>पूषणं चाभिदुद्राव पादेन च रुषान्वितः। पुरोडाशं भक्षयतो दशनान् वै व्यशातयत्॥<br />Excited with anger, he attacked Pushan with his foot. He tore out the teeth of that god as he satemployed in cating the large sacrificial ball (called Purodasha).</p>
<p id='18'>ततः प्रणेमुर्देवास्ते वेपमानाः स्म शङ्करम्। पुनश्च संदधे रुद्रो दीप्तं सुनिशितं शरम्॥<br />Trembling with fear, the celestials bent their heads to Shankara. Without being appeased, Rudra once more placed on his bowstring a sharp and blazing arrow.</p>
<p id='19'>रुद्रस्य विक्रमं दृष्ट्वा भीता देवाः सहर्षिभिः। ततः प्रसादयामासुः शर्वं ते विबुधोत्तमाः॥<br />Seeing his prowess, the celestials and the Rishis became all alarmed. Those foremost of gods began to pacify him.</p>
<p id='20'>जेपुश्च शतरुद्रीयं देवाः कृत्वाञ्जलिं तदा। संस्तूयमानस्त्रिदशैः प्रससाद महेश्वरः॥<br />Joining their hands in respect, they began to recite the Shata Rudriya Mantras. Thus lauded by the celestials, at last Maheshvara became gratified.</p>
<p id='21'>रुद्रस्य भागं यज्ञे च विशिष्टं ते त्वकल्पयन्। भयेन त्रिदशा राजञ्छरणं च प्रपेदिरे॥<br />The deities then assigned a large share to him. Trembling with fear, O king, they sought refuge with him.</p>
<p id='22'>तेन चैव हि तुष्टेन स यज्ञः संधितोऽभवत्। यद् यच्चापहृतं तत्र तत्तथैवान्वजीवयत्॥<br />When Rudra became pleased, the embodiment of sacrifice, which had been cut in twain, became once more united. Whatever limbs of his had been destroyed by the arrows of Mahadeva, became once more whole and sound.</p>
<p id='23'>असुराणां पुराण्यासंस्त्रीणि वीर्यवतां दिवि। आयसं राजतं चैव सौवर्णमपि चापरम्॥<br />The Asuras gifted with great energy had formerly threc cities in the firmament. One of these had been, made of iron; one of silver; and the third of gold.</p>
<p id='24'>नाशकत् तानि मघवा जेतुं सर्वायुधैरपि। अथ सर्वेऽमरा रुद्रं जग्मुः शरणमर्दिताः॥<br />With all his weapons, Maghavat the chief of the celestials, was unable to pierce those cities. Afflicted by the Asuras, all the celestials then sought the protection of the great Rudra.</p>
<p id='25'>तत ऊचुर्महात्मानो देवाः सर्वे समागताः। रुद्र रौद्रा भविष्यन्ति पशवः सर्वकर्मसु॥<br />The highsouled celestials in a body addressed him, saying, O Rudra, the Asuras threaten to display their destructive influence in all deeds.</p>
<p id='26'>जहि दैत्यान् सह पुरैर्लोकांस्त्रयस्व मानद। स तथोक्तस्तथेत्युक्त्वा कृत्वा विष्णुं शरोत्तमम्॥<br />Do you kill the demons and destroy their city for the protection of the three worlds, giver of honours! Thus accosted by them, he replied, saying, So be it! and then made Vishnu his excellent shafthcad.</p>
<p id='27'>शल्यमग्निं तथा कृत्वा पुङ्गं वैवस्वतं यमम्। वेदान् कृत्वा धनुः सर्वान् ज्यां च सावित्रिमुत्तमाम्।।<br />He made the deity of fire his shaftrced, and the SunGod's son Yama the wings of that arrow. He made the Vedas his bow and the goddess Savittri his excellent bowstring.</p>
<p id='28'>ब्रह्माणं सारथिं कृत्वा विनियुज्य च सर्वशः। त्रिपर्वणा त्रिशल्येन तेन तानि बिभेद सः॥<br />And he made the Grandfather Brahman his charioteer. Applying all these, he pierced the triple city of the Asuras with that arrow of his, consisting of three Parvans and three Shalyas.</p>
<p id='29'>शरेणादित्यवर्णेन कालाग्निसमतेजसा। तेऽसुराः सपुरास्तत्र दग्धा रुद्रेण भारत॥<br />Indeed, O Bharata, the Asuras with their cities, were all burnt by Rudra with that arrow which had solar effulgence and whose energy resembled that of the fire which appcars at the end of the cycle for consuming all things.</p>
<p id='30'>तं चैवाङ्कगतं दृष्ट्वा बालं पञ्चशिखं पुनः। उमा जिज्ञासमाना वै कोऽयमित्यब्रवीत् तदा॥<br />Seeing that Mahadeva changed into a child with five locks of hair lying on the lap of Parvati, the latter asked the celestials as to who he was.</p>
<p id='31'>असूयतश्च शक्रस्य वज्रेण प्रहरिष्यतः। स वज्रं स्तम्भयामासं तं बाहुं परिघोपमम्॥<br />Seeing the child, Shakra became suddenly filled with jealousy and anger and determined to kill him with his thunder. The child, however, paralysed the arm, appearing like a mace of iron, of Indra with the thunderbolt in it.</p>
<p id='32'>न सम्बुबुधिरे चैव देवास्तं भुवनेश्वरम्। सप्रजापतयः सर्वे तस्मिन् मुमुहुरीश्वरे॥<br />The celestials all became stupefied, and they could not understand that child was the Master of the universe. Indeed, all of them, along with the very Regents of the world, found their intellects stupefied about that child who was none else than the Supreme Being.</p>
<p id='33'>ततो ध्यात्वा च भगवान् ब्रह्मा तममितौजसम्। अयं श्रेष्ठ इति ज्ञात्वा ववन्दे तमुमापतिम्॥<br />Then reflecting with the help of his penances, the Illustrious Grandfather Brahman found out that that child was the foremost of al! beings, the lord of Uma, Mahadeva of immeasurable prowess. He then lauded the Lord.</p>
<p id='34'>ततः प्रसादयामासुरुमां रुद्रं च ते सुराः। बभूव स तदा बाहुर्बलहन्तुर्यथा पुरा॥ स चापि ब्राह्मणो भूत्वा दुर्वासा नाम वीर्यवान्। द्वारवत्यां मम गृहे चिरं कालमुपावसन्॥<br />The celestials also began to sing the praises of both Uma and Rudra. The arm (which had been paralysed) of the destroyer of Vala then became restored to its former state. That Mahadeva, taking birth as the highly energetic Brahmana Durvasas, lived for a long time at Dvaravati in my house.</p>
<p id='35'>विप्रकारान् प्रयुक्ते स्म सुबहून् मम वेश्मनि। तानुदारतया चाहं चक्षमे चातिदुःसहान्॥<br />While living in my house he committed various mischief's. Thought difficult of being borne. I suffered them yet from magnanimity of heart.</p>
<p id='36'>रुद्रः स च शिवः सोऽग्निः सर्वः स सर्वजित्। स चैवेन्द्रश्च वायुश्च सोऽश्विनौ स च विद्युतः॥<br />He is Rudra; he is Shiva; he is Agni; he is Sarva; he is the defeater of all; he is Indra, and Vayu, and the Ashvins and the god of lightning.</p>
<p id='37'>स चन्द्रमाः स चेशानः स सूर्यो वरुणश्च सः। स काल: सोऽन्तको मृत्युः स यमो रात्र्यहानि च।। मासार्धमासा ऋतवः संध्ये संवत्सरश्च सः। स धाता स विधाता च विश्वकर्मा स सर्ववित्॥<br />He is the Moon; he is Ishana; he is the Sun; he is Varuna; he is Time; he is the Destroyer; he is death; he is the day and the Night; he is the fortnight; he is the seasons; he is the two twilghts; he is the year. He is Dhatri; and he is Vidhatri; and he is Vishwakarinan; and he knows all things.</p>
<p id='38'>वै नक्षत्राणि गृहाश्चैव दिशोऽथ प्रदिशस्तथा। विश्वमूर्तिरमेयात्मा भगवान् परमद्युतिः॥<br />He is the cardinal points of the compass and the subsidiary points also. Of universal form, he is of great soul. The holy and illustrious Durvasas is of the colour of the celestials.</p>
<p id='39'>एकधा च द्विधा चैव बहुधा च स एव हि। शतधा सहस्रधा चैव तथा शतसहस्रधा॥<br />He sometimes shows himself singly; sometimes divides himself into two parts; and sometimes shows himself in many a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, forms.</p>
<p id='40'>ईदृशः स महादेवो भूयश्च भगवानतः। न हि शक्या गुणा वक्तुमपि वर्षशतैरपि॥<br />Even such is Mahadeva. He is, again, that god who is unborn. In even a hundred years, one cannot exhaust his merits by rccounting them.</p>
