<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 67</h3><h4>The merits of the gifts of drink</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच श्रुतं दानफलं तात यत् त्वया परिकीर्तितम्। अन्नदानं विशेषेण प्रशस्तमिह भारत॥<br />Yudhishthira said I have heard, O sire, of the merits of the different kinds of gift which you have described to me. I understand, O Bharata, that the gift of food is especially praiseworthy and superior.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>पानीयदानमेवैतत् कथं चेह महाफलम्। इत्येतच्छ्रोतुमिच्छामि विस्तरेण पितामह॥<br />What, however, are the great merits of making gifts of drink. I wish to hear of this in full, O grandfather.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>भीष्म उवाच हन्त ते वर्तयिष्यामि यथावद् भरतर्षभ। गदतस्तन्ममाघेह शृणु सत्यपराक्रम॥<br />Bhishma said I shall, O chief of Bharata's race. relate to you this subject. Listen to ine, O you of unbaffled prowess, as I speak to you.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>पानीयदानात् प्रभृति सर्वं वक्ष्यामि तेऽनघ। यदन्नं यच्च पानीयं सम्प्रदायाश्नुते नरः॥ न तस्मात् परमं दानं किंचिदस्तीति मे मनः। अन्नात् प्राणभृतस्तात प्रवर्तन्ते हि सर्वशः॥<br />I shall, O sinless one, describe to you gifts beginning with that of drink. The merit that a man wins by making gifts of food and of drink is such that the like of it, I think, is incapable of being acquired by any other gift. There is no gift, superior to that of either food or drink. It is from food that all living creatures are able to exist.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>तस्मादन्नं परं लोके सर्वलोकेषु कथ्यते। अन्नाद् बलं च तेजश्च प्राणिनां वर्धते सदा॥<br />Therefore, food is considered as a very superior object in all the worlds. From food the strength and energy of living creatures continually increase.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>अन्नदानमतस्तस्माच्छ्रेष्ठमाह प्रजापतिः। सावित्र्या ह्यपि कौन्तेय श्रुतं ते वचनं शुभम्॥<br />Hence, the master of all creatures has himself said that the gift of food is a very superior gift. You have heard, O son of Kunti, what the auspicious words are of Savitri herself.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>यतश्च यद् यथा चैव देवसत्रे महामते। अन्ने दत्ते नरेणेह प्राणा दत्ता भवन्त्युत॥<br />You know why those words were said what those words were, and how they were said in course of the sacred Mantras, O you of great intelligence. A man, by making a gift of food, really makes a gift of life itself.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>प्राणदानाद्धि परमं न दानमिह विद्यते। श्रुतं हि ते महाबाहो लोमशस्यापि तद्वचः॥<br />There is no gift in this world which is superior to the gift of life. You are not unacquainted with this saying of Lomasha, O you of mighty arms.</p>

<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>पितॄणां च स्वधा प्रोक्ता पशूनां चापि वीरुधः॥ अन्नमेव मनुष्याणां प्राणानाहुर्मनीषिणः।<br />The departed manes have Svadha for their. The animals have herbs and plants for their food. The wise have said that rice, etc., form the food of human beings.</p>

The gift of water is considered as very laudable. It brings on great fame and bestows long life on the giver.</p>

<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>तोयदो मनुजव्याघ्र प्रेत्य चानन्त्यमश्चाति पापेभ्यश्च प्रमुच्यते॥ स्वर्ग गत्वा महाद्युते। अक्षयान् समवाप्नोति लोकानित्यब्रवीन्मनुः॥<br />The giver, O king, becomes purged of every sin and obtains unending happiness hereafter as he proceeds to the celestial region. O you of great splendour. Manu himself has said that such a person acquires regions of endless bliss in the other world.</p>
