<p id='8'>स तं सम्पूज्य तेजस्वी मुनि पृथुललोचनः। पूजितस्तेन च तदा पर्यपृच्छदनामय॥<br />The hero of large eyes and grcat energy adored that ascetic. He was then adored by the ascetic in return Vasudeva then enquired after his well-being.</p>
<p id='9'>स पृष्टः कुशलं तेन सम्पूज्य मधुसूदनम्। उत्तङ्को ब्राह्मणश्रेष्ठस्तत: पप्रच्छ माधवम्॥<br />That foremost of Brahmanas, viz., Utanka, politely accosted by Madhava, honoured him duly and then addressed him in these words.</p>
<p id='10'>कच्चिच्छौरे त्वया गत्वा कुरुपाण्डवसद्म तत्। कृतं सौभ्रात्रमचलं तन्मे व्याख्यातुमर्हसि॥<br />O Shaurin, having gone to the palaces of the Kurus and the Pandavas, have you succeeded in establishing durable understanding between them such as should exit between brothers? You should tell me every thing.</p>
<p id='11'>अपि संधाय तान् वीरानुपावृत्तोऽसि केशव। सम्बन्धिनः स्वदयितान् सततं वृष्णिपुङ्गव॥<br />Do you come, O Keshava, after having united them in peace, them who are your relatives and who are ever dear to you, O forcmost one of Vrishni's race.</p>
<p id='12'>कच्चित् पाण्डुसुताः पच्च धृतराष्ट्रस्य चात्मजाः। लोकेषु विहरिष्यन्ति त्वया सह परंतप॥<br />Will the five sons of Pandu, and the children of Dhritarashtra, o destroyer of enemies, sport in the world in joy with you?</p>

<p id='15'>श्रीभगवानुवाच कृतो यत्नो मया पूर्वे सौम्ये कौवान् प्रति। नाशक्यन्त यदा साम्ये ते स्थापयितुमञ्जसा॥ ततस्ते निधनं प्राप्ताः सर्वे ससुतबान्धवाः। न दिष्टमप्यतिक्रान्तुं शक्यं बुद्ध्या बलेन वा॥<br />I tried my test at first, for bringing about a good understanding, about the Kauravas. When I could not by any means establish them on peace, it happened that all of them, with their relatives and kinsmen, died. It is impossible to transgress destiny by either intelligence of power.</p>
<p id='16'>महर्षे विदितं भूयः सर्वमेतत् तवानघ। तेऽत्यक्रामन् मतिं मह्यं भीष्मस्य विदुरस्य च॥<br />O great Rishi, O sinless one, this also cannot he unknown to you. They (the Kauravas) disregarded which Bhishma and Vidura gave them referring to me.</p>
<p id='17'>ततो यमक्षयं जग्मुः समासाद्येतरेतरम्। पञ्चैव पाण्डवाः शिष्टा हतामित्रा हतात्मजाः। धार्तराष्ट्राश्च निहताः सर्वे ससुतबान्धवाः॥<br />Encountering one another they then becaine guests of Yama's palace. Only the five Pandavas form the remnant of the un-slain, all their friends and all their children having been destroyed. All the sons Dhritarashtra also, with thcir children and kinsmen, have been killed.</p>
<p id='18'>इत्युक्तवचने कृष्णे भृशं क्रोधसमन्वितः। उत्तङ्क इत्युवाचैनं रोषादुत्फुल्ललोचनः॥<br />When Krishna had said these words, Utanka, filled with anger, and with eyes expanded in rage, addressed him in these words.</p>
<p id='19'>यस्माच्छक्तेन ते कृष्ण न त्राताः कुरुपुङ्गवाः। सम्बन्धिनः प्रियास्तस्माच्छप्स्येऽहं त्वामसंशयम्॥<br />Since, though able, O Krishna, you did not rescue those foremost ones of Kuru's race, who were your relatives and, therefore, dear to you, I shall, forsooth, curse you.</p>
<p id='20'>न च ते प्रसभं यस्मात् ते निगृह्य निवारिताः। तस्मान्मन्युपरीतस्त्वां शप्स्यामि मधुसूदन॥<br />Since you did not forcibly compel them to forbear, therefore, O destroyer of Madhu, I shall, filled with anger denounce a course on you.</p>
<p id='21'>त्वया शक्तेन हि सता मिथ्याचारेण माधव। ते परीताः कुरुश्रेष्ठा नश्यन्तः स्म ह्यपेक्षिताः॥<br />It seems, O Madhava, that, though fully able (to save them), you were in different to these foremost of Kurus who, overwhelmed by insincerity and hypocrisy, have all met with destruction.</p>

<p id='23'>श्रुत्वा च मे तदध्यात्म मुञ्चेथाः शापमद्य वै। न च मां तपसाऽल्पेन शक्तोऽभिभवितुं पुमान्॥<br />After having heard my words about the soul, you may then utter your curse. No man is able, by a little ascetic merit, to put me down.</p>
<p id='24'>न च ते तपसो नाशमिच्छामि तपतां वर। तपस्ते सुमहद्दीप्तं गुरवश्चापि तोषिताः॥<br />O foremost of ascetics, I do not wish to see the destruction of all your penances! You have a large measure of blazing penances. You have passed your preceptors and seniors.</p>
<p id='25'>कौमारं ब्रह्मचर्यं ते जानामि द्विजसत्तम। दुःखार्जितस्य तपसस्तस्मन्निच्छामि ते व्ययम्॥<br />O foremost of twice-born ones. I know that you have observed the rules of Brahmacharya from your infancy. I do not, therefore wish the loss or diminution of your penances acquired with so much pain!</p>
