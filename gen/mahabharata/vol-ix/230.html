<h3>ANUGITA PARVA: Chapter 62</h3><h4>Obsequial offerings of Abhimanyu</h4><p id='1'>एतच्छुत्वा तु पुत्रस्य वचः शूरात्मजस्तदा। विहाय शोकं धर्मात्मा ददौ श्राद्धमनुत्तमम्॥<br />Vaishampayana said Having heard these words of his son, Vasudeva, that descendant of Shura, of righteous soul renouncing grief, made excellent obsequial offerings (to Abhimanyu).</p>
<p id='2'>तथैव वासुदेवश्च स्वस्रीयस्य महात्मनः। दयितस्य पितुर्नित्यमकरोदौर्ध्वदेहिकम्॥<br />Vasudeva also performed those rites for the ascension (to Heaven) of his great nephew, that hero who was ever the darling of his father (Vasudeva).</p>

<p id='4'>आच्छाद्य च महाबाहुर्धनतृष्णामपानुदत्। ब्राह्मणानां तदा कृष्णस्तदभूल्लोमहर्षणम्॥ सुवर्णं चैव गाश्चैव शयनाच्छादनानि च। दीयमानं तदा विप्रा वर्धतामिति चाब्रुवन्॥<br />Presenting many clothes to them, Krishna satisfied the thirst for wealth of those Brahmanas. Wonderful were the heaps of gold, the number of kine and of beds and cloths, that were then given away. The Brahmanas loudly declared, Let (Krishna's wealth) increase.</p>

<p id='6'>अतीत दुःखसंतप्ता न शमं चोपलेभिरे। तथैव पाण्डवा वीरा नगरे नागसाह्वये॥<br />Greatly stricken with grief, they could find no comfort. The same was the case with the sons of Pandu in the city of Hastinapure.</p>
<p id='7'>नोपगच्छन्त वै शान्तिमभिमन्युविनाकृताः। सुबहूनि च राजेन्द्र दिवसानि विराटजा॥ नाभुङ्क्त पतिदुःखार्ता तदभूत् करुणं महत्। कुक्षिस्थ एव तस्याथ गर्भो वै सम्प्रलीयत॥<br />Deprived of Abhimanyu, they could get no peace of mind. The daughter of Virata, O king, for many days, totally abstained from all food, greatly afflicted by grief on account of the death of her husband. At this all her relatives, became plunged into excess of grief. They were all afraid that the embryo in her womb might be destroyed.</p>
<p id='8'>आजगाम ततो व्यासो ज्ञात्वा दिव्येन चक्षुषा। समागम्याब्रवीद् धीमान् पृथां पृथुललोचनाम्॥ उत्तरां च महातेजाः शोकः संत्यज्यतामयम्। भविष्यति महातेजाः पुत्रस्तव यशस्विनि॥ प्रभावाद् वासुदेवस्य मम व्याहरणादपि। पाण्डवानामयं चान्ते पालयिष्यति मेदिनीम्॥<br />Then Vyasa, ascertaining the state of things by his spiritual vision, arrived there. The highly intelligent Rishi, gifted with great energy, arrived (at the palace), addressed Pritha of large eyes, as also Uttara herself, saying, Let this grief be given up! O famous lady, a son gifted with great energy will be born to you, through the power of Vasudeva and at my word. That son will rule the Earth after the Pandavas.</p>
<p id='9'>धनंजयं च सम्प्रेक्ष्य धर्मराजस्य शृण्वतः। व्यासो वाक्यमुवाचेदं हर्षयन्निव भारत॥ पौत्रस्तव महाभागो जनिष्यति महामनाः। पृथ्वीं सागरपर्यन्तां पालयिष्यति धर्मतः॥<br />Seeing Dhananjaya, he said to him in the hearing of king Yudhishthira, the just and pleasing him with his words, O Bharata, Your grandson, O highly blessed one, will become a great prince!

<p id='11'>यच्चापि वृष्णिवीरेण कृष्णेन कुरुनन्दन। पुरोक्तं तत् तथा भावा मा तेऽत्रास्तु विचारणा॥<br />That which was uttered by the Vrishni-hero on a former occasion, will, surely, happen! Do not think otherwise.</p>
<p id='12'>विबुधानां गतो लोकानक्षयानात्मनिर्जितान्। न स शोच्यस्त्वया वीरो न चान्यैः कुरुभिस्तथा॥<br />As regards Abhimanyu, he has gone to the regions of the celestials, conquered by him with his own deeds. That hero should be grieved for by you or, indeed, by the other Kurus.</p>
<p id='13'>एवं पितामहेनोक्तो धर्मात्मा स धनंजयः। त्यक्त्वा शोकं महाराज हृष्टरूपोऽभवत् तदा॥<br />Thus addressed by his grandfather, Dhananjaya of righteous soul, O king, renounced his grief and even became cheerful.</p>
<p id='14'>पितापि तव धर्मज्ञ गर्भे तस्मिन् महामते। अवर्धत यथाकामं शुक्लपक्षे यथा शशी॥<br />Your father, O prince, who are conversant with all duties, began to grow in that womb. O you of great intelligence, like the Moon, in the lighted fortnight.</p>
<p id='15'>ततः संचोदयामास व्यासो धर्मात्मजं नृपम्। अश्वमेघ प्रति तदा ततः सोऽन्तर्हितोऽभवत्॥<br />Then Vyasa urged the royal son of Dharma for celebrating the Horse-Sacrifice Having said so, he made himself invisible there and then.</p>
<p id='16'>धर्मराजोऽपि मेधावी श्रुत्वा व्यासस्य तद् वचः। वित्तस्यानयने तात चकार गमने मतिम्॥<br />The intelligent king Yudhishthira, the just, hearing the words of Vyasa, set his mind on the journey for bringing wealth.</p>
