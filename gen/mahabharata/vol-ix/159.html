<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 159</h3><h4>The prosperity following the worship of the Brahmanas</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच ब्रूहि ब्राह्मणपूजायां व्युष्टिं त्वं मधुसूदन। वेत्ता त्वमस्य चार्थस्य वेद त्वां हि पितामहः॥<br />Yudhishthira said Tell us, O destroyer of Madhu, the prosperity which originates from the worship of the Brahmanas. You are a master of this subject. Indeed, our grandfather knows you.</p>
<p id='2'>वासुदेव उवाच शृणुष्वावहितो राजन् द्विजानां भरतर्षभ। यथा तत्त्वेन वदतो गुणान् वै कुरुसत्तम॥<br />Vasudeva said Hear me, O king, with attention, O chief of Bharata's race, as I recite to you what the merits of the Brahmanas are, O foremost one of Kuru's race.</p>
<p id='3'>द्वारवत्यां समासीनं पुरा मां कुरुनन्दन। प्रद्युन्म: परिपप्रच्छ ब्राह्मणैः परिकोपितः॥ किं फलं ब्राह्मणेष्वस्ति पूजायां मधुसूदन। ईश्वरत्वं कुतस्तेषामिहैव च परत्र च॥<br />Once on a time while I was scated at Dvaravati, O delighter of the Kurus, my son Pradyumna, enraged by certain Brahmanas, came to me and said, O destroyer of Madhu, what mcrit is there for adoring the Brahmanas. Whence is their lordship derived both in this world and in the next.</p>
<p id='4'>सदा द्विजातीन् सम्पूज्य किं फलं तत्र मानद। एतद् ब्रूहि स्फुटं सर्वे सुमहान् संशयोऽत्र मे॥<br />O giver of honours, what rewards are gained by constantly adoring the Brahmanas? Kindly explain this clearly to me, for my mind is disturbed by doubts about this.</p>
<p id='5'>इत्युक्ते वचने तस्मिन् प्रद्युम्नेन तथा त्वहम्। प्रत्यब्रुवं महाराज यत् तच्छृणु समाहितः॥<br />When Pradyuinna said, these words to me, I answered him as follows. Do you hear, O king, with rapt attention, what those words were.</p>
<p id='6'>व्युष्टिं ब्राह्मणपूजायां रौक्मिणेय निबोध मे। एते हि सोमराजान ईश्वराः सुखदुःखयोः॥<br />O child of Rukmini, listen to me as I tell you what prosperity one may acquire by adoring the Brahmanas. When one tries to acquire the threefold objects of life (viz., Virtue, Profit and Pleasure). or Emancipation, or fame and prosperity, or the treatment and cure of disease, or the worship of the deities and the departed manes, he should take care to please the twiceborn ones. They are each a king Soma. They are the dispensers of happiness and misery.</p>
<p id='7'>अस्मिल्लोकै रौक्मिणेय तथामुष्मिंश्च पुत्रका ब्राह्मणप्रमुखं सौम्यं न मेऽत्रास्ति विचारणा॥<br />O child of Rukmini, whether in this or in the next world, O son, everything agrecable has originated from the Brahmanas. I have no doubt in this.</p>
<p id='8'>ब्राह्मणप्रतिपूजायामायुः कीर्तिर्यशो बलम्। लोका लोकेश्वराश्चैव सर्वे ब्राह्मणपूजकाः॥ त्रिवर्गे चापवर्गे च यश:श्रीरोगशान्तिषु। देवतापितृपूजासु संतोष्याश्चैव नो द्विजाः॥<br />From the adoration of the Brahinanas originate achievements and fame and strength. Men and the Regents of the universe, adore the Brahmanas. We should satisfy the Brahmanas for the sake of accomplishment on holy deeds, wealth and desires, for attainment of emancipation, fame, grace and health as also at the time of offering pray to gods and Pitris.</p>
<p id='9'>तत्कथं वै नाद्रियेयमीश्वरोऽस्मीति पुत्रका मा ते मन्युर्महाबाहो भवत्वत्र द्विजान् प्रति॥<br />How then, O son, can we disregard them, thinking that we are lords of the Earth? O mighty armed onc, do not allow your anger to embrace the Brahmanas as its objeci.,</p>
<p id='10'>ब्राह्मणा हि महद्भूतमस्मिल्लोके परत्र चा भस्म कुयुर्जगदिदं क्रुद्धाः प्रत्यक्षदर्शिनः॥<br />In this as also the next world, Brahmanas are considered as great Beings. They have direct knowledge of everything in the universe. Verily, they are capable of reducing everything into ashes, if angry.</p>
<p id='11'>अन्यानपि सृजेयुश्च लोकालोकेश्वरांस्तथा। कथं तेषु न वर्तेरन् सम्यग् ज्ञानात् सुतेजसः॥<br />They are capable of creating other worlds and other Regents of worlds. Why then should not persons gifted with energy and true knowledge treat thein with obcdience and respect?</p>
<p id='12'>अवसन्मद्गृहे तात ब्राह्मणो हरिपिङ्गलः। चीरवासा बिल्वदण्डी दीर्घश्मश्रुः कृशो महान्॥<br />Formerly in my house, O son, lived the Brahmana Durvasas whose complexion was green and tawny. Clad in rags, he had a stick made of the Bilva tree. His bcard was long and he was greatly emaciated.</p>
<p id='13'>दीर्धेभ्यश्च मनुष्येभ्यः प्रमाणादधिको भुवि। स स्वैरं चरते लोकान् ये दिव्या ये च मानुषाः॥ इमां गाथां गायमानश्चत्वरेषु सभासु च। दुर्वाससं वासयेत् को ब्राह्मणं सत्कृतं गृहे।॥<br />He was taller in stature than the tallest man on Earth. Wandering over all the worlds of human beings and of the deities and other superior beings, he sang constantly among assemblies and in public squares. Who is there who would cause the Brahmana Durvasas to live in his house, doing the duties of hospitality towards him?</p>
<p id='14'>रोषणः सर्वभूतानां सूक्ष्मेऽप्यपकृते कृते। परिभाषां च मे श्रुत्वा को नु दद्यात् प्रतिश्रयम्॥<br />He becomes wroth with cvery one if he finds even the slightest transgression! Hearing this about my nature, who is there who will give me refuge?</p>
<p id='15'>यो मां कश्चिद् वासयीत न स मां कोपयेदिति। यस्मान्नाद्रियते कश्चित् ततोऽहं समवासयम्॥<br />Indeed, he who would give me shelter as a guest should not do anything to anger me! When I saw that no one ventured to give him shelter in his house, I invited him and made him live in my abode.</p>
<p id='16'>स सम्भुङ्क्ते सहस्राणां बहूनामन्नमेकदा। एकदा सोऽल्पकं भुङ्क्ते न चैवैति पुनर्गृहान्॥<br />On certain days hic would cat the food sufficient for the needs of thousands of persons. On other days he would eat very little. On some days he would go out of my house and would not return.</p>
<p id='17'>अकस्माच्च प्रहसति तथाकस्मात् प्ररोदिति। न चास्य वयसा तुल्यः पृथिव्यामभवत् तदा॥<br />He would sometimes laugh without any reason and sometimes cry uselessly At that time there was nobody on Earth a old as he.</p>
<p id='18'>अथ स्वावसथं गत्वा स शय्यास्तरणानि च। कन्याश्चालंकृता दग्ध्वा ततो व्यपगतः पुनः॥<br />One day, entering the quarters which were given to him, he burnt all the beds and coveriets and all the welladorned damsels who were there for serving him. Doing this, he went Out.</p>
<p id='19'>अथ मामब्रवीद् भूयः स मुनिः संशितव्रतः। कृष्ण पायसमिच्छामि भोक्तुमित्येव सत्वरः॥<br />Of highly praiseworthy vows, he met me shortly after this and addressing me, said, O Krishna, I wish to cal frumenty forthwith.</p>
<p id='20'>तदैव तु मया तस्य चित्तज्ञेन गृहे जनः। सर्वाण्यन्नानि पानानि भक्ष्याश्चोच्चावचास्तथा॥<br />Having understood his mind previously. I had set my servams to prepare every kind of food and drink.</p>
<p id='21'>भवन्तु सत्कृतानीह पूर्वमेव प्रचोदितः। ततोऽहं ज्वलमानं वै पायसं प्रत्यवेदयम्॥<br />Indeed, many excellent viands had been kept ready. As soon as I was asked, I caused hot frumenty to be brought and offered to the ascetic.</p>
<p id='22'>तं भुक्त्वैव स तु क्षिप्रं ततो वचनमब्रवीत्। क्षिप्रमङ्गानि लिम्पस्व पायसेनेति स स्म ह॥<br />Having eaten some, he quickly said to me, O Krishna, take some of this frumenty and smear all your limbs with it.</p>
<p id='23'>अविमृश्यैव च ततः कृतवानस्मि तत् तथा। तेनोच्छिष्टेन गात्राणि शिरश्चैवाभ्यमक्षयम्॥<br />Unhesitatingly I did as directed. Indeed, with the residuc of that frumenty I smeared my body and head.</p>
<p id='24'>स ददर्श तदाभ्याशे मातरं ते शुभाननाम्। तामपि स्मयमानां स पायसेनाभ्यलेपयम्॥<br />The ascetic at that time saw your beautiful mother standing near. Laughing the while, he sineared her body also with that frumenty.</p>
<p id='25'>मुनिः पायसदिग्धाङ्गी रथे तूर्णमयोजयत्। तमारुह्य रथं चैव निर्ययौ स गृहान्मम॥<br />The ascetic then caused your mother, whose body was sicared over with frumenty, to be yoked to a car without any delay. Ascending that car he started from my house.</p>
<p id='26'>अग्निवर्णो ज्वलन् धीमान् स द्विजो रथधुर्यवत्। प्रतोदेनातुदद् वाला रुक्मिणी मम पश्यतः॥<br />Highly intelligent that Brahmana shone with effulgence like fire, and struck, before, me, my youthful Rukmini, as if she were an animal born to drag the cars of human beings.</p>
<p id='27'>न च मे स्तोकमप्यासीद् दुःखीमीर्ष्याकृतं तदा। तथा स राजमार्गेण महता निर्ययौ बहिः॥<br />Secing this, I did not feel the slightest grief bom of malice or the desire to injure the Rishi. Having yoked Rukmini to the car, he went out, desirous of passing along the high road of the city.</p>
<p id='28'>तद् दृष्ट्वा महदाश्चर्ये दाशार्हा जातमन्यवः। तत्राजल्पन् मिथः केचित् समाभाष्य परस्परम्॥ ब्राह्मणा एव जायेरन् नान्यो वर्णः कथंचन। को ह्येनं रथमास्थाय जीवेदन्यः पुमानिह॥<br />Secing that extraordinary spectacle, some Dasharhas, filled with anger, addressed one another and began to converse thus; Who else is there on Earth who would live afier having yoke Rukmini to a car! Indeed, let the world be filled with Bralımanas only! Let no other orders take birth here!</p>
<p id='29'>आशीविषविषं तीक्ष्णं ततस्तीक्ष्णतरो द्विजः। ब्रह्माशीविषदग्धस्य नास्ति कश्चिच्चिकित्सकः॥<br />The poison of a virulent snake greatly powerful. More powerful thc poison is a Brahmana. There is no physician for a person who has been bit or burn by the virulent snake of a Brahmana.</p>
<p id='30'>तस्मिन् व्रजति दुर्धर्षे प्रास्खलद् रुक्मिणी पथि। तन्नामर्षयत श्रीमांस्ततस्तूर्णमचोदयत्॥<br />As the irresistible Durvasas proceeded on the car, Rukmini tottered on the road and frequently dropped down. At this the twiceborn Rishi became angry and began to urge Rukmini on by striking her with the whip.</p>
<p id='31'>ततः परमसंक्रुद्धो रथात् प्रस्कन्ध स द्विजः। पदातिरुत्पथेनैव प्राद्रवद् दक्षिणामुखः॥<br />At last, filled with an irresistible passion, the Brahmana leaped down from the car, and fled towards the south, running on foot, over a pathless ground.</p>
<p id='32'>तमत्पथेन धावन्तमन्वधावं द्विजोत्तमम्। तथैव पायसादिग्धः प्रसीद भगवन्निति॥<br />Seeing that foremost of Brahmanas, flying along the pathless ground, we followed him, although we were smeared with frumenty, exclaiming behind him, Be pleased with us, O holy onc.</p>

<p id='35'>प्रसन्नस्य च मे तात पश्य व्युष्टिं यथाविधि। यावदेव मनुष्याणामन्ने भावो भविष्यति॥ यथैवान्ने तथा तेषां त्वयि भावो भविष्यति। यावच्च पुण्या लोकेषु त्वयि कीर्तिर्भविष्यति॥<br />Behold duly, O son, what the power is of myself when I become pleased with any one. As long as celestials and human beings will continue to entertain a liking for food, so long will every one among them cherish the same liking for you that they cherish for their food. As long, again as there will be Virtue in the several worlds, so long will the fame of your deeds last.</p>
<p id='36'>त्रिषु लोकेषु तावच्च वैशिष्ट्यं प्रतिपत्स्यसे। सुप्रियः सर्वलोकस्य भविष्यसि जनार्दन॥<br />Indeed, your distinction will last so long in the three worlds. O Janardana, agreeable you will be to all persons.</p>
<p id='37'>यत्ते भिन्नं च दग्धं य यच्च किंचिद् विनाशितम्। सर्वं तथैव द्रष्टासि विशिष्टं वा जनार्दन॥<br />Whatever articles of yours have been broken or burnt or otherwise destroyed (by me). you will see restored, O Janardana, to their former state or they will reappear even in a better forin.</p>
<p id='38'>यावदेतत् प्रलिप्तं ते गात्रेषु मधुसूदन। अतो मृत्युभयं नास्ति यावदिच्छसि चाच्युत॥<br />As long again, O) you of unfading glory, as you will wish to live, so long will you have no fear of death attacking you through such parts of your body as have been smeared with the frumenty I gave you.</p>
<p id='39'>न तु पादतले लिप्ते कस्मात्ते पुत्रकाद्य वै। नैतन्मे प्रियमित्येवं स मां प्रीतोऽब्रवीत् तदा॥ इत्युक्तोऽहं शरीरं स्वं ददर्श श्रीसमायुतम्।<br />O son, why did you not smear that frumenty on the soles of your feet as well? By not doing it, you have acted in a way that is not approved by me. These were the words that he said, well pleased with me on that occasion. After he had ceased speaking, I saw that my body became gifted with great beauty and splendour.</p>
<p id='40'>रुक्मिणी चाब्रवीत् प्रीत: सर्वस्त्रीणां वरं यश:।४५ कीर्ति चानुत्तमां लोके समवाप्स्यसि शोभने।<br />To Rukmini also, the Rishi, well pleased with her, said, O beautiful lady, you will be the foremost one of they sex in fame, and you will enjoy great glory, and achievements. You will never suffer from decrepitude or disease or loss of complexion.</p>
<p id='41'>न त्वां जरा वा रोगो वा वैवयं चापि भाविनि।।४६ स्प्रक्ष्यन्ति पुण्यगन्धा च कृष्णमाराधयिष्यसि।<br />Every one will see you engaged in waiting upon Krishna, possessed as you already are with a fragrant odor which is always present in you.</p>
<p id='42'>षोडशानां सहस्राणां वधूनां केशवस्य ह॥ वरिष्ठा च सलोक्या च केशवस्य भविष्यसि।<br />You will become the foremost of all wives, numbering sixteen thousand, of Keshava. At last, when the time comes for your departure from the world, you will acquire the inseparable companionship of Krishna hereafter.</p>
<p id='43'>तव मातरमित्युक्त्वा ततो मां पुनरब्रवीत्॥ प्रस्थितः सुमहातेजा दुर्वासाग्निरिव ज्वलन्। एषैव ते बुद्धिरस्तु ब्राह्मणान्प्रति केशव॥ इत्युक्त्वा स तदा पुत्र तत्रैवान्तरधीयत।<br />Having said these words to your mother, the Rishi once more addressed me and uttering the following words, left the spot. Indeed, the Rishi Durvasa, shining like a fire, said, ) Keshava, may you be so disposed always towards the Brahmanas. After uttering these words, that Brahmana disappeared there and then before my eyes.</p>
<p id='44'>तस्मिन्नन्तर्हिते चाहमुपांशुव्रतमाचरम्॥ यत्किचिद् ब्राह्मणो ब्रूयात् सर्वं कुर्यामिति प्रभो।<br />After his disappearance, I began to follow the vow of uttering certain Mantras silently without being heard by anybody. From that day I resolved to do whatever commands I should receive from the Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='45'>एतद् व्रतमहं कृत्वा मात्रा ते सह पुत्रक॥ ततः परमहष्टात्मा प्राविशं गृहमेव च।<br />Having adopted this vow, O son, along with your mother, both of us, with hearts filled with joy re-entered our palace.</p>
<p id='46'>प्रविष्टमात्रश्च गृहे सर्वं पश्यामि तनवम्॥ यद् भिन्नं यच्च वै दग्धं तेन विप्रेण पुत्रका<br />Entering our house I saw that everything which the Rishi had broken or burnt had reappeared fresh.</p>
<p id='47'>ततोऽहं विस्मयं प्राप्तः सर्वे दृष्ट्वा नवं दृढम्॥ अपूजयं च मनसा रौक्मिणेय सदा द्विजान्।<br />Seeing those new articles, which had besides become more durable, I became stricken with wonder. O son of Rukmini, from that day forth I have always adored the Brahmanas in my mind.</p>
<p id='48'>इत्यहं रौक्मिणेयस्य पृच्छतो भरतर्षभ॥ माहात्म्यं द्विजमुख्यस्य सर्वमाख्यातवांस्तदा।<br />This, O chief of Bharata's race, is what I said on that occasion about the greatness of those Brahmanas who are the foremost of their order.</p>
<p id='49'>तथा त्वमपि कौन्तेय ब्राह्मणान् सततं प्रभो॥ पूजयस्व महाभागान् वाग्भिर्दानैश्च नित्यदा।<br />Do you also, O son of Kunti, adore the highly blessed Brahmanas every day with gifts of wealth and kind, O powerful one.</p>
<p id='50'>एवं व्युष्टिमहं प्राप्तो ब्राह्मणस्य प्रसादजाम्। यच्च मामाह भीष्मोऽयं तत्सत्यं भरतर्षभ॥<br />It was thus that I won the prosperity I enjoy, the prosperity that is born of the favour of Brahmanas. Whatever, again, Bhishma has said of me, O chief of the Bharatas, is all true.</p>
