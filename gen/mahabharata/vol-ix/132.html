<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 132</h3><h4>The mysteries of duty described by the elephant</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच ततः पद्मप्रतीकाशः पद्मोद्भूतः पितामहः। उवाच वचनं देवान् वासवं च शचीपतिम्॥ अयं महाबलो नागो रसातलचरो बली। तेजस्वी रेणुको नाम महासत्त्वपराक्रमः॥<br />Bhishma said After this, the Grandfather Brahman, sprung from the primeval lotus and resembling the lotus (in agreeableness and fragrance), addressed the celestials headed by Vasava, the husband of Sachi, Yonder sits the powerful Naga who lives in the nether regions Gifted with great strength and energy and with great prowess also, his name is Renuka. He is certainly a great being.</p>
<p id='2'>अतितेजस्विनः सर्वे महावीर्या महागजाः। घरयन्ति महीं कृत्स्नां सशैलवनकाननाम्॥ भवद्भिः समनुज्ञातो रेणुकस्तान् महागजान्। धर्मगुह्यानि सर्वाणि गत्वा पृच्छतु तत्र वै॥ पितामहवचः श्रुत्वा ते देवा रेणुकं तदा। प्रेषयामासुरव्यग्रा यत्र ते धरणीधराः॥<br />Those powerful elephants of great energy and power, who hold the entire Earth with her hills, waters and lakes, should be seen by this Renuka at your request. Let Renuka go to them and ask them about the mysteries of religion or duty! Hearing these words of the Grandfather, the celestials wellpleased, sent (the elephant) Renuka to where those upholders of the world are.</p>
<p id='3'>रेणुका उवाच अनुज्ञातोऽस्मि देवैश्च पितृभिश्च महाबलाः। धर्मगुह्यानि युष्माकं श्रोतुमिच्छामि तत्त्वतः। कथयध्वं महाभागा यद् वस्तत्त्वं मनीषितम्॥<br />Going where those elephants are, Renuka address them, saying, Ye powerful creature have been commanded by the celestials and the departed Manes to question you about the mysteries of religion and duty! I desire to hear you discourse on that subject in detail. Ye highly blessed ones, do ye discourse on the subject as your wisdom may dictate.</p>
<p id='4'>दिग्गजा ऊचुः कार्तिके मासि चाश्लेषा बहुलस्याष्टमी शिवा। तेन नक्षत्रयोगेन यो ददाति गुडौदनम्॥<br />Standing in the eight quarters, the elephants said, On the sacred eighth day of the dark fortnight in the month of Kartika when the constellation Ashlesha is in the ascendant, one should make gifts of treacle and rice.</p>
<p id='5'>इमं मन्त्रं जपञ्छ्राद्धे यताहारो ह्यकोपनः। बलदेवप्रभृतयो ये नागा बलवत्तराः॥ अनन्ता ह्यक्षया नित्यं भोगिनः सुमहाबलाः। तेषां कुलोद्भवा ये च महाभूता भुजङ्गेमाः॥ ते मे बलिं प्रतीच्छन्तु बलतेजोऽभिवृद्धये। यदा नारायणः श्रीमानुज्जहार वसुंधराम्॥ तद् बलं तस्य देवस्य धरामुद्धरतस्तथा। एवमुक्त्वा बलिं तत्र वल्मीके तु निवेदयेत्॥ गजेन्द्रकुसुमाकीर्णं नीलवस्त्रानुलेपनम्।<br />an Renouncing anger, and living on regulated diet, one should make these offerings at a Shraddha, uttering these Mantras, Let Baladeva and other Nagas endued with great strength, let other powerful snakes of huge bodies that are indestructible and eternal and let all the other great snakes that have taken their birth in their family, inake vali offerings to me for the increase of my strength and energy. Indeed, let my strength be as great as that of the blessed Narayana when he raised the submerged Earth. Uttering these Mantras, one should make Bali offerings upon anthill. After sunset, offerings of raw sugar and rice should be made on anthill selected. The anthill should Previously be strewn with Gajendra flowers. Offerings should also be made of blue clothes and fragrant unguents.</p>
<p id='6'>निर्वपेत् तं तु वल्मीके अस्तं याते दिवाकरे॥ एवं तुष्टास्ततः सर्वे अधस्ताद्भारपीडिताः। श्रमं तं नावबुध्यामो धारयन्तो वसुंधराम्॥<br />If offerings are made thus, those, beings that live in the nether regions, carrying the weight of the upper regions upon their heads or shoulders, become well pleased and gratified. As for ourselves, we also do not feel the exertion of upholding the Earth, on account of such offerings beings made to us.</p>
<p id='7'>एवं मन्यामहे सर्वे भारार्ता निरपेक्षिणः। ब्राह्मणः क्षत्रियो वैश्यः शूद्रो वा यधुपोषितः॥<br />Afflicted with the burthen we bear, this is what we think (beneficial for men), without the slightest selfish end. By observing this rule for full year, fasting on each occasion, Brahmanas Kshatriyas, and Vaishays and Shudras, acquire great merits from such gifts.</p>
<p id='8'>एवं संवत्सरं कृत्वा दानं बहुफलं लभेत्। वल्मीके बलिमादाय तन्नो बहुफलं मतम्॥<br />We think that the making of such Bali offerings on the anthill is really fraught with very superior merits.</p>
<p id='9'>ये च नागा महावीर्यास्त्रिषु लोकेषु कृत्स्नशः। कृतातिथ्या भवेयुस्ते शतं वर्षाणि तत्त्वतः॥<br />a By making such offerings one is considered as doing the duties of hospitality or a hundred years to all the powerful elephants which exist in the three worlds.</p>
<p id='10'>दिग्गजानां च तच्छ्रुत्वा देवता: पितरस्तथा। ऋषयश्च महाभागाः पूजयन्ति स्म रेणुकम्॥<br />Hearing these words of the powerful clephants, the celestials and the departed Manes and the highly blessed Rishis, all spoke highly of Renuka. By making such offerings one is considered as doing the duties of hospitality or a hundred years to all the powerful elephants which exist in the three worlds.</p>
<p id='11'>दिग्गजानां च तच्छ्रुत्वा देवता: पितरस्तथा। ऋषयश्च महाभागाः पूजयन्ति स्म रेणुकम्॥<br />Hearing these words of the powerful clephants, the celestials and the departed Manes and the highly blessed Rishis, all spoke highly of Renuka.</p>
