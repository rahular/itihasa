<p id='3'>ततः स प्राविशत् तूर्णं जन्मवेश्म पितुस्तवा अर्चि पुरुषव्याघ्र सितैर्माल्यैर्यथाविधि॥ अपां कुम्भैः सुपूर्णश्च विन्यस्तैः सर्वतोदिशम्। घृतेन तिन्दुकालातैः सर्षपैश्च महाभुज॥ अस्त्रैश्च विमलैर्व्यस्तैः पावकैश्च समन्ततः। वृद्धाभिश्चापि रामाभिः परिचारार्थमावृतम्॥<br />He then quickly entered the lying in-room in which your father was born.

<p id='10'>यदि स्म धर्मराज्ञा वा भीमसेनेन वा पुनः। त्वया वा पुण्डरीकाक्ष वाक्यमुक्तमिदं भवेत्॥ अजानतीमिपीकेयं जनित्री हन्त्विति प्रभो। अहमेव विनष्टा स्यां नैतदेवंगते भवेत्॥<br />If king Yudhishthira the just, or Bhimasena, or yourself, O lotus-eyes one, had, on that occasion, said, Let the blade of grass destroy the unconscious mother, O powerful one, then I would have been destroyed and this would not have taken place.</p>
