<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 41</h3><h4>The creation of woman and the object thereof. The story of Vipula and Devasharman</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच ततः कदाचिद् देवेन्द्रो दिव्यरूपवपुर्धरः। इदमन्तरमित्येवमभ्यगात् तमथाश्रमम्॥<br />Bhishma said One day the king of the celestials assuming a form of divine beauty, came to the hermitage of the Rishi, thinking that the opportunity he had been expecting had at last come.</p>
<p id='2'>रूपमप्रतिमं कृत्वा लोभनीयं जनाधिप। दर्शनीयतमो भूत्वा प्रविवेश तमाश्रमम्॥<br />Indeed, O king, having assumed a form peerless in beauty and highly tempting to women and highly agreeable to look at, Indra entered the ascetic's asylum.</p>
<p id='3'>स ददर्श तमासीनं विपुलस्य कलेवरम्। निश्चेष्टं स्तब्धनयनं यथा लेख्यगतं तथा॥<br />He beheld the body of Vipula staying in a sitting posture, immovable as a stake and with eyes shorn of vision, like a picture drawn on the canvas.</p>
<p id='4'>रुचिं च रुचिरापाङ्गी पीनश्रोणिपयोधराम्। पद्मपत्रविशालाक्षीं सम्पूर्णेन्दुनिभाननाम्॥<br />And he beheld also Ruchi, seated there, adorned with eyes whose ends were highly beautiful, possessed of full and round hips, and having a deep and swelling bosom. Her eyes were large and expansive like lotus petals and her face was as beautiful and sweet as the full moon.</p>
<p id='5'>सा तमालोक्य सहसा प्रत्युत्थातुमियेष ह। रूपेण विस्मिता कोऽसीत्यथ वक्तुमिवेच्छती॥<br />Seeing Indra come in that guise, the lady wished to rise up and welcome him. Her wonder having been excited at the peerless beauty of form which the person possessed, she very much wished to ask him as to who he was.</p>
<p id='6'>उत्थातुकामा तु सती विष्टब्धा विपुलेन सा। निगृहीता मनुष्येन्द्र न शशाक विचेष्टितुम्॥<br />Although however, she wished to rise up and welcome him, yet her limbs having been restrained by Vipula who was living within her, she failed, O king, to do what she wished. In fact, she was unable, to move from the place where she sat.</p>
<p id='7'>तामाबभाषे देवेन्द्रः साम्ना परमवल्गुना। त्वदर्थमागतं विद्धि देवेन्द्रं मां शुचिस्मिते॥<br />The king of the celestials then addressed her in sweet words uttered with a sweet voice.</p>
<p id='8'>क्लिश् मानमनङ्गेन त्वत्संकल्पभवेन ह। तत् सम्प्राप्तं हि मां सुभु पुरा कालोऽतिवर्तते॥<br />Indeed he said O you of sweet smiles, know that I am Indra, arrived there for your sake! Know, O sweet lady that I am afflicted by the god of love provoked by your thoughts. O you of beautiful brows, I have come to you. Time passes away.</p>
<p id='9'>तमेवंवादिनं शक्रं शुश्राव विपुलो मुनिः। गुरुपल्ल्याः शरीरस्थो ददर्श त्रिदशाधिपम्॥<br />These words that Indra spoke were heard by the ascetic Vipula. Remaining within the body of his preceptor's wife, he saw everything that took place.</p>
<p id='10'>न शशाक च सा राजन् प्रत्युत्थातुमनिन्दिता। वक्तुं च नाशकद् राजन् विष्टब्धा विपुलेन सा॥<br />The lady of faultless beauty, though she heard what Indra said, was, however, unable to rise up for welcoming or honouring the king of the celestials. Her senses restrained by Vipula she could make no reply.</p>
<p id='11'>आकारं गुरुपत्यास्तु स विज्ञाय भृगूद्वहः। निजग्राह महातेजा योगेन बलबत् प्रभो॥<br />Judging from the marks afforded by the body of his preceptor's wife that she was not reluctant to receive Indra with kindness, that scion of Bhrigu's race, of mighty energy restrained her limbs and senses all the more effectually, O king, by his Yogapowers.</p>
<p id='12'>बबन्ध योगबन्धैश्च तस्याः सर्वेन्द्रियाणि सः। तां निर्विकारां दृष्ट्वा तु पुनरेव शचीपतिः॥ उवाच वीडितो राजस्तां योगबलमोहिताम्। एह्येहीति ततः सा तु प्रतिवक्तुमियेष तम्॥<br />With Yogafetters he bound up all her senses. Seeing her seated without any mark of agitation on her body, the husband of Sachi, abashed a little once more addressed that lady who was stupefied by the Yogapowers of her husband's disciple, in these words Come, come, O sweet lady! Then the lady tried to answer him. Vipula however, restrained the words that she intended to utter,</p>
<p id='13'>स तां वाचं गुरोः पत्न्या विपुलः पर्यवर्तयत्। भो: किमागमने कृत्यमिति तस्यास्तु निःसृता॥<br />The words therefore, that actually dropped from her lips were What is the reason of your coming here? These words adorned with grammatical refinements, came out of her mouth that was as beautiful like the moon.</p>
<p id='14'>वक्त्राच्छशाङ्कसदृशाद् वाणी संस्कारभूषणा। वीडिता सा तु तद्वाक्यमुक्त्वा परवशा तदा॥<br />Subject to the influence of another, she gave vent to these words, but became rather ashamed for uttering them. Hearing her, Purandara became highly disspirited.</p>
<p id='15'>पुरन्दरश्च तत्रस्थो बभूव विमना भृशम्। स तद्वैकृतमालक्ष्य देवराजो विशाम्पते॥<br />Observing that awkward result, the king of the celestials, O monarch, having a thousand eyes, saw everything with his spiritual eye.</p>
<p id='16'>अवैक्षत सहस्राक्षस्तदा दिव्येन चक्षुषा। स ददर्श मुनिं तस्याः शरीरान्तरगोचरम्॥<br />He then saw the ascetic living within the body of the lady. Indeed, the ascetic remained within the body of his preceptor's wife like an image or reflection on a mirror.</p>
<p id='17'>प्रतिबिम्बमिवादशे गुरुपल्याः शरीरगम्। स तं घोरेण तपसा युक्तं दृष्ट्वा पुरन्दरः॥<br />Seeing the ascetic gifted with the terrible power of penances, Purandara, O king, fearing the Rishi's curse, trembled in fear.</p>
<p id='18'>प्रावेपत सुसंत्रस्तः शापभीतस्तदा विभो। विमुच्य गुरुपत्नीं तु विपुलः सुमहातपाः। स्वकलेवरमाविश्य शक्रं भीतमथाब्रवीत्॥<br />Vipula then gifted with great ascetic power, left the body of his preceptor's wife and returned to his own body that was lying near. Then he addressed the terrified Indra in the following words.</p>
<p id='19'>विपुल उवाच अजितेन्द्रिय दुर्बुद्धे पापात्मक पुरन्दर। न चिरं पूजयिष्यन्ति देवास्त्वां मानुषास्तथा॥<br />Vipula said O wicked Purandara, O you of sinful mind, o wretch who have no control over your senses, neither the deities nor human beings will worship you for any length of time.</p>
<p id='20'>किं तु तद्विस्मृतं शक न तन्मनसि ते स्थितम्। गौतमेनासि यन्मुक्तो भगाङ्कपरिचिह्नितः॥<br />Have you forgotten it, O Shakra does it not still dwell in your remembrance that Gautama had cursed you on account of which your body became disfigured with a thousand sexmarks, which owing to the Rishi's mercy, were after words changed into so many eyes.</p>
<p id='21'>जाने त्वां बालिशमतिमकृतात्मानमस्थिरम्। मयेयं रक्ष्यते मूढ गच्छ पाप यथागतम्॥<br />I know that you are of an exceedingly foolish understanding that, your soul is impure and that you are of an exceedingly fickle mind. O fool, know that this lady is being protected by me. O sinful wretch, return whence you came.</p>
<p id='22'>नाहं त्वामद्य मूढात्मन् दहेयं हि स्वतेजसा। कृपायमानस्तु न ते दग्धुमिच्छामि वासव॥<br />you of foolish soul, I do not reduce you today into ashes with my energy. Indeed, I am filled with mercy for you. It is for this that I do not, O Vasava, wish to burn you.</p>
<p id='23'>स च घोरतमो धीमान् गुरुस्त्वं पापचेतसम्। दृष्ट्वा त्वां निर्दहेदद्य क्रोधदीप्तेन चक्षुषा॥<br />My preceptor gifted with great intelligence, is possessed of terrible power. With eyes blazing with anger, he would, if he saw you, have burnt your sinful self today.</p>
<p id='24'>नैवं तु शक्र कर्तव्यं पुनर्मान्याच ते द्विजाः। मा गम: ससुतामात्यः क्षयं ब्रह्मबलार्दितः॥<br />You should not, O Shakra, do its like again. The Brahmanas should be respected by you. See that you do not, with your sons and counsellors, meet with destruction, afflicted by the power of the Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='25'>अमरोऽस्मीति यबुद्धि समास्थाय प्रवर्तसे। मावमंस्था न तपसा नसाध्यं नाम किंचन॥<br />You think that you are an immortal and that, therefore, are at liberty to act thus. Do not, however, dishonour the Brahmanas. Know that there is nothing unattainable by penance.</p>
<p id='26'>भीष्म उवाच तच्छुत्वा वचनं शक्रो विपुलस्य महात्मनः। अकिंचिदुक्त्वा व्रीडार्तस्तत्रैवान्तरधीयत॥<br />Bhishma said Hearing these words of the great Vipula, Shakra without saying anything, and covered with shame, disappeared.</p>
<p id='27'>मुहूर्तयाते तस्मिंस्तु देवशर्मा महातपाः। कृत्वा यज्ञं यथाकाममाजगाम स्वमाश्रमम्॥<br />A moment after he had gone away, Devasharman of great ascetic merit, having accomplished the sacrifice, he had intended to perform, returned to his own hermitage.</p>
<p id='28'>आगतेऽथ गुरौ राजन् विपुल: प्रियकर्मकृत्। रक्षितां गुरवे भार्यां न्यवेदयदनिन्दिताम्॥<br />When his preceptor returned, Vipula who had done a good deed, gave to him his wife of faultless beauty whom he had successfully protected against the machination of Indra.</p>
<p id='29'>अभिवाद्य च शान्तात्मा स गुरुं गुरुवत्सलः। विपुलः पर्युपातिष्ठद् यथापूर्वमशङ्कितः॥<br />O tranquil soul and full of respect for his preceptor, Vipula respectfully saluted him and stood before him with a fearless heart.</p>
<p id='30'>विश्रान्ताय ततस्तस्मै सहासीनाय भार्यया। निवेदयामास तदा विपुलः शक्रकर्म तत्॥<br />After his preceptor had rested a while and when he was seated with his wife on the same seat, Vipula told him everything that Shakra had done.</p>
<p id='31'>तच्छुत्वा स मुनिस्तुष्टो विपुलस्य प्रतापवान्। बभूव शीलवृत्ताभ्यां तपसा नियमेन च॥<br />Hearing these words of Vipula, that foremost of Munis, gifted with great prowess, became highly pleased with him for his conduct and disposition, his penances and his observances.</p>
<p id='32'>वियुलस्य गुरौ वृत्तिं भक्तिमात्मनि तत्प्रभुः। धर्म च स्थिरतां दृष्ट्वा साधु साध्वित्यभाषत।॥<br />Observing Vipula's conduct towards himself his preceptor and his devotion also and marking his steadiness in virtue, the powerful Devasharman exclaimed-Excellent, excellent.</p>
<p id='33'>प्रतिलभ्य च धर्मात्मा शिष्यं धर्मपरायणम्। वरेणच्छन्दयामास देवशर्मा महामतिः॥<br />The pious Devasharman receiving his virtuous disciple with a sincere welcome, honoured him with a boon.</p>
<p id='34'>स्थितिं च धर्मे जग्राह स तस्माद् गुरुवत्सलः। अनुज्ञातश्च गुरुणा चचारानुत्तमं तपः॥<br />Indeed, Vipula, steady in virtue, obtained from his preceptor the boon that he would never swerve or fall away from virtue. Dismissed by his preceptor he left his house and practised the most severe austerities.</p>
<p id='35'>तथैव देवशर्मापि सभार्यः स महातपाः। निर्भयो बलवृत्रमाच्चचार विजने वने।॥<br />Devasharman also of severe penances, with his wife, began from that day to live in those solitary woods, perfectly fearless of him who had killed Vala and Vritra.</p>
