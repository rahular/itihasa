<h3>ASHRAMAVASIKA PARVA: Chapter 22</h3><h4>Yudhishthira goes with his party to see the king in the forest</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच एवं ते पुरुषव्याघ्राः पाण्डवा मातृनन्दनाः। स्मरन्तो मातरं वीरा वभूवुर्भृशदुःखिताः॥<br />Those foremost of men, the heroic Pandavas, those delighters of their mother-became greatly stricken with grief.</p>
<p id='2'>राजकार्येषु पुरा व्यासक्ता नित्यशोऽभवन्। ते राजकार्याणि तदा नाकार्षुः सर्वतः पुरे।॥<br />They who had formerly been always engaged in royal offices, did not at that time attend to those deeds at all in their capital.</p>
<p id='3'>प्रविष्टा इव शोकेन नाभ्यनन्दन्त किञ्चन। सम्भाष्यमाणा अपि ते न किञ्चित् प्रत्यपूजयन्॥<br />Stricken with deep sorrow, they could not find pleasure from anything. It any body asked them, they never honored him with an answer.</p>
<p id='4'>ते स्म वीरा दुराधर्षा गाम्भीर्ये सागरोपमाः। शोकोपहतविज्ञाना नष्टसंज्ञा इवाभवन्॥<br />Although those irresistible heroes were grave like the ocean, yet they were now deprived of their knowledge and their very senses by the grief they left.</p>
<p id='5'>अचिन्तयंश्च जननी ततस्ते पाण्डुनन्दनाः। कथं नु वृद्धमिथुनं वहत्यतिकृशा पृथा॥<br />Thinking of their mother, the sons of Pandu became anxious as to how their emaciated mother was serving the old pair.</p>
<p id='6'>कथं च स महीपालो हतपुत्रो निराश्रयः। पल्या सह वसत्येको वने श्वापदसेविते॥<br />How, indeed, is that king; whose sons have all been killed and who is without refuge, living alone, with only his wife, in the forest haunted by beasts of prey?</p>
<p id='7'>सा च देवी महाभागा गान्धारी हतबान्धवा। पतिमन्धं कथं वृद्धमन्वेति विजने वने।॥<br />Alas, how does that highly blessed queen, Gandhari, whose dear ones have all been killed, follow her blind husband in the solitary forest.</p>
<p id='8'>एवं तेषां कथयतामौत्सुक्यमभवत् तदा। गमने चाभवद् बुद्धिधृतराष्ट्रदिदृक्षया॥<br />Such was the anxiety shown by the Pandavas when they talked with one another. They then set their hearts upon beholding the king in his forest asylum.</p>
<p id='9'>सहदेवस्तु राजानं प्रणिपत्येदमब्रवीत्। अहो मे भवतो दृष्टं हृदयं गमनं प्रति॥<br />Then bowing down to the king, Sahadeva said, “I think you wish to see our sire.</p>
<p id='10'>न हि त्वां गौरवेणाहमशकं वक्तुमञ्जसा। गमनं प्रति राजेन्द्र तदिदं समुपस्थितम्॥<br />From my respect for you, however, I could not speedily speak on the subject of our journey to the forest. The time for that sojourn in now come.</p>
<p id='11'>दिष्ट्या द्रक्ष्यामि तां कुन्ती वर्तयन्ती तपस्विनीम्। जटिलां तापसी वृद्धां कुशकाशपरिक्षताम्॥<br />By good luck I shall see Kunti performing penances, with matted locks on her head, practising severe austerities, and emaciated by sleeping on blades of Kusha and Kasha.</p>

<p id='13'>अनित्याः खलु मर्त्यानां गतयो भरतर्षभ। कुन्ती राजसुता यत्र वसत्यसुखिता वने॥<br />Forsooth, O chief of Bharata's race, the ends of men are exceedingly uncertain, since Kunti, who is a princess by birth, is now living in misery in the forest.'</p>
<p id='14'>सहदेववचः श्रुत्वा द्रौपदी योषितां वरा। उवाच देवी राजानमभिपूज्याभिनन्द्य च॥<br />Hearing these words of Sahadeva, queen Draupadi, that foremost of all women duly honoring the king, said, with proper salutations,</p>
<p id='15'>कदा द्रक्ष्यामि नां देवीं यदि जीवति सा पृथा। जीवन्त्या ह्यद्य मे प्रीतिर्भविष्यति जनाधिप॥<br />Alas, when shall I see queen Pritha, if, indeed, she is alive! I shall consider my life as not passed in vain if I succeed in seeing her once more, O king.</p>
<p id='16'>एषा तेऽस्तु मतिर्नित्यं धर्मे ते रमतां मनः। योऽद्यत्वमस्मान् राजेन्द्र श्रेयसा योजयिष्यसि॥<br />Let this sort of understanding be ever firm in you. Let your mind always take a pleasure in such virtue as is involved, O king of kings, in your desire of granting such a high boon on us.</p>
