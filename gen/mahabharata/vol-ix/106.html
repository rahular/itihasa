<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 106</h3><h4>Ordinances equivalent to sacrifices for poor men</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच सर्वेषामेव वर्णानां म्लेच्छानां च पितामह। उपवासे मतिरियं कारणं च न विद्यते॥<br />Yudhishthira said O grandfather, all the orders of men, including the very Mlechchhas, are naturally disposed to observe fasts. We, however, do not know the reason thereof.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>ब्रह्मक्षत्रेण नियमाश्चर्तव्या इति नः श्रुतम्। उपवासे कथं तेषां कृत्यमस्ति पितामह॥<br />We have heard that only Brahmanas and Kshatriyas should observe the vow of fasts. How, O grandfather, are the other castes to be taken as acquiring any merit by the observance of fasts?</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>नियमांश्चोपवासांश्च सर्वेषा ब्रूहि पार्थिव। आप्नोति कां गतिं तात उपवासपरायणः॥<br />How have vows and fasts come to be observed by persons of all castes, O king? What is that end which one devoted to the observance of fasts, acquires?</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>उपवासः परं पुण्यमुपवासः परायणम्। उपोष्येह नरश्रेष्ठ किं फलं प्रतिपद्यते॥<br />It has been said that fasts are greatly meritorious and that fasts are a great refuge. O king, what is the fruit that is acquired in this world by the man who observes fasts?</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>अधर्मान्मुच्यते केन धर्ममाप्नोति वा कथम्। स्वर्गे पुण्यं च लभते कथं भरतसत्तम॥<br />By what means is one purged of his sins? By what means does one acquire virtue. By what means, O best of the Bharatas, does one succeed in acquiring Heaven and merit.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>उपोष्य चापि किं तेन प्रदेय स्यानराधिप। धर्मेण च सुखार्थोल्लभेद् येन ब्रबीहि तम्॥<br />After having observed a fast, what should one give away, O king? O tell me, what those duties are by which one may succeed in acquiring objects leading to happiness.</p>

<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>भीष्म उवाच इदं खलु मया राजन् श्रुतमासीत् पुरातनम्। उपवासविधौ श्रेष्ठा गुणा ये भरतर्षभ॥<br />Bhishma said Formerly, O king, I heard of these high merits O chief of Bharata's race, as belonging to the observance of fasts according to the ordinance.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>ऋषिमङ्गिरसं पूर्वं पृष्टवानस्मि भारत। यथा मां त्वं तथैवाहं पृष्टवांस्तं तपोधनम्॥<br />I had, O Bharata, asked the Rishi Angirasa of great ascetic merit, the very same questions which you have asked me today.</p>

Indeed, O king, a fast for one night, for two nights, and for three nights may be observed by them.</p>
