<p id='2'>कार्तवीर्यार्जुनो नाम राजा बाहुसहस्रवान्। येन सागरपर्यन्ता धनुषा निर्जिता मही॥<br />There was a king named Kartavirya-Arjuna who had a thousand arms. He conquered, with his bow, the Earth extending to the ocean.</p>
<p id='3'>स कदाचित् समुद्रान्ते विचरन् बलदर्पितः। अवाकिरशरशतैः समुद्रमिति नः श्रुतम्॥<br />We have heard that, once on a time, as he was walking on the shores of the sea, proud of his power, he showered hundreds of arrows on thal vast receptacle of water.</p>
<p id='4'>तं समुद्रो नमस्कृत्य कृताञ्जलिरुवाच हा मा मुञ्च वीर नाराचान् ब्रूहि किं करवाणि ते॥<br />The Ocean, bowing down to him, said, with joined hands, Do not, O hero. discharged your arrows (at me)! Say, what shall I do to you.</p>
<p id='5'>मदाश्रयाणि भूतानि त्वद्विसृष्टैर्महेषुभिः। वध्यन्ते राजशार्दूल तेभ्यो देह्यभयं विभो॥<br />With these strong arrows shot by you, those creatures which have taken shelter in me are being killed, O foremost of kings! Do you, O lord, grant them security.</p>
<p id='6'>अर्जुन उवाच मत्समो यदि संग्रामे शरासनधरः क्वचित्। विद्यते तं समाचक्ष्व यः समासीत मां मृधे॥<br />If any holder of the bow exists that is equal to me in battle, and that would stand against mc in the field, do you name him to me.</p>
<p id='7'>समुद्र उवाच महर्षिर्जमदग्निस्ते यदि राजन् परिश्रुतः। तस्य पुत्रस्तवातिथ्यं यथावत् कर्तुमर्हति।॥<br />The Ocean said If you have heard, O king, of the great Rishi Jamadagni, his son is competent to duly receive you as a guest.</p>
<p id='8'>ततः स राजा प्रययौ क्रोधेन महता वृतः। स तमाश्रममागम्य राममेवान्वपद्यत॥<br />Then that king proceeded, becoming highly irate. Arrived at that hermitage, he found Rama himself.</p>
<p id='9'>स रामप्रतिकूलानि चकार सह बन्धुभिः। आयासं जनयामास रामस्य च महात्मनः॥<br />With his kinsmen he began to do many deeds while were hostile to Rama, and caused much trouble to that grcat hero.</p>
<p id='10'>ततस्तेजः प्रजज्वाल रामस्यामिततेजसः। प्रदहन् रिपुसैन्यानि तदा कमललोचने।॥<br />Then the energy, which was immeasurable, of Rama shone forth, burning the troops of the enemy, O lotus-eyed one.</p>
<p id='11'>ततः परशुमादाय स तं बाहुसहस्रिणम्। चिच्छेद सहसा रामो बहुशाखमिव दुमम्॥<br />Taking up his battle-axe, Rama suddenly displayed his power, and hacked that thousandarmed hero, like a tree of many branches.</p>
<p id='12'>तं हतं पतितं दृष्ट्वा समेताः सर्वबान्धवाः। असीनादाय शक्तीश्च भार्गवं पर्यधावयन्॥<br />Seeing him killed and laid low on the earth, all his kinsmen, collected in a body, and taking up their darts rushed at Rama, who was then scated, from all sides.</p>
<p id='13'>रामोऽपि धनुरादाय रथमारुह्य सत्वरः। विसृजशरवर्षाणि व्यधमत् पार्थिवं बलम्॥<br />Rama also, taking up his bow and quickly getting on his car, discharged showers of arrows and punished the army of the king.</p>
<p id='14'>ततस्तु क्षत्रियाः केचिज्जामदग्न्यभयार्दिताः। विविशुर्गिरिदुर्गाणि मृगाः सिंहार्दिता इव॥<br />Then, some of the Kshatriyas, stricken with the terror of Jamadagni's son, entered mountain fastnesses, like deer afflicted by the lion.</p>
<p id='15'>तेषां स्वविहितं कर्म तद्भयान्नानुतिष्ठताम्। प्रजा वृषलता प्राप्ता ब्राह्मणानामदर्शनात्॥<br />Of them that were unable, through feat of Rama, lo perform the duties ordained for their order, the progeny became Vrishalas owing to their inability to find Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='16'>एवं ते द्रविडाऽऽभीरा: पुण्ड्राश्च शबरैः सह। वृषलत्वं परिगता व्युत्थानात् क्षत्रधर्मिणः॥<br />Thus the Dravidas and Adhiras and Pundars together with the Shavaras, became Vrishalas through those men who had Kshatriya duties assigned to them, following away (from them).</p>
<p id='17'>ततश्च हतवीरासु क्षत्रियासु पुनः पुनः। द्विजैरुत्पादितं क्षत्रं जामदग्न्यो न्यकृन्तत॥<br />Then the Kshatriyas that were begotten by the Brahmanas upon Kshatriya women who had lost their heroic children, were repeatedly destroyed by Jamadagni's son.</p>
<p id='18'>एकविंशतिमेधान्ते रामं वागशरीरिणी। दिव्या प्रोवाच मधुरा सर्वलोकपरिश्रुता॥ राम राम निवर्तस्व के गुणं तात पश्यसि। क्षत्रबधूनिमान् प्राणैर्विप्रयोज्य पुनः पुनः॥<br />The destruction proceeded one and twenty times. At its conclusion a bodiless voice, sweet and coming from the celestial region, and which was heard by all people, spoke to Rama, O Rama, O Rama, stop! What merit do you see, O son, in thus destroying repeatedly these inferior Kshatriyas?</p>
<p id='19'>तथैव तं महात्मानमृचीकप्रमुखास्तदा। पितामहा महाभाग निवर्तस्वेत्यथाब्रुवन्॥<br />Thus, O blessed dame, his grandsires, headed by Richika, addressed that great one, saying, Do you, desist.</p>
<p id='20'>पितुर्वधममृष्यंस्तु रामः प्रोवाच तानृषीन्। नार्हन्तीह भवन्तो मां निवारयितुमित्युत॥<br />Rama, however, unable to forgive the destruction of his father, replied to those Rishis, saying, you should not forbid me.</p>
<p id='21'>पितर ऊचुः नार्हसे क्षत्रबन्धुंस्त्वं निहन्तुं जयतां वरा नेह युक्तं त्वया हन्तुं ब्राह्मणेन सता नृपान्॥<br />The departed manes then said, O foremost of all victorious men, you should not kill these inferior Kshatriyas! It is not proper that your self, being a Brahmanas should kill these kings.</p>
