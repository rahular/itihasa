She then brought oil and a piece of cloth for his wear during the ablutions.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>अनुज्ञाता च मुनिना सा स्त्री तेन महात्मना। अथास्य तैलेनाङ्गानि सर्वाण्येवाभ्यमृक्षत॥<br />With the ascetic's permission she rubbed every part of his body with the fragrant oil she had brought for him.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>शनैश्चोत्सादितस्तत्र स्नानशालामुपागमत्। भद्रासन ततश्चित्रमृषिरन्वगमन्नवम्॥<br />The Rishi was rubbed, and when the process of rubbing was over, he went to the room set apart set apart for the performance of ablutions. There he sat upon a new and Excellent seat.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>अथोपविष्टश्च यदा तस्मिन् भद्रासने तदा। स्नापयामास शनकैस्तमृषि सुखहस्तवत्॥<br />After the Rishi had taken his seat upon it, the old lady began to wash his body with her own soft hands whose touch was highly agrecable.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>दिव्यं च विधिवच्चक्रे सोपचारं मुनेस्तदा। स तेन सुसुखोष्णेन तस्या हस्तसुखेन च॥ व्यतीतां रजनी कृत्स्ना नाजानात् स महाव्रतः। तत उत्थाय स मुनिस्तदा परमविस्मितः॥<br />One after another in due course the lady helped the Rishi in his ablutions. Between the lukewarm water with which he was washed, and the soft hands which were engaged in washing him, the Rishi of rigid vows could not understand that the whole night had passed away in the work. Rising from the bath, the Rishi became highly surprised.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>पूर्वस्यां दिशि सूर्ये च सोऽपश्यदुदितं दिवि। तस्य बुद्धिरयं किं नु मोहस्तत्त्वमिदं भवेत्॥<br />He saw the Sun risen above the horizon on the East. He was surprised at this and asked himself Was it really so or was it a mistake of the understanding.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>अथोपास्य सहस्रांशुं किं करोमीत्युवाच ताम्। सा चामृतरसप्रख्यं ऋषेरन्नमुपाहरत्॥<br />The Rishi then duly adored the god of a thousand rays. This done, he asked the lady as to what he should do. The old lady prepared some food for the Rishi sweet to the taste like ambrosia itself.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>तस्य स्वादुतयानस्य न प्रभूतं चकार सः। व्यगमच्चाप्यहःशेषं ततः संध्यागमत् पुनः॥<br />On account of the sweetness of that food the Rishi could not take much. In taking that little however, the day passed away and evening set in.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>अथ सा स्त्री भगवन्तं सुप्यतामित्यचोदयत्। तत्र वै शयने दिव्ये तस्य तस्याश्च कल्पिते॥<br />The old lady then asked the Rishi to go to bed and sleep. An excellent bed was given ts) the Rishi and another was taken by herself.</p>

Leave my bed, O good lady. Blessed be you do, you desist from this of your own accord.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>भीष्म उवाच सा तदा तेन विप्रेण तथा तेन निवर्तिता। स्वतन्त्रास्मीत्युवाचर्षिः न धर्मच्छलमस्ति ते॥<br />Bhishma said Thus dissuaded by the Brahmana with the help of his selfcontrol, the lady answered him saying I am my own mistress! In accepting me you will commit no sin.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>अष्टवक्र उवाच नास्ति स्वतन्त्रता स्त्रीणामस्वतन्त्रा हि योषितः। प्रजापतिमतं ह्येतन्न स्त्री स्वातन्त्र्यमर्हति॥<br />Ashtavakra said Women can never be their own mistresses. This is the opinion of the Creator himself, viz., that a woman should never be indepent.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>स्त्र्युरुवाच बाधते मैथुनं विप्र मम भक्तिं च पश्य वै। अधर्मे प्राप्स्यसे विप्र यन्मां त्वं नाभिनन्दसि॥<br />The lady said O learned Brahmana, I am pained by desire. Mark my devotion to you. You commit sin by refusing to accept me lovingly.</p>

As for myself I am able to govern my inclinations by selfcontrol. O good lady, return to your own bed.</p>

<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>न दोषो भविता चैव सत्येनैतद् ब्रवीम्यहम्। स्वतन्त्रां मां विजानीहि योऽधर्मः सोऽस्तु वै मयि। त्वय्यावेशितचित्ता च स्वतन्त्रास्मि भजस्व माम्॥<br />You will incur no sin. I tell you truly. Know that I am my own mistress. It there be any sin in this, let it visit me only. My heart is devoted to you. I am my own mistress. Do you accept me.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>अष्टवक्र उवाच स्वतन्त्रा त्वं कथं भद्रे बूहि कारणमत्र वै। नास्ति त्रिलोके स्त्री काचिद् या वै स्वातन्त्र्यमर्हति॥<br />Ashtavakra said How is it, O good lady that you are your own mistress? Tell me the reason of this. There is not a single woman in the three worlds who can be considered as the mistress of her own self.</p>

The husband protects her while she is young. Sons protect her when she is aged. Woman can never be independent as long as they live.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>स्व्युरुवाच कौमारं ब्रह्मचर्ये मे कन्यैवास्मि न संशयः। पत्नी कुरुष्व मां विप्र श्रद्धां विजहि मा मम॥<br />The lady said I have, since my maidenhood adopted the vow of celibacy. Do not doubt it. I am still a maid. Do you make me your wife. O Brahmana, do not kill this devotion of mine to you.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>अष्टवक्र उवाच यथा मम तथा तुभ्यं यथा तुभ्यं तथा मम। जिज्ञासेयमषेस्तस्य विघ्नः सत्यं न किं भवेत्॥<br />Ashtavakra said As you are inclined to me so am I inclined to you. There is this question, however, that should be settled. It is true that by giving way to iny inclinations I shall not be considered as acting contrary to what the Rishi (Vadanya) wishes.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>आश्चर्ये परमं हीदं किं नु श्रेयो हि मे भवेत्। दिव्याभरणवस्त्रा हि कन्येयं मामुपस्थिता॥<br />This is very wonderful. Will this lead to what is good? Here is a maiden adorned with good ornaments and robes!</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>किं त्वस्याः परमं रूपं जीर्णमासीत् कथं पुनः। कन्यारूपमिहाद्यैवं किमिवात्रोत्तरं भवेत्॥<br />She is highly beautiful. Why did decrepitude hide her beauty so long? At present she looks like a beautiful maiden. I do not know what forin she may assume hereafter.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>यथा परं शक्तिधृतेर्न व्युत्थास्ये कथंचन। न रोचते हि व्युत्थानं सत्येनासादयाम्यहम्॥<br />I shall never Swerve from that control which I have over desire and the other passions or from contentment with what I have already gol. Such swerving is not good. I shall keep myself united with truth.</p>
