<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 60</h3><h4>The preference of gift one who solicits and to one who does not</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच यौ च स्यातां चरणेनोपपन्नौ यौ विद्यया सदृशौ जन्मना चा मयाचमानाय च याचते च॥।॥<br />Yudhishthira said To which of two Brahmanas, when both happen to be equally pure in conduct, equally, gifted with learning and purity, of birth and blood, but differing from each other in only this, viz., the one solicits and the other does not-I ask O grandfather, would a gift be more meritorious?</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच श्रेयो वै याचतः पार्थ दानमाहुरयाचते। अर्हत्तमो वै धृतिमान् कृपणादधृतात्मनः॥<br />Bhishma said It has been said, O son of Pritha, that a gift made to an unsoliciting person yields greater merit than one made to a person who begs. One endued with contentment is certainly more deserving than that person who is shorn of that virtue and is, therefore, helpless amidst the storms and buffets of the world.</p>
<p id='3'>क्षत्रियो रक्षणधृतिर्ब्राह्मणोऽनर्थनाधृतिः। ब्राह्मणो धृतिमान् विद्वान् देवान् प्रीणाति तुष्टिमान्॥३<br />The firmness of a Kshatriya consists in the protection he gives to others. The firmness of a Brahmana consists in his refusal to beg. The Brahmana endued with steadiness and learning and contentment gladdens the celestials.</p>
<p id='4'>याच्यमाहुरनीशस्य अभिहारं च भारत। उद्वेजयन्ति याचन्ति सदा भूतानि दस्युवत्॥<br />The wise have said that an act of begging on the part of a poor man is a great reproach. Thosc persons who solicit others are said to annoy the world like thieves and robbers.</p>
<p id='5'>प्रियते याचमानो वै न जातु म्रियते ददत्। ददत् संजीवयत्येनमात्मानं च युधिष्ठिर॥<br />The person who solicits is said to meet with death. The giver, however, is said not to meet with death. The giver is said to give life to him who solicits. By an act of gift, O Yudhishthira, the giver is said to rescue his own self also.</p>
<p id='6'>आनृशंस्यं परो धर्मो याचते यत् प्रदीयते। अयाचतः सीदमानान् सर्वोपायैर्निमन्त्रयेत्॥<br />Mercy is a very high virtue. Led by niercy people make gifts to those who solicit. Those, however, who do not beg but are sunk into poverty and distress, should be respectfully invited for receiving help.</p>
<p id='7'>यदि वै तादृशा राष्ट्रान् वसेयुस्ते द्विजोत्तमाः। भस्मच्छन्नानिवाग्नीस्तान् बुध्येथास्त्वं प्रयत्नतः॥<br />If such Brahmanas, who must be considered as the foremost of their order, live in your kingdom, you should consider them as fire covered with ashes.</p>
<p id='8'>तपसा दीप्यमानास्ते दहेयुः पृथिवीमपि। अपूज्यमानाः कौरव्य पूजार्हास्तु तथाविधाः॥<br />Burning with penances, they are capable of consuming the whole Earth. Such persons, O son of Kuru's race though not generally adored, should still he considered as worthy of adoration in every way.</p>
<p id='9'>पूज्या हि ज्ञानविज्ञानतपोयोगसमन्विताः। तेभ्यः पूजां प्रयुञ्जीथा ब्राह्मणेभ्यः परंतप॥<br />Gifted with knowledge and spiritual vision and penances and Yoga, such persons always deserve our adoration. O scorcher of enemies, do you always offer adoration to such Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='10'>ददद् बहुविधान् दायानुपागच्छन्नयाचताम्। यदग्निहोत्रे सुहुते सायंप्रातर्भवेत् फलम्॥<br />One should go of his own accord to those foremost of Brahmanas who do not solicit any body and make gifts to them of various kinds of wealth in abundance. The merit that comes from properly pouring libations on the sacred fire every morning and evening, is acquired by are the person who makes gifts to a Brahmana endowed with learning, with the Vedas, and with high and excellent vows.</p>
<p id='11'>विद्यावेदव्रतवति तद्दानफलमुच्यते। विद्यावेदव्रतस्नातानव्यापाश्रयजीविनः॥ गूढस्वाध्यायतपसो ब्राह्मणान् संशितव्रतान्। कृतैरावसथैर्हद्यैः सप्रेष्यैः सपरिच्छदैः॥<br />You should, O son of Kunti, invite those foremost of Brahmanas, who are cleansed by learning and the Vedas and vows, who live, in independence, whose Vedic studies and penances concealed without being announced from the house top, and who observe excellent vows, and honour them with gifts of well-built and charming houses containing servitors and robes and furniture, and all other articles of pleasure and enjoyment.</p>
<p id='12'>निमन्त्रयेथाः कौरव्य कामैश्चान्येर्द्विजोत्तमान्। अपि ते प्रतिगृह्वीयुः श्रद्धोपेतं युधिष्ठिर॥<br />Knowing all duties and possessed of minute vision, those foremost of Brahmanas, O Yudhishthira, may accept the gifts offered to them with devotion and respect, thinking, that they should not refuse and disappoint the giver.</p>
<p id='13'>कार्यमित्येव मन्वाना धर्मज्ञाः सूक्ष्मदर्शिनः। अपि ते ब्राह्मणा भुक्त्वा गताः सोद्धरणान् गृहान्।।<br />You should invite those Brahmanas whose wives wait for their return like tillers in expectation of rain. Having fed them well, you should present additional food to them so that upon their return home their expectant wives might be able to distribute that food among their children who had clamoured for food but who had been consoled with promises.</p>
<p id='14'>येषां दाराः प्रतीक्षन्ते पर्जन्यमिव कर्षकाः। अन्नानि प्रातःसवने नियता ब्रह्मचारिणः॥<br />Brahmacharins of controlled senses, O son, by eating at one's house in the forenoon, cause the three sacrificial fires to be pleased with the householder at whose house they eat.</p>
<p id='15'>ब्राह्मणास्तात भुञ्जनास्त्रेताग्निं प्रीणयन्त्युत। माध्यन्दिनं ते सवनं ददतस्तात वर्तताम्॥ ।<br />Let the sacrifice of gift proceed in your house at midday, O son, and do you also distribute kine and gold and dresses. By acting thus, you are sure to please the king of the celestials himself.</p>
<p id='16'>गोहिरण्यानि वासांसि तेनेन्द्रः प्रीयतां तव। तृतीयं सवनं ते वै वैश्वदेवं युधिष्ठिर॥<br />That would constitute your third sacrifice, O Yudhishthira, in which offerings are made to the deities, the Departed Manes and the Brahmanas. By such sacrifice you are sure to please the Vishvedevas.</p>
<p id='17'>यद् देवेभ्यः पितृभ्यश्च विप्रेभ्यश्च प्रयच्छसि। अहिंसा सर्वभूतेभ्यः संविभागश्च भागशः॥<br />Let mercy to all creatures, giving to all creatures what is due to them, controlling the senses, renunciation, firmness, and truth, form the final bath of that sacrifice which is formed by gift.</p>
<p id='18'>दमस्त्यागो धृतिः सत्यं भवत्यवभृथायते। एष ते विततो यज्ञः श्रद्धापूतः सदक्षिणः॥<br />This is the sacrifice that is spread out for you-a sacrifice which is sanctified by devotion and faith, and who has a large sacrificial gift attached to it. This sacrifice which is formed by gift is superior to all other sacrifices. O son, let this sacrifice be always celebrated by you.</p>
