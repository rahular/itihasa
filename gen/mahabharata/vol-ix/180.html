<h3>ASHVAMEDHIKA PARVA: Chapter 12</h3><h4>Mental and Physical Discases as described by Krishna</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>वासुदेव उवाच द्विविधे जायते व्याधिः शारीरो मानसस्तथा। परस्परं तयोर्जन्म निर्द्वन्द्वं नोपपद्यते।।।।<br />There are two kinds of diseases, physical and mental. They are produced by the mutua? action of the body and mind on cach other, and they never originate without the interaction of the two.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>शरीरे जायते व्याधिः शारीरः स निगद्यते। मानसे जायते व्याधिर्मानसस्तु निगद्यते॥<br />The disease that is produced in the body, is called physical, and that which is produced in the mind, is called mental.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>शीतोष्णे चैव वायुश्च गुणा राजन् शरीरजाः। तेषां गुणानां साम्यं चेत् तदाहुः स्वस्थलक्षणम्॥<br />The cold, the warin (phlegm and bile) as well as the windy humours, O king, are the essential changes created in the physical body, and when these humours are equally distributed, and are present in due proportions, they indicate good health.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>उष्णेन बाध्यते शीतं शीतेनोष्णं च बाध्यते। सत्त्वं रजस्तमश्चेति त्रय आत्मगुणाः स्मृताः॥ तेषां गुणानां साम्यं चेत् तदाहुः स्वस्थलक्षणम्। तेषामन्यतमोत्सेके विधानमुपदिश्यते॥<br />The warm humour is influenced by the cold. and the cold by the warm. Goodness, Darkness and Ignorance are the attributes of the soul, and it is said by the learned, that their presence in equal parts, indicates health (of the mind). But if any of the three preponderate, some remedy is laid down.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>हर्षेण बाध्यते शोको हर्षः शोकेन बाध्यते। कश्चिद् दुःखे वर्तमानः सुखस्य स्मर्तुमिच्छति। कश्चित् सुखे वर्तमानो दुःखस्य स्मर्तुमिच्छति॥<br />Happiness is overcome by sorrow, and sorrow by pleasure. Some people while afflicted by sorrow, wish to recall (past) happiness, while others, while in the enjoyment of happiness, wish to recall past sorrow.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>स त्वं न दुःखी दुःखस्य न सुखी सुसुखस्य च। स्मर्तुमिच्छसि कौन्तेय किमन्यद् दुःखविभ्रमात्॥ अथवा ते स्वभावोऽयं येन पार्थावकृष्यसे। दृष्ट्वा सभागतां कृष्णामेकवस्त्रां रजस्वलाम्। मिषतां पाण्डवेयानां न तस्य स्मर्तुमिच्छसि॥ प्रव्राजनं च नगरादजिनैश्च विवासनम्। महारण्यनिवासश्च न तस्य स्मर्तुमिच्छसि॥ जटासुरात् परिक्लेशश्चित्रसेनेन चाहवः। सैन्धवाच्च परिक्लेशो न तस्य स्मर्तुमिच्छसि॥<br />But you, O son of Kunti, do nether wish to recall your sorrows nor your happiness, what else do you wish to recall barring this delusion of sorrow. Or, perchance, O son of Pritha, it is your innate nature, by which you are at present overpowered. You do not wish to recall to your mind the painful spectacle of Krishna standing in the hall of assembly with only one piece of cloth to cover her body, and while she was in her menses and before all the Pandavas. And it is not proper that you should brood over your departure from the city, and your exile with the hide of the antelope for your dress, and your wanderings in the great forest, nor should you recall to your mind the affliction from Jatasura, the fight with Chitrasena, and your troubles from the Saindhavas.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>पुनरज्ञातचर्यायां कीचकेन पदा वधः। याज्ञसेन्यास्तथा पार्थ न तस्य स्मर्तुमिच्छसि॥ यच्च ते द्रोणभीष्माभ्यां युद्धमासीदरिंदम। मनसैकेन योद्धव्यं तत् ते युद्धमुपस्थितम्॥<br />Nor it is meet, O son of Pritha, and conqueror of your foes, that you should recall the incident of Kichaka's kicking Draupadi, during the period of your exile passed in absolute concealment, nor the incidents of the fight which took place between yourself and Drona and Bhishma. The time has now arrived, when you must fight which each must do single-handed with his mind.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>तस्मादभ्युपगन्तव्यं युद्धाय भरतर्षभ परमव्यक्तरूपस्य पारं युक्त्या स्वकर्मभिः॥<br />Therefore, O chief of Bharata's race, you must now prepare to carry the struggle against your mind, and by dint of abstraction and the merit of your own Karma, you must reach the other side of the mysterious and unintelligible (mind).</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>यत्र नैव शरैः कार्यं न भृत्यैर्न च बन्धुभिः। आत्मनैकेन योद्धव्यं तत् ते युद्धमुपस्थितम्॥<br />In this war there will be no need for any weapons nor for friends nor attendants. The battle which is to be fought alone and singlehanded has now arrived for you.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>तस्मिन्ननिर्जिते युद्धे कामवस्थां गमिष्यसि। एतज्ज्ञात्वा तु कौन्तेय कृतकृत्यो भविष्यसि॥<br />And if defeated in this struggle, you shall find yourself in the most wretched condition, and, O son of Kunti, knowing this, and acting accordingly, shall you attain success.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>एतां बुद्धिं विनिश्चित्य भूतानामागतिं गतिम्। पितृपैतामहे वृत्ते शाधि राज्यं यथोचितम्॥<br />And knowing this wisdom and the destiny of all creatures, and following the conduct of your forefathers do you duly govern your kingdom.</p>
