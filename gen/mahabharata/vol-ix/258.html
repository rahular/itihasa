<p id='3'>तर्पितेषु द्विजाग्येषु ज्ञातिसम्बन्धिबन्धुषु। दीनान्धकृपणे वापि तदा भरतसत्तम॥ घुष्यमाणे महादाने दिक्षु सर्वासु भारत। पतत्सु पुष्पवर्षेषु धर्मराजस्य मूर्धनि॥ नीलाक्षस्तत्र नकुलो रुक्मपार्श्वस्तदानघ। वज्राशनिसमं नादममुञ्चद वसुधाधिप॥<br />On all the foremost of Brahmanas and all the kinsmen and relatives and friends, and all the poor, the blind, and the helpless ones, being gratified, O chief of Bharata's race, when the gifts made in profusion were being spoken of on all sides, indeed, when flowers were rained down on the head of king Yudhishthira the just, a blue-eyed mungoose, O sinless one, with one side of his body converted into gold, came there and spoke a voice that was as loud and deep as thunder.</p>
<p id='4'>सकृदुत्सृज्य तन्नादं त्रासयानो मृगद्विजान्। मानुषं वचनं प्राह धृष्टो विलशयो महान्॥ सक्तुप्रस्थेन वो नायं यज्ञस्तुल्यो नराधिपाः। उच्छवृत्तेर्वदान्यस्य कुरुक्षेत्रनिवासिनः॥<br />Repeatedly uttering such deep sounds and thereby frightening all animals and birds, that proud dweller of a hole, with large body, spoke in a human voice and said, “You kings, this great sacrifice is not equal to a prastha of powdered daily given away by a liberal Brahmana of Kurukshetra who was observing the Unchcha vow.</p>
<p id='5'>तस्य तद् वचनं श्रुत्वा नकुलस्य विशाम्पते। विस्मयं परमं जग्मुः सर्वे ते ब्राह्मणर्षभाः॥<br />Hearing these words of the mongoose, o king, all those foremost of Brahmanas became stricken with wonder.</p>
<p id='6'>ततः समेत्य नकुलं पर्यपृच्छन्त ते द्विजाः। कुतस्त्वं समनुप्राप्तो यज्ञं साधुसमागमम्॥<br />Approaching the mongoose, they then asked him, saying, 'Whence have you come to this sacrifice this resort of the good and the pious?</p>
<p id='7'>किं बलं परमं तुभ्यं किं श्रुतं किं परायणम्। कथं भवन्तं विद्याम यो नो यज्ञं विगर्हसे।।१०<br />What is the extent of your power? What you learning? And what your refuge? How should we know you who thus censure this our sacrifice?</p>

Libations have bcen poured on the sacred fire with the help of proper Mantras. That which should be given, has been given away without pride.</p>

The Kshatriyas have been pleased with battles fought according to just methods. The grandfathers have been pleased with Sharaddhas,</p>
<p id='11'>पालनेन विशस्तुष्टाः कामैस्तुष्टा वरस्त्रियः। अनुक्रोशैस्तथा शूद्रा दानशेषैः पृथग्जनाः॥<br />The Vaishyas have been pleased by the protection offered to them, and many foremost of women have been pleased by accomplishing their desires. The Shudras have been pleased b y kind speeches, and others with the residue of the profuse wealth collected on the spot.</p>
<p id='12'>ज्ञातिसम्बन्धिनस्तुष्टाः शौचेन च नृपस्य नः। देवा हविर्भिः पुण्यैश्च रक्षणैः शरणागताः॥<br />Kinsmen and relatives have been pleased by the purity of conduct shown by our king. The celestials have been pleased by libations of clarified butter and acts of merit, and dependents and followers by protection.</p>
<p id='13'>यदत्र तथ्यं तद् ब्रूहि सत्यं सत्यं द्विजातिषु। यथाश्रुतं यथादृष्टं पृष्टो ब्राह्मणकाम्यया॥<br />That, therefore, which is true, do you truly declare to these Brahmanas. Indeed, do you declare what is according to the scriptures and to actual experience, asked by the Brahmanas who are eager to know.</p>
<p id='14'>श्रद्धेयवाक्यः प्राज्ञस्त्वं दिव्यं रूपं बिभर्षि च। समागतश्च विप्रैस्त्वं तद् भवान् वक्तुमर्हति॥<br />Your words are creditable. You are wise. You have have, also, a celestial form. You have come into the midst of learned Brahmanas. You should explain yourself.'</p>

Neither have I spoken them from pride.</p>
<p id='16'>यन्मयोक्तमिदं वाक्यं युष्माभिश्चाप्युपश्रुतम्। सक्तुप्रस्थेन वो नायं यज्ञस्तुल्यो द्विजर्षभाः॥<br />You have all heard what I have said. You foremost of twice-born persons, this sacrifice is not equal in merit to the gift of a prastha of powdered barley.</p>
<p id='17'>इत्यवश्यं मयैतद् वो वक्तव्यं द्विजसत्तमाः। शृणुताव्यग्रमनसः शंसतो मे यथातथम्॥<br />Forsooth, I should say this, O focmost of Brahmanas. Listen to me with rapt attention as I truly describe to you what took place.</p>
<p id='18'>अनुभूतं च दृष्टं च यन्मयादुतमुत्तमम्। उच्छवृत्तेर्वदान्यस्य कुरुक्षेत्रनिवासिनः॥<br />Wonderful and excellent was the event that happened. It was seen by me and its consequences were felt by me. The incident relates to a liberal Brahmana living in Kurukshetra in the observance of the Unchcha VOW.</p>
<p id='19'>स्वर्ग येन द्विजाः प्राप्तः सभार्यः ससुतस्नुषः। यथा चाघ शरीरस्य ममेदं काञ्चनीकृतम्॥<br />On account of that incident he attained to Heaven, O twice-born ones, along with his wife and son and daughter-in-law. And in consequence of what then took place half my body became changed into gold.</p>
<p id='20'>नकुल उवाच हन्त वो वर्तयिष्यामि दानस्य फलमुत्तमम्। न्यायलब्धस्य सूक्ष्मस्य विप्रदत्तस्य यद् द्विजाः॥<br />The Mungoose continued : O twice-born ones, I shall presently tell you what the excellent fruit was of the gift, made by a Brahmana, of a very little measure (of powdered barley) acquired by fair means.</p>
<p id='21'>धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे धर्मज्ञैर्बहुभिर्वृते। उच्छवृत्तिर्द्विजः कश्चित् कापोतिरभवत् तदा॥<br />On that righteous spot of ground known by the name of Kurukshetra, which is the habitation of many righteous persons, there lived a Brahmana observing the Unchcha vow. That mode of living is like that of the pigeon.</p>
<p id='22'>सभार्यः सह पुत्रेण सस्नुषस्तपसि स्थितः। बभूव शुक्वृत्तः स धर्मात्मा नियतेन्द्रियः॥<br />He lived there with his wife and son and daughter-in-law and practiced penances. Of righteous soul and with senses completely controlled, he adopted the mode of living which is followed by a parrot.</p>
<p id='23'>षष्ठे काले सदा विप्रो भुडन्तै तैः सह सुव्रतः। षष्ठे काले कदाचित् तु तस्याहारो न विद्यते॥ भुक्तेऽन्यस्मिन् कदाचित् स षष्ठे काले द्विजोत्तमः। कदाचिद् धर्मिणस्तस्य दुर्भिक्षे सति दारुणे॥ नाविद्यत तदा विप्राः संचयस्तन्निबोधता क्षीणौषधिसमावेशे द्रव्यहीनोऽभवत् तदा॥<br />Of excellent vows, he used to cat every day at the sixth division. If there was nothing to eat at the sixth division of the day, that excellent Brahmana would fast for that day and eat the next day at the sixth division. On one occasion, you Brahmanas, there took place a dreadful famine in the land. During that time there was nothing stored in the abode of that righteous Brahmana. The herbs and plants were all dried up and the whole kingdom became void of food-stores.</p>
<p id='24'>काले कालेऽस्य सम्प्राप्ते नैव विद्येत भोजनम्। क्षुधापरिगताः सर्वे प्रातिष्ठन्त तदा तु ते॥<br />When the habitual hours came for eating, the Brahmana had nothing to eat. This happened day after day. All the members of his family were stricken with hunger but were obliged to pass the days as best they could.</p>
<p id='25'>उच्छं तदा शुक्लपक्षे मध्यं तपति भास्करे। उष्णार्तश्च क्षुधार्तश्च विप्रस्तपसि संस्थितः॥<br />One day, in the month of Jyaishtha, while the Sun was in the meridian, the Brahman was engaged, in picking up grains of corn. Afflicted by heat and hunger, he was practicing this penance.</p>
<p id='26'>उज्छमप्राप्तवानेव ब्राह्मणः क्षुच्छ्रमान्वितः। स तथैव क्षुधाविष्टः सार्धं परिजनेन ह॥<br />Unable to obtain of corn, the Brahmana soon became exhausted with hunger and toil. Indeed, with all the members of his family, he had no food to eat.</p>
<p id='27'>क्षपयामास तं कालं कृच्छ्रप्राणो द्विजोत्तमः। अथ षष्ठे गते काले यवप्रस्थमुपार्जयन्॥<br />That best of Brahmanas passed the days in terrible suffering. One day, after the sixth division came, he succeeded in getting a prastha of barley.</p>
<p id='28'>यवप्रस्थं तु तं सक्तूनकुर्वन्त तपस्विनः। कृतजप्याह्निकास्ते तु हुत्वा चार्नि यथाविधि॥ कुडवं कुडवं सर्वे व्यभजन्त तपस्विनः। अथागच्छद् द्विजः कश्चिदतिथिर्भुञ्जतां तदा।॥<br />That barley was then reduced by those ascetics to powder for making what is called Saktu of it. Having finished their silent recitations and other daily rites, and having duly poured libations on the sacred fire, those ascetics divided that little quantity of powdered barley amongst them selves so that the share of each came up to the measure of Kudava (twelve double handfuls). As they were about to sit down for cating, there came to their abode a guest.</p>
<p id='29'>ते तं दृष्ट्वातिथिं प्राप्तं प्रहृष्टमनसोऽभवन्। तेऽभिवाद्य सुखप्रश्न पृष्ट्वा तमतिथि तदा॥<br />Seeing the person who came as a guest, all of them became highly pleased. Indeed, seeing him, they saluted him and made the usual inquiries of health and happiness.</p>
<p id='30'>विशुद्धमनसो दान्ताः श्रद्धादमसमन्विताः। अनसूयवो विक्रोधाः साधवो वीतमत्सराः॥<br />They were of pure minds, self-controlled, and gifted with faith and control over the passions. Freed from malice, they all conquered anger. Possessed of piety, they were never pained at seeing other people's happiness.</p>
<p id='31'>त्यक्तमानमदक्रोधा धर्मज्ञा द्विजसत्तमाः। स ब्रह्मचर्यं गोत्रं ते तस्य ख्यात्वा परस्परम्॥ कुटी प्रवेशयामासुः क्षुधार्तमतिथिं तदा। इदमर्थ्य च पाद्यं च वृसी चेयं तवानघ॥<br />They had renounced pride and haughtiness and anger. Indeed, they knew every duty, O foremost of twice-born ones! Informing their guest of their own penances and of the race or family to which they belonged, and ascertaining from him in return those particulars, they caused that hungry guest of theirs to enter their cottage. Addressing him they said, This is the Arghya for you. This water is for washing your feet. There are scattered some Kusha grass for your seat, O sinless one.</p>
<p id='32'>शुचयः सक्तवश्चमे नियमोपार्जिताः प्रभो। प्रतिगृह्णीष्व भद्रं ते मया दत्ता द्विजर्षभ॥<br />Here is some clean Saktu acquired by lawful means, O powerful one! Given by us, O foremost of twice-born persons, do you accept it.</p>
<p id='33'>इत्युक्तः प्रतिगृह्याथ सक्तूनां कुडवं द्विजः। भक्षयामास राजेन्द्र न च तुष्टि जगाम सः॥<br />Thus addressed by them, that Brahmana accepted the Kudava (twelve double handfuls) of powdered barley which was offered to him and ate it all. But his hunger, O king, was not satisfied with what he ate.</p>
<p id='34'>स उच्छवृत्तिस्तं प्रेक्ष्य क्षुधापरिगतं द्विजम्। आहारं चिन्तयामास कथं तुष्टो भवेदिति॥<br />The Brahmana while observing the Unchcha vow, seeing that his guest's hunger was still unsatisfied, began to think of what other food he could place before him for pleasing him.</p>
<p id='35'>तस्य भार्याब्रवीद् वाक्यं मद्भागो दीयतामिति। गच्छत्वेष यथाकामं परितुष्टो द्विजोत्तमः॥<br />Then his wife said to him. Let my share be given to him! Let this foremost of twice-born persons be pleased and let him then go wherever he will.</p>
<p id='36'>इति ब्रुवन्तीं तां साध्वी भार्यां स द्विजसत्तमः। क्षुधापरिगतां ज्ञात्वा तान् सक्तून् नाभ्यनन्दत॥<br />Knowing that his chaste wife who said so, was herself stricken with hunger, that best of Brahmanas could not approve of her share of the powdered barley being given to the guest.</p>
<p id='37'>आत्मानुमायो विद्वान् स तु विप्रर्षभस्तदा। जानन् वृद्धां क्षुधा” च श्रान्तां ग्लानां तपस्विनीम्।४४ त्वगस्थिभूतां वेपन्तीं ततो भार्यामुवाच ह। अपि कीटपतङ्गानां मृगाणां चैव शोभने॥ स्त्रियो रक्ष्याश्च पोषयाश्च न त्वेवं वक्तुमर्हसि। अनुकम्प्यो नरः पल्या पुष्टो रक्षित एव च॥<br />Indeed, that best of Brahmanas endued with learning, knowing from his own state that his aged, toil-worn, cheerless, and helpless wife was herself afflicted by hunger, and seeing that lady who had been emaciated into mere skin and bones, was quivering with weakness, addressed her and said, 'O beautiful one, with even animals, with even worms and insects, wives are fed and protected. You should not, therefore, say so. The wife treats her husband with kindness and feeds and protects him.</p>
<p id='38'>प्रपतेद् यशसे दीप्तात् स च लोकान् न चाप्नुयात्। धर्मकामार्थकार्याणि शुश्रूषा कुलसंततिः॥<br />Everything connected with religion, pleasure, and wealth, careful nursing, offspring for perpetuating the race, are all dependent on the wife. Indeed, the merits of a person himself as also of his deceased ancestors depend also on her.</p>
<p id='39'>दारेष्वधीनो धर्मश्च पितॄणामात्मनस्तथा। न वेत्ति कर्मतो भार्यारक्षणे योऽक्षमः पुमान्॥ अयशो महदाप्नोति नरकांश्चैव गच्छति।<br />The wife should know her husband by his deeds. Indeed, that man who fails to protect his wife, carns great infamy here and goes into Hell hereafter. Such a man falls down from even a position of great fame and never succeeds in acquiring happy regions hereafter.</p>
<p id='40'>इत्युक्ता सा ततः प्राह धर्माथौ नौ समौ द्विज॥ सक्तुप्रस्थचतुर्भागं गृहाणेमं प्रसीद मे।<br />Thus addressed, she answered him, saying, O twice-born one, our religions acts and wealth are united. Do you take a fourth of this barley! Indeed, be pleased with me.</p>
<p id='41'>सत्यं रतिश्च धर्मश्च स्वर्गश्च गुणनिर्जितः॥ स्त्रीणां पतिसमाधीनं कांक्षितं च द्विजर्षभ।<br />Truth, pleasure, religious merit, and Heaven, as acquirable by good qualities, of women, as also all the objects of their desire, O foremost of twice-born ones, depend on the husband.</p>
<p id='42'>ऋतुर्मातुः पितुर्बीजं दैवतं परमं पतिः॥ भर्तुः प्रसादान्नारीणां रतिपुत्रफलं तथा।<br />In the production of children the mother contributes her blood. The father contributes his sced. The husband is the highest deity of the wife. Through the favour of the husband, women get both pleasure and offspring as the reward.</p>
<p id='43'>पालनाद्धि पतिस्त्वं मे भर्तासि भरणाच्च मे॥ पुत्रप्रदानाद् वरदस्तस्मात् सक्तून् प्रयच्छ मे।<br />You are my Pati (lord) for the protection you give me. You are my Bhartri for the means of sustenance you give me. You are, again, boon-giver to me one account of your having presented me a son. Do you, therefore, take my share of the barley and give it to the guest.</p>
<p id='44'>जरापरिगतो वृद्धः क्षुधार्तो दुर्बलो भृशम्॥ उपवास परिश्रान्तो यदा त्वमपि कर्शितः।<br />Overcome by decrepitude, you are of advanced years. Afflicted by hunger, you are greatly weakened. Worn out with fasts, you are very much emaciated.</p>
<p id='45'>इत्युक्तः स तया सक्तून् प्रगृह्येदं वचोऽब्रवीत्॥ द्विज सक्तूनिमान भूयः प्रतिगृह्णीष्व सत्तम।<br />Thus addressed by her, he took her share of the powdered barley and addressing his guest, said, 'O twice-bom one, O best of men, do you accept this quantity of powdered barley as well.</p>
<p id='46'>स तान् प्रगृह्य भुक्त्वा च र तुष्टिमगमद् द्विजः। तमुच्छवृत्तिरालक्ष्य ततश्चिन्तापरोऽभवत्॥<br />The Brahmana, having accepted that quantity, immediately ate it up, but his hunger was not yet satisfied. Secing him ungratified, the Brahmana in the observance of the Unchcha vow became thoughtful.</p>
<p id='47'>सक्तूनिमान् प्रगृह्य त्वं देहि विप्राय सत्तम। इत्येव सुकृतं मन्ये तस्मादेतत् करोम्यहम्॥<br />His son then said to him 'O best of men, taking my share of the barley do you give it to the guest! I consider this act of mine as one of great merit. Therefore, I do it.</p>
<p id='48'>भवान् हि परिपाल्यो मे सर्वदैव प्रयत्नतः। साधूनां काक्षितं यस्मात् पितुर्वृद्धस्य पालनम्॥<br />You should be always maintained by me with great care. Maintenance of the father is a duty which the good always covet.</p>
<p id='49'>पुत्रार्थो विहितो ह्येष वार्धके परिपालनम्। श्रुतिरेषा हि विप्रर्षे त्रिषु लोकेषु शाश्वती॥<br />The maintenance of the father in his old age is the duty laid down for the son. This is the eternal Shruti (audition) current in the three worlds, O learned Rishi.</p>
<p id='50'>प्राणधारणमात्रेण शक्यं कर्तुं तपस्त्वया। प्राणो हि परमो धर्मः स्थितो देहेषु देहिनाम्॥<br />By living on barely you are capable of practicing penances. The life-breath is the great deity which lives in the bodies of all embodied creatures.'</p>
<p id='51'>पितोवाच अपि वर्षसहस्री त्वं बाल एव मतो मम। उत्पाद्य पुत्रं हि पिता कृतकृत्यो भवेत् सुतात्॥<br />The Father said If you attain to the age of even a thousand year, You will still seem to me to be only a little child. Having begotten a son, the father achieves success through him.</p>
<p id='52'>बालानां क्षुद् बलवती जानाम्येतदहं प्रभो। वृद्धोऽहं धारयिष्यामि त्वं बली भव पुत्रका६१।।<br />O powerful me, I know that the hunger of children is very strong. I am old. I shall somehow succeed in holding my life-breaths. Do you, O son, become strong.</p>
<p id='53'>न मां जीर्णेन वयसा पुत्र क्षुद् बाधतेऽपि च। दीर्घकालं तपस्तप्तं न मे मरणतो भयम्॥<br />Old and decrepit as I am, O son, hunger scarcely afflicts me. I have, again, for many years, practiced penances. I have no fear of death.</p>
<p id='54'>पुत्र उवाच अपत्यमस्मि ते पुंसस्त्राणात् पुत्र इति स्मृतः। आत्मा पुत्रः स्मृतस्तस्मात् बाह्यात्मानमिहात्मना॥<br />The Son said-I am your offspring. The Shruti declare that one's offspring is called Putra, because one is rescued by him. One's own self, again, takes birth as his son. Do you, therefore, rescue yourself by your own self.</p>
<p id='55'>पितोवाच रूपेण सदृशस्त्वं मे शीलेन च दमेन च। परीक्षितश्च बहुधा सक्तूनादह्यि ते सुत॥<br />The Father said In forin you are like me. In conduct and in self-control, also you are my like. You have been examined on various occasions by me. I shall, therefore, accept your share of the barley, O son!</p>
<p id='56'>इत्युक्त्वाऽऽदाय तान् सक्तून् प्रीतात्मा द्विजसत्तमः। प्रहसन्निव विप्राय स तस्मै प्रददौ तदा॥<br />Having said this, that foremost of twiceborn persons cheerfully took his son's share of the barley and smilingly presented it to his twice-born guest.</p>
<p id='57'>भुक्त्वा तानपि सक्तूत् स नैव तुष्टो बभूव ह। उच्छवृत्तिस्तु धर्मात्मा व्रीडामनुजगाम ह॥<br />Having eaten that barley also, the guest's hunger was not satisfied. The righteous-should host in the observance of the Unchcha vow became asharmed.</p>
<p id='58'>तं वै वधूः स्थिता साध्वी ब्राह्मणप्रियकाम्यया। सक्तूनादाय संहृष्टा श्वशुरं वाक्यमब्रवीत्॥ संतानात् तव संतानं मम विप्र भविष्यति। सक्तूनिमानतिथये गृहीत्वा सम्प्रयच्छ मे॥<br />Desirous of doing what was agreeable to him, his chaste daughter-in-law then, bearing her share of the barley, approached him and said, Through your son, O learned Brahmana, I shall obtain a son. Do you, therefore, take my share of the barley and give it to this guest.</p>
<p id='59'>तव प्रसादान्निर्वृत्ता मम लोकाः किलाक्षयाः। पुत्रेण तानवाप्नोति यत्र गत्वा न शोचति॥<br />Through your grace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity Through a grandson one obtains those regions going where one has not to suffer any kind of misery.</p>
<p id='60'>धर्माद्या हि यथा त्रेता वह्निनेता तथैव च। तथैव पुत्रपौत्राणां स्वर्गस्त्रेता किलाक्षयः॥<br />Like the three-fold objects of life beginning with Religion, or the three-fold sacred fires, there is a triple aggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson, and the great-grandson.</p>
<p id='61'>पितृन्णात् तारयति पुत्र इत्यनुशुश्रुमा पुत्रपौत्रेश्च नियतं साधुलोकानुपाश्नुते॥<br />The son is called Putra because he frees his ancestor's debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the happiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.</p>
<p id='62'>श्वशुर उवाच वातातपविशीर्णाङ्गी त्वां विवर्णो निरीक्ष्य वै। कर्षितां सुव्रताचारे क्षुधविह्वलचेतसम्॥ कथं सक्तून् ग्रहन्यामि भूत्वा धर्मोपघातकः। कल्याणवृत्ते कल्याणि नैवं त्वं वक्तुमर्हसि॥<br />The Father-in-law said-O you of excellent vows and conduct, seeing you wasted by wind and sun, deprived of your very complexion, emaciated, and almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a transgressor against the rules of virtue as to take your share of the barley? O auspicious damsel, you should not say so, for the sake of those auspicious results for which every family must try.</p>
<p id='63'>षष्ठे काले व्रतवती शौचशीलतपोऽन्विताम्। कृच्छ्रवृत्तिं निराहारां द्रक्ष्यामि त्वां कथं शुभे॥<br />O auspicious lady, how can I hold you at even this the sixth division of the day abstaining from food and observing vows? You are gifted with purity and good conduct and penances. Alas, even you have to pass your days in so much misery.</p>
<p id='64'>बाला क्षुधार्ता नारी च रक्ष्या त्वं सततं मया। उपवासपरिश्रान्ता त्वं हि बान्धवनन्दिनी॥<br />You are a child, afflicted by hunger, and belong to the softer sex. You should be always protected by mc! Alas, I have to see you worn out with fasts, O you who are the delighter of all your kinsmen.</p>

You are, indeed, the god of my god. Do you, therefore, O powerful one, take my share of the barley.</p>
