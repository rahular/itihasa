<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 83</h3><h4>The glory of kine</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच ये च गां सम्प्रयच्छन्ति हतशिष्टाशिनश्च ये। तेषां सत्राणि यज्ञाश्च नित्यमेव युधिष्ठिर॥<br />Bhishma said on They who make gifts of kine, and who live upon the remnants of things offered as libations the sacred fire, are considered, O Yudhishthira as always performing sacrifices of kind.</p>
<p id='2'>ऋते दधि घृतेनेह न यज्ञः सम्प्रवर्तते। तेन यज्ञस्य यज्ञत्वमतो मूलं च कथ्यते॥<br />No sacrifice can be performed without the help of curds and clarified butter. The very character as sacrifice which sacrifices have, depends upon clarified butter. Hence clarified butter is considered as the very root of sacrifice.</p>
<p id='3'>दानानामपि सर्वेषां गवां दानं प्रशस्यते। गावः श्रेष्ठाः पवित्राश्च पावनं ह्येतदुत्तमम्॥<br />Of all kinds of gifts, the gift of kine is spoken highest of. Kine are the foremost of all things. Themselves sacred, they are the best of purifier.</p>
<p id='4'>पुष्ट्यर्थमेताः सेवेत शान्त्यथर्मपि चैव ह। पयोदधिघृतं चासां सर्वपापप्रमोचनम्॥<br />People should cherish kine for getting prosperity and even peace. The milk, curds, and clarified butter that kine yield are capable of purifying one from every kind of sin.</p>
<p id='5'>गावस्तेजः पर प्रोक्तमिह लोके परत्र च। न गोभ्यः परमं किंचित् पवित्रं भरतर्षभ।॥<br />Kine are said to represent the highest energy both in this world and the next. There is nothing that is more sacred or purifying than kine, O chief of the Bharatas.</p>
<p id='6'>अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। पितामहस्य संवादमिन्द्रस्य च युधिष्ठिर॥<br />Regarding it is recited the ancient discourse between the Grandfather and chief of the celestials.</p>
<p id='7'>पराभूतेषु दैत्येषु शक्रस्त्रिभुवनेश्वरः। प्रजाः समुदिताः सर्वाः सत्यधर्मपरायणाः॥<br />After the demons had been defeated and Shakra had become the lord of the three worlds, all creatures grew prosperous and became devoted to the true religion.</p>
<p id='8'>अथर्षयः सगन्धर्वाः किन्नरोरगराक्षसाः। देवासुरसुपर्णाश्च प्रजानां पतयस्तथा॥ पुर्यपासन्त कौन्तेय कदाचिद् वै पितामहम्। नारदः पर्वतश्चैव विश्वावसुर्हहाहुहूः॥ दिव्यतानेषु गायन्तः पर्युपासन्त तं प्रभुम्। तत्र दिव्यानि पुष्पाणि प्रावहत् पवनस्तदा॥<br />Then, on one occasion, the Rishis, the Gandharvas, the Kinnaras, the Uragas, the Rakshasas, the Deities, the Asuras, the winged crcatures, and the Prajapatis, O you of Kuru's race, ali assembled together and worshipped the Grandfather. There were Narada and Parvata and Vishvavasu and HahaHuhu, who sang celestial songs for worshipping that powerful lord of all creatures. The god of wind bore there the fragrance of celestial flowers.</p>
<p id='9'>आजहुर्ऋतवश्चापि सुगन्धीनि पृथक् पृथक्। तस्मिन् देवसमावाये सर्वभूतसमागमे॥ दिव्यवादित्रसंघुष्टे दिव्यस्त्रीचारणावृते। इन्द्रः पप्रच्छ देवेशमभिवाद्य प्रणम्य च॥ देवानां भगवन् कस्माल्लोकेशानां पितामह। उपरिष्टाद् गवां लोक एतदिच्छामि वेदितुम्॥<br />The Seasons also, in their embodied forms, bore the fragrance of flowers peculiar to each, to that assemblage of celestials, that gathering of all creatures of the universe, where celestial maidens danced and sang in accompaniment with celestial music. In the midst of that assembly, Indra, saluting the Lord of all the celestial and bowing his head to him with respect, asked him, saying, I wish, O Grandfather, to know why the region of kine is higher, O holy one, than the region of the celestials themselves who are the lords of all the worlds.</p>
<p id='10'>किं तपो ब्रह्मचर्यं वा गोभिः कृतमिहेश्वर। देवानामुपरिष्टाद् यद् वसन्त्यरजसः मुखम्॥<br />What austerities, what Brahmacharya, O lord, did kine perform on account of which they are able to live happily in a region that is even above that of the celestials.</p>
<p id='11'>ततः प्रोवाच ब्रह्मा तं शक्रं बलनिषूदनम्। अवज्ञातास्त्वया नित्यं गावो बलनिषूदन॥<br />Thus addressed by Indra, Brahman said to the destroyer of Bala, You have always, O destroyer of Bala, disregarded kine.</p>
<p id='12'>तेन त्वमासां माहात्म्यं न वेत्सि शृणु यत् प्रभो। गवां प्रभावं परमं माहात्म्यं च सुरर्षभ॥<br />Hence, you are not acquainted with glorious pereminence of kine. Listen now to me, o powerful one, as I explain to you the great energy and glorious pereminence of kine, O king of the celestials.</p>
<p id='13'>यज्ञाझं कथिता गावो यज्ञ एव च वासव। एताभिश्च विना यज्ञो न वर्तेत कथंचन॥<br />Kine have been said to be the limbs of sacrifice. They represent sacrifice itself, O Vasava! Without them there can be no sacrifice.</p>
<p id='14'>धारयन्ति प्रजाश्चैव पयसा हविषा तथा। एतासां तनयाश्चापि कृषियोगमुपासते॥ जनयन्ति च धान्यानि बीजानि विविधानि च।<br />With their milk and the Havi produced therefrom, they sustain all creatures. Their male children are engaged in helping the cultivation and thereby produce various kinds of paddy and other seeds.</p>
<p id='15'>ततो यज्ञाः प्रवर्तन्ते हव्यं कव्यं च सर्वशः॥ पयोदधिधृतं चैव पुण्याश्चैताः सुराधिप। वहन्ति विविधान् भारान् क्षुत्तृष्णापरिपीडिताः॥<br />From them originate sacrifices and Havya and Kavya, and milk and curds and clarified butter. Hence, O chief of the celestials, kine are sacred. Stricken with hunger and thirst, they carry various burthens.</p>
<p id='16'>मुनींश्च धारयन्तीह प्रजाश्चैवापि कर्मणा। वासवाकूटवाहिन्यः कर्मणा सुकूतेन च॥<br />Kine support ascetics. They sustain all creatures by various acts. O Vasava, kine are guileless in their conduct on account of such conduct and of many wellperformed acts, they are able to live always in regions that are even above ours.</p>
<p id='17'>उपरिष्टात् ततोऽस्माकं वसन्त्येताः सदैव हि। एवं ते कारणं शक्र निवासकृतमद्य वै॥<br />I have thus explained to you today, O you of a hundred sacrifices, the reason, O Shakra, of kine living in a place that is high above that of the celestials.</p>
<p id='18'>गवां देवोपरिष्टाद्धि समाख्यातं शतक्रतो। एता हि वरदत्ताश्च वरदाश्चापि वासव॥<br />Kine got many excellent forms, O Vasava, and are themselves givers of boons. They are called Surabhis. Of sacred deeds and gifted with many auspicious marks they are highly purifying.</p>
<p id='19'>सुरभ्यः पुण्यकर्मिण्यः पावनाः शुभलक्षणाः। यदर्थं गां गताश्चैव सुरभ्यः सुरसत्तम॥<br />Listen to me also, O destroyer of Bala, as I tell you in full the reason why kine, the children of Surabhi, have descended on the Earth, O best of the celestials.</p>
<p id='20'>तच्च मे शृणु कार्येन वदतो बलसूदन। पुरा देवयुगे तात देवेन्द्रेषु महात्मसु॥ त्रिलोकाननुशासत्सु विष्णौ गर्भत्वमागते। अदित्यास्तप्यमानायास्तपो घोरं सुदुश्चरम्॥<br />Formerly , O son, when in the golden age the great Danavas became lords of the three worlds, Aditi performed the severest austerities and got Vishnu within her womb. Indeed, O chief of the celestials, she had stood upon one leg for many long years, desirous of having a son.</p>
<p id='21'>पुत्रार्थममरश्रेष्ठ पादेनैकेन नित्यदा। तां तु दृष्ट्वा महादेवीं तप्यमानां महत्तपः॥ दक्षस्य दुहिता देवी सुरभी नाम नामतः। अतप्यत तपो घोरं हृष्टा धर्मपरायणा॥ कैलासशिखरे रम्ये देवगन्धर्वसेविते। व्यतिष्ठदेकपादेन परमं योगमास्थिता॥ दशवर्षसहस्राणि दशवर्षशतानि च। संतप्तास्तपसा तस्या देवाः सर्षिमहोरगाः॥<br />Seeing the great goddess Aditi thus practising the severest austerities, the daughter of Daksha, viz., the illustrious Surabhi, herself given to virtue likewise practised very severe austerities upon the breast of the charming mountains of Kailasa that are resorted to by both the celestials and the Gandharvas. Established on the highest Yoga, she also stood upon the leg for eleven thousand years. The celestials with the Rishis and the great Nagas all became scorched with the severity of her penances. Going there with me, all of them began of worship that auspicious goddess.</p>
<p id='22'>तत्र गत्वा मया सार्धं पर्युपासन्त तां शुभाम्। अथाहमब्रुवं तत्र देवीं तां तपसान्विताम्॥<br />I then addressed that goddess gifted with penances, and said, O goddess, O you of faultless conduct, for what purpose do you practise such severe austerities,</p>
<p id='23'>किमर्थं तप्यसे देवि तपो घोरमनिन्दिते। प्रीतस्तेऽहं महाभागे तपसानेन शोभने॥<br />O highlyblessed one, I am pleased with your penances, O beautiful one! Do you, O goddess, beg what boon you wish to have. I shall grant you whatever, you may ask! These were my words to her, O Purandara.</p>
<p id='24'>वरयस्व वरं देवि दातास्मीति पुरंदर।॥ वरेण भगवन् मह्यं कृतं लोकपितामह। एष एव वरो मेऽद्य यत् प्रीतोऽसि ममानघ।॥ तामेवं ब्रुवती देवीं सुरभिं त्रिदशेश्वर। प्रत्यब्रुवं यद् देवेन्द्र तन्निबोध शचीपते॥<br />Thus addressed by me, Surabhi answered me, saying, I have no need O grandfather of boons. O sinless one, that you have been pleased with me is a great boon to me. To the illustrious Surabhi, O chief of the celestials, who said so to me, O lord of Sachi, I answered thus, O goddess, I have been highly pleased with this your freedom from cupidity and desire, and with these penances of yours, O you of beautiful face. I therefore, grant you the boon of immortality.</p>
<p id='25'>अलोभकाम्यया देवि तपसा च शुभानने। प्रसन्नोऽहं वरं तस्मादमरत्वं ददामि ते॥<br />You will live in a region that is higher than the three worlds, through my favour. That region shall be known to all by the name of Goloka.</p>
<p id='26'>त्रयाणामपि लोकानामुपरिष्टान्निवत्स्यसि। मत्प्रसादाच्च विख्यातो गोलोकः सम्भविष्यति॥<br />Your offspring, ever engaged in doing good deeds, will live in the world of men, In fact, O highly blessed one, your daughters will live there.</p>
<p id='27'>मानुषेषु च कुर्वाणाः प्रजा: कर्म शुभास्तव। निवत्स्यन्ति महाभागे सर्वा दुहितश्च ते॥ मनसा चिन्तिता भोगास्वत्वया वै दिव्यमानुषाः। यच्च सर्वं सुखं देवि तत् ते सम्पत्स्यते शुभे॥<br />You will readily get all kinds of enjoyment, celestial and human, that you may think of. You will get whatever happiness exists in the celestial region, O blessed one! The regions, O you of a hundred eyes, that are Surabhi's are replete with means for the satisfaction of every desire, Neither Death, nor Decrepitude, nor fire, can overcome its inhabitants.</p>
<p id='28'>तस्या लोकाः सहस्राक्ष सर्वकामसमन्विताः। न तत्र क्रमते मृत्युर्न जरा न च पावकः॥<br />No illluck, O Vasava exists there, many charining forests and delightful ornaments and objects of beauty may be seen there.</p>
<p id='29'>न दैवं नाशुभं किंचिद् विद्यते तत्र वासव। तत्र दिव्यान्यरण्यानि दिव्यानि भवनानि च॥ विमानानि सुयुक्तानि कामगानि च वासव। ब्रह्मचर्येण तपसा यत्नेन च दमेन च॥<br />There may be seen many beautiful cars, all excellently equipt and which move at the will of the rider, O Vasava. O you having eyes like lotus petals, it is only by celibacy, by penances, by Truth, by self-control, by gifts, by various kinds of righteous deeds, by sojourns lo sacred waters, in fact, by severe austerities and righteous deeds well-performed, that one can attain to Goloka.</p>
<p id='30'>दानैश्च विविधैः पुण्यैस्तथा तीर्थानुसेवनात्। तपसा महता चैव सुकृतेन च कर्मणा॥<br />You had asked me, O Shakra and I have answered you in full. O destroyer of Asuras, you should never disregard kine!</p>
<p id='31'>भीष्म उवाच शक्यः समासादयितुं गोलोकः पुष्करेक्षण। एतत् ते सर्वमाख्यातं मया शक्रानुपृच्छते॥<br />Bhishma said learing these words of the self-creale Brahman, O Yudhishthira, Shakra of a thousand eyes began from that time to adore kine every day and to show them the greatest respect.</p>
<p id='32'>न ते परिभवः कार्यो गवामसुरसूदन॥ एतच्छ्रुत्वा सहस्राक्षः पूजयामास नित्यदा। गाश्चक्रे बहुमानं च तासु नित्यं युधिष्ठिर॥ एतत् ते सर्वमाख्यातं पावनं च महाद्युते। पवित्रं परमं चापि गवां माहात्म्युमुत्तमम्॥ कीर्तितं पुरुषव्याघ्र सर्वपापविमोचनम्। य इदं कथयेन्नित्यं ब्राह्मणेभ्यः समाहितः॥ हव्यकव्येष यज्ञेषु पितृकार्येषु चैव ह। सार्वकामिकमक्षय्यं पितृस्तस्योपतिष्ठते॥<br />I have thus told you everything about the purifying character of kine, O you of great splendour. I have expounded to you the sacred and high pre-eminence and glory of kine, that is capable of purifying one from every sin, O chief of men.
