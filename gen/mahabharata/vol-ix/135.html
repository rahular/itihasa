From whom may a Kshatriya, a Vaishya and a Shudra take their food respectively?</p>

He must, however, not take food given by Shudras who are given to evil ways and who partake of all sorts of food without any hesitation.</p>

<p id='12'>शूद्रकर्मस्वथैतेषु यो भुङ्क्ते निरपत्रपः। अभोज्यभोजनं भुक्त्वा भयं प्राप्नोति दारुणम्॥ कुलं वीर्यं च तेजश्च तिर्यग्योनित्वमेव च। स प्रयाति यथा श्वा वै निष्क्रियो धर्मवर्जितः॥<br />And those who foolishly partake of food offered at ceremonials in a Shudra's house, suffer from a dreadful disaster. On account of partaking such forbidden food, they loose their family strength and energy, and acquire the status of lower animals degenerating to the position of dogs fallen in virtue and devoid of all religious observances.</p>
