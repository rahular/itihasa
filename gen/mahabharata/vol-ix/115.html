<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 115</h3><h4>Ordinances about meat-eating</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच अहिंसा परमो धर्म इत्युक्तं बहुशस्त्वया। जातो नः संशयो धर्मे मांसस्य परिवर्जने। दोषो भक्षयतः कः स्यात् कश्चाभक्षयतो गुणः॥<br />Yudhishthira said You have told it many times that abstention from injury is the highest Religion. In Shraddhas, however, that are performed in honour of the departed Manes, persons for their own behoof, should make offerings of various kinds of meat. A doubt has, therefore, sprung in our mind about the duty of abstaining from meat. What are the sins that one commits by eating meat, and what are the merits that one acquires?</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>हत्वा भक्षयतो वापि परेणोपहतस्य वा। हन्याद् वा यः परस्यार्थं क्रीत्वा वा भक्षयेन्नरः॥<br />You have said SO So while discoursing formerly upon the ordinances about Shraddhas. How can meat, however, be procured without killing a living creature? Your declarations, therefore, appear to me to be contradictory.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>एतदिच्छामि तत्त्वेन कथ्यमानं त्वयानघ। निश्चयेन चिकीर्षामि धर्ममेतं सनातनम्॥<br />What are the demerits of him who eats meat by himself slaying a living creature? What are the merits of him who eats the meat of animals, slain by others? What the merits or demerits of hini who kills a living creature for another? Or of him who eats meat buying it of others? I wish, O sinless one, that you should describe to me this subject in full. I wish to ascertain this eternal Religion with certainty.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>कथमायुरवाप्नोति कथं भवति सत्त्ववान्। कथमव्यङ्गतामेति लक्षण्यो जायते कथम्॥<br />How does one acquire longevity? How does onc acquire strength? How does one acquire faultlessness of limbs? Indeed, how does one become gifted with excellent marks?</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>भीष्म उवाच मांसस्याभक्षणाद् राजन् यो धर्मः कुरुनन्दन। तन्मे शृणु यथातत्त्वं यथास्य विधिरुत्तमः॥<br />Bhishma said Listen to me, O scion of Kuru's race, what the merit is of abstention from meat. Listen to me as I declare to you what the excellent ordinances, in sooth, are on this subject.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>रूपमव्यङ्गतामायुर्बुद्धिं सत्त्वं बलं स्मृतिम्। प्राप्तुकामैनरैहिंसा वर्जिता वै महात्मभिः॥<br />Those great inen who desire beauty, faultessness of limbs, long life, understanding mental and physical strength, and memory should abstain from acts of injury.</p>

<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>यो यजेताश्वमेधेन मासि मासि यतव्रतः। वर्जयेन्मधु मांसं च सममेतद् युधिष्ठिर॥<br />The merit acquired by that person, O Yudhishthira, who, with the steadiness of a vow, worship the celestials every month in Horse sacrifices, is equal to him who discards honey and meat.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>सप्तर्षयो वालखिल्यास्तथैव च मरीचिपाः। अमांसभक्षणं राजन् प्रशंसन्ति मनीषिणः॥<br />The highly wise seven celestial Rishis, the Valakhillyas, and those Rishi, who drink the rays of the sun, all speak highly of abstention from ineat.</p>

<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>मासि मास्यश्वमेधेन यो यजेत शतं समाः। न खादति च यो मांसं सममेतन्मतं मम॥<br />In my view, these two persons are equal viz.hc who worships the celestials every month in a Horse-sacrifice for a century and he who abstains from honey and meat.</p>

<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>दुष्करं च रसज्ञाने मांसस्य परिवर्जनम्। चर्तुं व्रतमिदं श्रेष्ठं सर्वप्राण्यभयप्रदम्॥<br />It is very difficult to abstain from meat after one has known itstaste. Indeed, it is extremely difficult for such a person to observe the great vow abstention from meat, a vow that assures every creature by removing all fear.</p>
