<h3>NARADAGAMANA PARVA: Chapter 39</h3><h4>Narada describes the history of the death</h4><p id='1'>नारद उवाच नासौ वृथाग्निना दग्धो यथा तत्र श्रुतं मया। वैचित्रवीर्यो नृपतिस्तत् ते वक्ष्यामि सुव्रत॥<br />Narada said The king has not been burnt to death by an unsanctified fire. I have heard this there. I tell you, O Bharata, such has not been the fate of Vaichitravirya.</p>
<p id='2'>वनं प्रविशतानेन वायुभक्षेण धीमता। अग्नयः कारयिन्वेष्टिमुत्सृष्टा इति नः श्रुतम्॥<br />We have heard that when the old king gifted with great intelligence and living on air alone entered the forest (after his return from Gangadvara), he caused his sacrificial fires to be duly ignited. Having performed is sacred rites there with, be abandoned them all.</p>

<p id='4'>स विवृद्धस्तदा वह्निर्वने तस्मिन्नभूत् किल। तेन तद् वनमादीप्तमिति ते तापसाऽब्रुवन्॥<br />The fire that cast off grew in the forest. It then produced a general conflagration in the forest. This is what I have heard from the ascetics living on the banks of Ganga.</p>
<p id='5'>स राजा जाह्नवीतीरे यथा ते कथितं मया। तेनाग्निना समायुक्तः स्वेनैव भरतर्षभ।॥<br />United with that (sacred) fire of his own, O chief of the Bharatas, the king, as I have already said to you, met with death on the banks of Ganga.</p>
