<h3>ASHRAMAVASIKA PARVA: Chapter 12</h3><h4>Arjuna advises Bhima, to give up his hostile feelings</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>अर्जुन उवाच भीम ज्येष्ठो गुरुर्मे त्वं नातोऽन्यद् वक्तुमुत्सहे। धृतराष्ट्रस्तु राजर्षिः सर्वथा मानमर्हति॥<br />Arjuna said O Bhima, you are my elder brother and, therefore, my senior and preceptor. I dare not say anything more than what I have already said. The royal sage Dhritarashtra deserves to be honoured by us in every way.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>न स्मरन्त्यपराद्धानि स्मरन्ति सुकृतान्यपि। असम्भिन्नार्यमर्यादाः साधवः पुरुषोत्तमाः॥<br />They who are good, they who are distinguished above the common level, they who break not the distinctions which characterise the good, remember which characterise the good, remember not the wrongs done to them but only the benefits they have got.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>इति तस्य वचः श्रुत्वा फाल्गुनस्य महात्मनः। विदुरं प्राह धर्मात्मा कुन्तीपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरः॥ इदं मद्वचनात् क्षत्तः कौरवं ब्रूहि पार्थिवम्। यावदिच्छति पुत्राणां श्राद्धं तावद् ददाम्यहम्॥ भीष्मादीनां च सर्वेषां सुहृदामुपकारिणाम्। मम कोशादिति विभो मा भूद् भीम: सुदुर्मनाः॥<br />Hearing these words of the great Phalguna, the righteous-souled Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, addressed Vidura and said these words, "Instructed by me, O Kshatri, do you say to the Kuru king that I shall give him as much wealth from my treasury as he wishes to give away for the obsequies of his sons, and of Bhishma and others among his well-wishers and benefactors, let not Bhima be dispirited at this.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच इत्युक्त्वा धर्मराजस्तमर्जुनं प्रत्यपूजयत्। भीमसेनः कटाक्षेण वीक्षां चक्रे धनंजयम्॥<br />Having said these words, king Yudhishthira the just highly applauded Arjuna. Meanwhile Bhimasena began to cast angry looks at Dhananjaya.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>ततः स विदुरं धीमान् वाक्यमाह युधिष्ठिरः। भीमसेने न कोपं स नृपतिः कतुमर्हति॥<br />Then Yudhishthira, gifted with great intelligence, once more addressed Vidura said, King Dhritarashtra should not be angry with Bhimasena.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>परिक्लिष्टो हि भीमोऽपि हिमवृष्ट्यातपादिभिः। दुःखैर्बहुविधैर्धीमानरण्ये विदितं तव॥<br />This Bhima of great intelligence was greatly afflicted by cold and rain and heat and by a thousand others griefs while living in the forest. All this you know.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>किं तु मद्वचनाद् ब्रूहि राजानं भरतर्षभ। यद् यदिच्छसि यावच्च गृह्यतां मद्गृहादिति॥<br />Do you, however, instructed by me, say to the king, O foremost one of Bharata's family, that he may take from my house whatever articles he wishes and in whatever measure also he likes.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>यन्मात्सर्यमयं भीमः करोति भृशदुःखितः। न तन्मनसि कर्तव्यमिति वाच्यः स पार्थिवः॥<br />You shall also tell the king that he should not suffer his heart to remember this show of pride in which Bhima, deeply afflicted, has indulged.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>यन्ममास्ति धनं किंचिदर्जुनस्य च वेश्मनि। तस्य स्वामी महाराज इति वाच्यः स पार्थिवः॥<br />Whatever wealth I have and whatever Arjuna has in his house, the owner thereof is king Dhritarashtra. This you should tell him.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>ददातु राजा विप्रेभ्यो यथेष्टं क्रियतां व्ययः। पुत्राणां सुहृदां चैव गच्छत्वानृण्यमद्य सः॥<br />Let the king made gifts to Brahmanas! Let him spend as largely as he likes. Let him liberate himself from the debt he owes to his sons and well-wishers.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>इदं चापि शरीरं मे तवायत्तं जनाधिप। धनानि चेति विद्धि त्वं न मे तत्रास्ति संशयः॥<br />Let him be told besides, 'O monarch this very body of mine is at your disposal, and all the riches I have! Know this and let there be no doubt in this.</p>
