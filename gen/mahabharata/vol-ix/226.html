<h3>ANUGITA PARVA: Chapter 58</h3><h4>The story of Utanka and Saudasa</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच स मित्रसहमासाद्य अभिज्ञानमयाचत। तस्मै ददावभिज्ञानं स चेक्ष्वाकुवरस्तदा॥<br />Vaishampayana said Returning to king Saudasa who was always well-disposed towards all his friends, Utanka solicited him for some sign. That foremost one of Ikshaku's race then gave him a sign.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>सौदास उवाच न चैवैषा गतिः क्षेम्या न चान्या विद्यते गतिः। एतन्मे मतमाज्ञाय प्रयच्छ मणिकुण्डले॥<br />Saudasa said This my present condition is intolerable. I do not see any refuge. Knowing this to be my wish, do you give away the jewelled ear-rings.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>इत्युक्तस्तामुत्तङ्कस्तु भर्तुर्वाक्यमथाब्रवीत्। श्रुत्वा च सा तदा प्रादात् ततस्ते मणिकुण्डले॥<br />Thus addressed by the king, Utanka returned to the queen and reported to her the world of her husband. Hearing those words, the queen gave to Utanka her jewelled ear-rings.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>अवाप्य कुण्डले ते तु राजानं पुनरब्रवीत्। किमेतद् गुह्यवचनं श्रोतुमिच्छामि पार्थिव॥<br />Having got the ear-rings, Utanka returned to the king and said to him, 'I wish to hear, O king, what the meaning is of those mysterious words which you said as a sign to your queen.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>सौदास उवाच प्रजानिसर्गाद् विप्रान् वै क्षत्रियाः पूजयन्ति ह। विप्रेभ्यश्चापि बहवो दोषाः प्रादुर्भवन्ति वै॥<br />Saudasa said Kshatriyas are seen to honour the Brahmanas from the very beginning of the creation. Towards the Brahmanas, however, many offences originate (on the part of the Kshatriyas).</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>सोऽहं द्विजेभ्यः प्रणतो विप्राद् दोषमवाप्तवान्। गतिमन्यां न पश्यामि मदयन्तीसहायवान्॥<br />As for myself, I am always bent in humility before them. I am overtaken by a calamity through a Brahmana. Possessed of Madayanti, I do not see any other refuge.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>न चान्यामपि पश्यामि गतिं गतिमतां वर। स्वर्गद्वारस्य गमने स्थाने चेह द्विजोत्तम॥<br />Indeed, O foremost of all persons, having a high goal, I do not see any other refuge for myself in the matter of approaching the celestial gates or in continuing here, O best of twice-born ones.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>न हि राज्ञा विशेषेण विरुद्धेन द्विजातिभिः। शक्यं हि लोके स्थातुं वै प्रेत्य वा सुखमेधितुम्॥<br />It is impossible for a king that is hostile to Brahmanas to continue living in this world or in acquiring happiness in the next.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>तदिष्टे ते मया दत्ते एते स्वे मणिकुण्डले। यः कृतस्तेऽद्य समय: सफलं तं कुरुध्व मे॥<br />Hence have I given you these my jewelled ear-rings which were coveted by you. Do you now keep the agreement which you have made with me today.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>उत्तङ्क उवाच राजस्तथेह कर्तास्मि पुनरेष्यामि ते वशम्। प्रश्नं च कंचित् प्रष्टु त्वां निवृत्तेऽस्मि परंतप॥<br />Utanka said O king, I shall certainly carry out my promise. I shall truly return and place myself under your power. There is, however, a question, O scorcher of enemies which I wish to ask you.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>ब्रूहि विप्र यथाकामं प्रतिवक्तास्मि ते वचः। छेत्तास्मि सशयं तेऽद्य न मेऽत्रास्ति विचारणा॥<br />Saudasa said Say, O learned Brahmana, what is in your mind. I shall certainly reply to your words. I shall remove whatever doubt may being your mind. I have no hesitation in this.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>प्राहुर्वाक्संयतं विप्रं धर्मनैपुणदर्शिनः। मित्रेषु यश्च विषमः स्तेन इत्येव तं विदुः॥<br />Utanka said Those who are skilled in the rules of duty, say that Brahmanas are of controlled speech. One who acts wrongly towards friends is considered as vile as a thief.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>स भवान् मित्रतामद्य सम्प्राप्तो मम पार्थिव। स मे बुद्धिं प्रयच्छस्व सम्मतां पुरुषर्षभ॥<br />You, again, O king, have become my friend today. Do you then, O foremost of men, give me such advice as is approved by the wise.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>अवाप्तार्थोऽहमद्येह भवांश्च पुरुषादकः। भवत्सकाशमागन्तुं क्षमं मम न वेति वै॥<br />As for myself, I have now obtained the fruition of my wishes. You, again, are a cannibal. Is it proper for me to return to you or not.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>सौदास उवाच क्षमं चेदिह वक्तव्यं तव द्विजवरोत्तम। मत्समीपं द्विजश्रेष्ठ नागन्तव्यं कथंचन॥<br />Saudasa said If it is proper (for me), O foremost of superior Brahmanas, to say what you ask, I should then, O best of twice-born ones, tell you that you should never return to me.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>एवं तव प्रपश्यामि श्रेयो भृगुकुलोद्वह। आगच्छतो हि ते विप्र भवेन्मृत्युर्न संशयः॥<br />O perpetuator of Bhrigu's race, by acting thus, you will secure your well-being. If you return, O learned Brahmana, you will surely meet with death.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच इत्युक्तः स तदा राज्ञा क्षमं बुद्धिमतां हितम्। अनुज्ञाप्य स राजानमहल्यां प्रतिजग्मिवान्॥<br />Thus addressed by the intelligent king about what was beneficial for him, Utanka took leave of the king and set out for the presence of Ahalya.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>गृहीत्वा कुण्डले दिव्ये गुरुपल्याः प्रियंकरः। जवेन महता प्रायाद् गौतमस्याश्रमं प्रति॥<br />Desirous of doing what was agreeable to the wife of his preceptor, he took the ear-rings with him and started with great speed for reaching the hermitage of Gautama.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>यथा तयो रक्षणं च मदयन्त्यभिभाषितम्। तथा ते कुण्डले बद्ध्वा तदा कृष्णाजिनेऽनयत्॥<br />Protecting them even in the manner directed by Madayanti, that is, binding them within the folds of his black, deer-skin, he proceeded on his way.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>स कस्मिंश्चित् क्षुधाविष्टः फलभारसमन्वितम्। बिल्वं ददर्श विप्रर्षिरारुरोह च तं ततः॥<br />After he had proceeded for some distance, he became stricken with hunger. He there saw a Bilva tree covered down with the weight of (ripe) fruits. He climbed that tree.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>शाखामासज्य तस्यैव कृष्णाजिनमरिंदम। पातयामास बिल्वानि तदा स द्विजपुङ्गवः॥<br />Causing his deer-skin, O chastiser of enemies, to hang on a branch, that foremost of twice-born ones, then began to pluck some fruits.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>अथ पातयमानस्य बिल्वापहृतचक्षुषः। न्यपतंस्तानि बिल्वानि तस्मिन्नेवाजिने प्रभो॥ यस्मिंस्ते कुण्डले बद्धे तदा द्विजवरेण वै। बिल्वप्रहारैस्तस्याथ व्यशीर्यद् बन्धनं ततः॥<br />While he was engaged in plucking those fruits with eyes set towards them, some of them dropped, O king, on that deer-skin, in which those ear-rings had been carefully tied by that foremost of Brahmanas. With the strokes of the fruits, the know became loosened.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>सकुण्डलं तदजिनं पपात सहसा तरोः। विशीर्णबन्धने तस्मिन् गते कृष्णाजिने महीम्॥ अपश्यद् भुजगः कश्चित् ते तत्र मणिकुण्डले।<br />Suddenly that deer-skin, with the ear-rings in it, dropped down. When the know being unfastened, the deer-skin fell down on the ground, a snake who was there saw those jewelled ear-rings.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>ऐरावतकुलोद्भूतः शीघ्रो भूत्वा तदा हि सः॥ विदश्यास्येन वल्मीकं विवेशाथ स कुण्डले। ह्रियमाणे तु दृष्ट्वा स कुण्डले भुजगेन ह॥ पपात वृक्षात् सोद्वेगो दुःखात् परमकोपनः। स दण्डकाष्ठमादाय वल्मीकमखनत् तदा॥<br />That snake belonged to the race of Airavata. Promptly he took up the ear-rings in his mouth and then entered an ant-hill. Seeing the ear-rings taken by that snake, Utanka, filled with anger and in great anxiety of mind, came down from the tree. Taking his staff he began to pierce that ant-hill.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>अहानि त्रिंशदव्यग्रः पञ्च चान्यानि भारत। क्रोधामर्षाभिसतंप्तस्तदा ब्राह्मणसत्तमः॥<br />That best of Brahmanas, burning with anger and the desire for revenge, continually busied himself for thirty-five days in that work.</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>तस्य वेगमसा तमसहन्ती वसुन्धरा। दण्डकाष्ठाभिनुन्नाङ्गी चचाल भृशमाकुला॥<br />The goddess Earth, unable to bear the force of Utanka's walking staff and with body torn therewith, became greatly anxious.</p>
<p id='27'><a href='#27'></a>ततः खनत एवाथ विप्रर्धर्धरणीतलम्। नागलोकस्य पन्थानं कर्तुकामस्य निश्चयात्॥ रथेन हरियुक्तेन तं देशमुपजग्मिवान्। वज्रपाणिर्महातेजास्तं ददर्श द्विजोत्तमम्॥<br />To that twice-born Rishi then, who continued to dig the Earth from desire of making a path to the nether regions inhabited by the Nagas, the king of the celestial, armed with the thunder, came there, on his car drawn by green horses. Gifted with great energy, he saw that foremost of Brahmanas, as he sat there engaged in his task.</p>
<p id='28'><a href='#28'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच स तु तं ब्राह्मणो भूत्वा तस्य दुःखेन दुःखितः। उत्तङ्कमब्रवीद् वाक्यं नैतच्छक्यं त्वयेति वै॥<br />Vaishampayana continued : LoO king like a Brahmana stricken with the sorrow of Utanka, the king of the celestials addressed him, saying, 'This (purpose of thine) is impracticable of being accomplished.</p>
<p id='29'><a href='#29'></a>इतो हि नागलोको वै योजनानि सहस्रशः। न दण्डकाष्ठसाध्यं च मन्ये कार्यमिदं तव॥<br />The regions of the Nagas are thousands of Yojanas removed from this place. I think that your purpose is impossible of being achieved with your walking staff.</p>
<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>उत्तङ्क उवाच नागलोके यदि ब्रह्मन् न शक्ये कुण्डले मया। प्राप्तुं प्राणान् विमोक्ष्यामि पश्यतस्तु द्विजोत्तम॥<br />Utanka said If, O Brahmana, the ear-rings be not recovered by me from the regions of the Nagas, I shall renounce my life-breaths before your eyes, O foremost of twice-born persons.</p>
<p id='31'><a href='#31'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच यदा स नाशकत् तस्य निश्चयं कर्तुमन्यथा। वज्रपाणिस्तदा दण्डं वज्रास्त्रेण युयोज ह॥<br />Vaishmpayana said When the thunder-armed Indra could not divert Utanka from his purpose, he united the latter's walking staff with the force of thunder.</p>
<p id='32'><a href='#32'></a>ततो वज्रप्रहारैस्तैर्दार्यमाणा वसुन्धरा। नागलोकस्य पन्थानमकरोज्जनमेजय॥<br />Then, O Janamejaya, the Earth, opening with those strokes having the force of thunder, gave way to the (nether) regions inhabited by the Nagas.</p>
<p id='33'><a href='#33'></a>स तेन मार्गेण तदा नागलोकं विवेश ह। ददर्श नागलोकं च योजनानि सहस्रशः॥<br />By that path Utanka entered the world of Nagas. He saw that that region lying thousands of Yojanas on all sides.</p>

<p id='35'><a href='#35'></a>वापी: स्फटिकसोपाना नदीश्च विमलोदकाः। ददर्श वृक्षांश्च बहून् नानाद्विजगणायुतान्॥<br />There were many flue tanks of water furnished with flights of stair-cases made of pure crystal, and many rivers of clear and transparent water. He saw also many trees with various species of birds perching on them.</p>
<p id='36'><a href='#36'></a>तस्य लोकस्य च द्वारं स ददर्श भृगूद्वहः। पञ्चयोजनविस्तारमायतं शतयोजनम्॥<br />That perpetuator of Bhrigu's race saw the gate of that region which was full five Yojanas high and a hundred Yojanas in width.</p>
<p id='37'><a href='#37'></a>नागलोकमुत्तङ्कस्तु प्रेक्ष्य दीनोऽभवत् तदा। निराशश्चाभवत् तत्र कुण्डलाहरणे पुनः॥<br />Seeing the regions of the Nagas, Utanka became very dispirited. Indeed, he despaired of getting back the ear-rings.</p>

By you I was often adored for the sake of your preceptor, O child of Bhrigu's race, duly and with a pure heart and body. I shall therefore accomplish what is for your will-being.
