How did this gift originate? What are the merits of it? Do you tell me all this.</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। मनोः प्रजापतेर्वादं सुवर्णस्य च भारत॥<br />Bhishma said Regarding it, O Bharata, is recited the old discourse between Manu, that lord of creatures, and Suvarna,</p>
<p id='3'>तपस्वी कश्चिदभवत् सुवर्णो नाम भारत। वर्णतो हेमवर्णः स सुवर्ण इति पप्रथे॥<br />These was formerly an ascetic, O Bharata named Suvarna. His complexion was like that of gold and hence he was called Suvarna.</p>
<p id='4'>कुलशीलगुणोपेतः स्वाध्याये च परंगतः। बहून् सुवंशप्रभवान् समतीतः स्वकैर्गुणैः॥<br />Gifted with good birth, good conduct and good qualities, he had mastered all the Vedas. Indeed, by the accomplishments he possessed, he succeeded in excelling many persons of noble birth.</p>

<p id='7'>तत्र तौ कथयन्तौ स्तां कथा नानाविधाश्रयाः। ब्रह्मर्षिदेवदैत्यानां पुराणानां महात्मनाम्॥<br />Seated there they began to talk with each other on various subjects about the great deities and twiceborn Rishis and Daityas of ancient times.</p>
<p id='8'>सुवर्णस्त्वब्रवीद् वाक्यं मनुं स्वायम्भुवं प्रति। हितार्थं सर्वभूतानां प्रश्न मे वक्तुमर्हसि॥<br />Then Suvarna addressing the Selfcreate Manu, said these words:You should answer one question of mine for the behoof of all creatures.</p>
<p id='9'>सुमनोभिर्यदिज्यन्ते दैवतानि प्रजेश्वर। किमेतत् कथमुत्पन्नं फलं योगे च शंस मे॥<br />O lord of all creatures, the celestials are scen to be adored with presents of flowers and other good scents. What is this? How has this practice come into operation? What also are the merits of it? Do you describe this subject to me.</p>
<p id='10'>मनुरुवाच अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। शुक्रस्य च बलेश्चैव संवादं वै महात्मनोः॥<br />Manu said Regarding it is recited the oid discourse between Shukra and the great (Daitya) Bali.</p>
<p id='11'>बलेवैरोचनस्येह त्रैलोक्यमनुशासतः। समीपमाजगामाशु शुक्रो भृगुकुलोद्वहः॥<br />Once on a time, Shukra of Bhrigu's race approached Bali the son of Virochana while he was ruling the three worlds.</p>

Indeed the king of the Daityas put this high question of Shukra that most learned of all ascetics.</p>
<p id='14'>बलि उवाच सुमनोधूपदीपानां किं फलं ब्रह्मवित्तम। प्रदानस्य द्विजश्रेष्ठ तद् भवान् वक्तुमर्हति॥<br />Bali said O foremost of all persons conversant with Brahma, what, indeed, is the merit of giving flowers and incense and lamps? You should, O foremost of Brahmanas, describe this to me.</p>
<p id='15'>शुक्र उवाच तपः पूर्वं समुत्पन्नं धर्मस्तस्मादनन्तरम्। एतस्मिन्नन्तरे चैव वीरुदोषध्य एव च॥<br />Shukra said Penance first sprang into existence. Afterwards came religion. In the interval many creepers and herbs sprang up.</p>

Some of these creepers and herbs came to be considered as Ambrosia and some came to be considered as Poison. Others that were neither this nor that formed one class.</p>
<p id='17'>अमृतं मनसः प्रीतिं सद्यस्तृप्तिं ददाति च। मनो ग्लपयते तीव्र विषं गन्धेन सर्वशः॥<br />That is Ambrosia which gives immediate pleasure and joy to the mind. That is Poison which tortures the mind greatly by its smell.</p>
