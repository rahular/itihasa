<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 95</h3><h4>The introduction of umbrellas and sandals as gifts of Shraddhas</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच यदिदं श्राद्धकृत्येषु दीयते भरतर्षभ। छत्रं चोपानही चैव केनैतत् सम्प्रवर्तितम्॥ कथं चैतत् समुत्पन्नं किमर्थं चैव दीयते। न केवलं श्राद्धकृत्ये पुण्यकेष्वपि दीयते॥ बहुष्वपि निमित्तेषु पुण्यमाश्रित्य दीयते। एतद् विस्तरशो ब्रह्मन् श्रोतुमिच्छामि तत्त्वतः॥<br />Yudhishthira said O chief of Bharata's race. by whom was the custom of giving umbrellas and sandals at Shraddhas introduced? Why was it introduced and for what purpose are those gifts made? They are given not only at Shraddhas, but also at other religious rites. They are given on many occasions with the view of winning religious merit. I wish to know, in full, O twiceborn one, the true meaning of this practice.</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच शृणु राजन्नवहितश्छत्रोपानहविस्तरम्। यथैतत् प्रथितं लोके यथा चैतत् प्रवर्तितम्॥<br />Bhishma said Do you, O prince, attentively listen to the details I shall recite about the custom of giving away umbrellas and shocs at religious rites, and as to how and by whom it was introduced.</p>
<p id='3'>यथा चाक्षय्यतां प्राप्तं पुण्यतां च यथा गतम्। सर्वमेतदशेषेण प्रवक्ष्यामि नराधिप॥<br />I shall also tell you in full, O prince, how it acquired the force of a permanent observance and how it came to be considered as a meritorious act.</p>
<p id='4'>जमदग्नेश्च संवादं सूर्यस्य च महात्मनः। पुरा स भगवान् साक्षाद्धनुषाक्रीडयत् प्रभो॥<br />I shall in this connection, recite the conversation between Jamadagni and the great Sun. Formerly the illustrious Jamadagni, O powerful king, of Bhrigu's race, was engaged in practising with his bow.</p>
<p id='5'>संधाय संधाय शरांश्चिक्षेप किल भार्गवः। तान् क्षिप्तान् रेणुका सर्वांस्तस्येषून्दीप्ततेजसः॥ आनीय सा तदा तस्मै प्रादादसकृदच्युत। अथ तेन स शब्देन ज्यायाश्चैव शरस्य च॥ प्रहृष्टः सम्प्रचिक्षेप सा च प्रत्याजहार तान्। ततो मध्याह्नमारूढे ज्येष्ठामूले दिवाकरे॥ स सायकान् द्विजो मुक्त्वा रेणुकामिदमब्रवीत्। गच्छानय विशालाक्षि शरानेतान् धनुश्च्युतान्॥<br />Taking his aim, he shot arrow after arrow. His wife Renuka used to pick up the arrows when he shot and repeatedly bring them back to that descendant, gifted with the burning energy of Bhrigu's race. pleased with the whizzing noise of his arrows and the twang of his bow, he amused himself thus by repeatedly shooting his arrows which Renuka brought back to him, One day, at noontide, O monarch, was in that month when the Sun in Jyesthamula, the Brahmana, having shot all his arrows, said to Renuka, O largeeyed lady, go and fetch me the arrows I have shot from my bow.</p>
<p id='6'>यावदेतान् पुनः सुभ्र क्षिपामीति जनाधिए। सा गच्छन्त्यन्तरा छायां वृक्षमाश्रित्य भामिनी॥ तस्थौ तस्या हि सन्तप्तं शिरः पादौ तथैव च। स्थिता सा तु मुहूर्तं वै भर्तुः शापभयाच्छुभा॥ ययावानयितुं भूयः सायकानसितेक्षणा। प्रत्याजगाम च शरांस्तानादाय यशस्विनी॥ सा वै खिन्ना सुचार्वङ्गी पद्भ्यां दुःखं नियच्छती। उपाजगाम भर्तारं भयाद् भर्तुः प्रवेपती॥<br />O you of beautiful eyebrows, I shall again shoot them with my bow! The lady proceeded on her errand but was compelled to sit under the shade of a tree, on account of her head and feet being scorched by the heat of the Sun. The black eyed and graceful Renuka, having rested for only a moment, feared the curse of her husband and, therefore began to collect and bring back the arrows. Taking them with her, the celebrated lady of beautiful features came back, distressed in mind and her feet smarting with pain. Trembling with fear, she approached her husband.</p>
<p id='7'>सतामृषिस्तदा क्रुद्वो वाक्यमाह शुभाननाम्। रेणुके किं चिरेण त्वमागतेति पुनः पुनः॥<br />The Rishis, stricken with anger, repeatedly addressed his fairfaced wife, saying, O Renuka, why have you been so late in returning?</p>
<p id='8'>रेणुकोवाच शिरस्तावत् प्रदीप्तं मे पादौ चैव तपोधन। सूर्यतेजोनिरुद्धाऽहं वृक्षच्छायां समाश्रिता॥<br />Renuka said O you, having penances for wealth, my hand and feet were scorched by the rays of the Sun! Oppressed by the heat, I took shelter under the shade of a tree!</p>
<p id='9'>एतस्मात् कारणाद् ब्रह्मश्चिरायैतत् कृतं मया। एतच्छ्रुत्वा मम विभो मा क्रुधस्त्वं तपोधन॥<br />with me. This . has been the cause of the delay! Informed of the cause, do you, O lord, cease to be angry</p>
<p id='10'>जमदग्निरुवाच अद्यैनं दीप्तकिरणं रेणुके तव दुःखदम्। शरैर्निपातयिष्यामि सूर्यमस्त्राग्नितेजसा॥<br />Jamadagni said O Renuka, this very day shall I destroy, with the fiery energy of my weapons, the star of the day with his burning rays, who has afflicted you thus.</p>
<p id='11'>भीष्म उवाच स विस्फार्य धनुर्दिव्यं गृहीत्वा च शरान् बहून्। अतिष्ठत् सूर्यमभितो यतो याति ततो मुखः॥<br />Bhishma said Drawing his celestial bow, and taking up many arrows, Jamadagni stood, turning his face towards the Sun and watching him as he moved on.</p>
<p id='12'>अथ तं प्रेक्ष्य सन्नद्धं सूर्योऽभ्येत्य तथाब्रवीत्। द्विजरूपेण कौन्तेय किं ते सूर्योऽपराध्यते॥<br />Then O son of Kunti, seeing him ready for fight, the Sun approached him in the guise of a Brahmana, and said to him, What has the Sun done to offend you?</p>
<p id='13'>आदत्ते रश्मिभिः सूर्यो दिवि तिष्ठंस्ततस्ततः। रसं हृतं वै वर्षासु प्रवर्षति दिवाकरः॥<br />Passing through the sky, he draws up the moisture from the Earth and in the form of rains he pours it down once more on her.</p>
<p id='14'>ततोऽन्नं जायते विप्र मनुष्याणां सुखावहम्। अन्नं प्राणा इति यथा वेदेषु परिपठ्यते॥<br />It is through this, O twiceborn one, that the food of human beings springs up, food that is so agreeable to them! The Vedas say that it is food that forms the vital airs.</p>
<p id='15'>अथाभ्रेषु निगूढच रश्मिभिः परिवारितः। सप्तद्वीपानिमान् ब्रह्मन् वर्षेणाभिप्रवर्षति॥<br />O Brahmana, hidden in the clouds and encompassed by his rays, the Sun drenches the seven insular continents with showers of rain.</p>
<p id='16'>ततस्तदौषधीनां च वीस्थां पुष्पपत्रजम्। सर्वं वर्षाभिनिवृत्तमनं सम्भवति प्रभो॥<br />O powerful one, the moisture, thus poured, spreading itself into the leaves and fruits of vegetables and herbs, is changed into food.</p>
<p id='17'>जातकर्माणि सर्वाणि व्रतोपनयनानि च। गोदानानि विवाहाश्च तथा यज्ञसमृद्धयः॥ शास्त्राणि दानानि तथा संयोगा वित्तसंचयाः। अन्नतः सम्प्रवर्तन्ते तथा त्वं वेत्थ भार्गव॥<br />O son of Bhrigu, the rites consequent on birth, religious observances, investiture with the sacred thread, gifts of kine, marriage, all articles in view of sacrifices, the rules for the governance of men, gifts all sorts of union, and the acquisition of riches, originate from food! You know this well!</p>
<p id='18'>रमणीयानि यावन्ति यावदारम्भिकाणि च। सर्वमन्नात् प्रभवति विदितं कीर्तयामि ते॥<br />All the good and sweet things in the universe, and all the efforts made by living creatures, originate from food. I duly recite what is well known to you! Indeed, you fully know all that I have said.</p>
<p id='19'>सर्वं हि वेत्थ विप्र त्वं यदेतत् कीर्तितं मया। प्रसादये त्वां विप्रर्षे किं ते सूर्य निपात्य वै॥<br />Do you therefore, O twiceborm Rishi, appease your anger! What will you gain by annihilating the Sun?</p>
