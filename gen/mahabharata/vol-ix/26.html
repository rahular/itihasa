<p id='80'>दक्षां पृश्निं बृहती विप्रकृष्टां शिवामृद्धां भागिनी सुप्रसन्नाम्। विभावरी सर्वभूतप्रतिष्ठा गङ्गां गता ये त्रिदिवं गतास्ते॥<br />Ganga is regarded as competent to rescue every creature from sin and lead him to the happiness of Heaven. She is held to be at one with Prishni the mother of Vishnu. She is identical with the Word or Speech. She is very remote and can not be easily attained. She is the embodiment of auspiciousness, and prosperity. She is capable granting the six wellknown attributes beginning with lordship or power. She is always bent upon showing her grace. She is the displayer of all things in the universe, and she is the great resort of all creatures. Those who seek her protection in this life have surely acquired heaven.</p>
<p id='81'>ख्यातिर्यस्याः खं दिवंगां च नित्यं पुरा दिशो विदिशश्चावतस्थे। तस्या जलं सेव्य सरिद्वराया माः सर्वे कृतकृत्या भवन्ति॥<br />The fame of Ganga has spread all over the sky, and Heaven, and Earth, and all the points, cardinal and subsidiary, of the compass. By using the waters of that foremost of rivers, mortal creatures always become crowned with high success.</p>
<p id='82'>इयं गङ्गेति नियतं प्रतिष्ठा गुहस्य रुक्मस्य च गर्भयोषा। प्रातस्त्रिवर्गा घृतवहा विपाप्मा गङ्गावतीर्णा वियतो विश्वतोया॥<br />That person who, himself seeing Ganga, points her out to others, finds that Ganga rescues him from rebirth and confers Liberation on him. Ganga held Guha, the commander-in-chief of the celestial army in her womb. She bears the most precious of all metals, viz., gold, also in that womb of hers. They who bathe in her waters every day in the morning, succeed in obtaining the three-fold objects, viz., Virtue and Wordly Profit and Pleasure. Those waters are, again, equal in point of sanctity to the butter that is poured with Mantras on the sacrificial fire. Capable of purging one from every sin, she has descended from the celestial region and her current is held in high regard by every one.</p>
<p id='83'>सुतावनीध्रस्य हरस्य भार्या दिवो भुवश्चापि कृतानुरूपा। भव्या पृथिव्यां भागिनी चापि राजन् गङ्गा लोकानां पुण्यदा वै त्रयाणाम्॥<br />Ganga is the daughter of Himavat, the wife of Hara, and the ornament of both Heaven and Earth. She is the bestower of everything auspicious, and is competent to give the six well known attributes beginning with lordship or power. Indeed, O king, Ganga is the one object of great sanctity in the three worlds and confers merit upon all.</p>
<p id='84'>महोर्मिभिः शोभिता ब्राह्मणैश्च। दिवश्च्युता शिरसाऽऽप्ता शिवेन गङ्गावनीध्रात त्रिदिवस्य माता॥<br />Truly, O king, Ganga is Virtue in liquefied i form. She is energy in a liquid forin over the Earth. She is gifted with the splendour or power that belongs to the butter that is poured with Mantras on the sacrificial fire. She is always adorned with large waves as also with Brahmanas who may at all times be seen making their ablutions in her waters. Falling from Heaven, she was held by Shiva on his head. The very mother of the heavens, she has originated from the highest mountain for running over the plains and conferring the most valuable benefits on all creatures of the Earth.</p>
<p id='85'>योनिर्वरिष्ठा विरजा वितन्वी शय्याचिरा वारिवहा यशोदा। विश्वावती चाकृतिरिष्टसिद्धा गङ्गोक्षितानां भुवनस्य पन्थाः॥<br />She is the highest cause of all things; she is perfectly pure. She is as subtile as Brahma. She is the best bed for the dying. She takes creatures speedily to the celestial region. She carries a large volume of water. She confers great fame on all. She is the protectress of the universe. She is at one with every forin. She is very much coveted by persons crowned with success. Indeed, Ganga is the path to that celestial region of those who have bathed in her water.</p>
<p id='86'>क्षान्त्या मह्या गोपने धारणेच दीप्त्या कृशानोस्तपनस्य चैव। तुल्या गङ्गा सम्मता ब्राह्मणानां गुहस्य ब्रह्मण्यतया च नित्यम्॥<br />The Brahmanas consider Ganga as being equal to the Earth in forgiveness, and in the protection and upholding of those who live by her, further, as equalling Fire and the Sun in energy and splendour; and, lastly, as always equalling Guha himself in the matter of showing favours to the trueborn class.</p>
<p id='87'>ऋषिष्टुतां विष्णुपदी पुराणां सुपुण्यतोयां मनसापि लोके। स्ते ब्रह्मणः सदनं सम्प्रयाताः॥<br />Those men who, in the life, even in their minds seek that sacred river which is lauded by the Rishis, which has come out of the feet of Vishnu, which is very ancient, and which is highly sacred succeed in going to the regions of Brahman.</p>
<p id='88'>लोकानवेक्ष्य जननीव पुत्रान् सर्वात्मना सर्वगुणोपपन्नान्। गङ्गा सदैवात्मवशरूपास्या॥<br />Fully convinced that children and other belongings, as also regions possessed of every kind of happiness, are transitory or frail, men of subdued souls, who are desirous of acquiring that everlasting station which is at one with Brahina, always pay their adorations to Ganga with that respect and love which are due from a son to a mother.</p>
<p id='89'>मिरावतीं धारिणी भूधराणाम्। शिष्टाश्रयाममृतां ब्रह्मकान्तां गङ्गां श्रयेदात्मवान् सिद्धिकामः॥<br />The man of purified soul who is desirous of acquiring success should seek the protection of Ganga who is like a cow that gives ambrosia instead of ordinary milk, who is prosperity's self, who is endued with omniscience, who exists for all creatures, who is the source of all sorts of food, who is the mother of all mountains, who is the refuge of all pious persons, who is immeasurable in power and energy and who charms the heart of Brahman himself.</p>
<p id='90'>प्रसाद्य देवान् सविभून् समस्तान् भगीरथस्तपसोग्रेण गङ्गाम्। गामानयत् तामभिगम्य शश्वत् पुंसां भयं नेह चामुत्र विद्यात्॥<br />Having, with austere penances, pleased all the gods with the Supreme Lord (Vishnu), Bhagiratha brought Ganga down on the Earth. Going to her, men always succeed in freeing themselves from every sort of fear both here and hereafter.</p>
<p id='91'>उदाहतः सर्वथा ते गुणानां मयैकदेशः प्रसमीक्ष्य बुद्ध्या। शक्तिर्न मे काचिदिहास्ति वक्तुं गुणान् सर्वान् परिमातुं तथैव॥<br />Observing with the help of intelligence, I have mentioned to you only a small portion of the merits of Ganga. My power, however, is inadequate to speak of all the merits of the sacred river, or indeed, to measure her power and sanctity.</p>
<p id='92'>मेरो: समुद्रस्य च सर्वयत्नैः संख्योपलानामुदकस्य वापि। शक्यं वक्तुं नेह गङ्गाजलानां गुणाख्यानं परिमातुं तथैव॥<br />One may, displaying his best powers, count the stones of the mountain Meru or measure the waters of the ocean. But one cannot count all the merits of the waters of Ganga.</p>
<p id='93'>तस्मादेतान् परया श्रद्धयोक्तान् गुणान् सर्वान् जाह्नवीयान् सदैव। भवेद् वाचा मनसा कर्मणा च भक्त्या युक्तः श्रद्धया श्रद्दधानः॥<br />Hence, having listened to these particular merits of Ganga which I have uttered with great devotion, one should in thought, word and deed, respect them with faith and devotion.</p>
<p id='94'>लोकानिमांस्त्रीन् यशसा वितत्य सिद्धिं प्राप्य महतीं तां दुरापाम्। गङ्गाकृतानचिरेणैव लोकान् यथेष्टमिष्टान् विहरिष्यसि त्वम्॥<br />On account of your having listened to those merits which I have recounted, you are sure to fill all the three regions with fame and acquire a measure of success that is very large and that is difficult of being won by any other person. Indeed, you will soon after that, sport in joy in many a region of great happiness created by Ganga herself for those that respect her.</p>
<p id='95'>तव मम च गुणैर्महानुभावा जुषतु मतिं सततं स्वधर्मयुक्तः। अभिमतजनवत्सला हि गङ्गा जगति युनक्ति सुखैश्च भक्तिमन्तम्॥<br />Ganga always extends her favour to those who are devoted to her in huinbleness of heart. She unites those who are so devoted to her with every kind of happiness. I pray that the highly blessed Ganga may always inspire your heart and mine with the attributes of virtue.</p>
<p id='96'>भीष्म उवाच शिलरतये त्रिपथानुयोगरूपान्। बहुविधमनुशास्य तथ्यरूपान् गगनतलं द्युतिमान् विवेश सिद्धः॥<br />Bhishma said The learned ascetic gifted with high soul and great slendour and crowned with success having in this manner described to that poor Brahmana observing the Shila vow, on the subject of the infinite merits of Ganga, then ascended the sky.</p>
