Did you know any woman before the cessation of her menses? Have you killed a Brahmana?</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>युद्धे पराजितो वासि गतश्रीरिव लक्ष्यसे। न त्वां प्रभिन्नं जानामि किमिदं भरतर्षभ॥ श्रोतव्यं चेन्मया पार्थ क्षिप्रमाख्यातुमर्हसि।<br />Have you been defeated in battle? You look like one shorn of prosperity! I do not know that you have been defeated by any one. Why then, O chief Bharata's race, this exceedingly dejected look! You should O of Pritha, tell me all, if, indeed, there be no harm in telling it.</p>

<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>बभूव वीरान्तकरः प्रभासे लोमहर्षणः। एते शूरा महात्मानः सिंहदर्पा महाबलाः॥<br />At Prabhasa, through iron bolts caused by the curse denounced by Brahmanas, the destruction has taken place of the Vrishni heroes. That destruction has been awful and not even a single hero has escaped,</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>भोजवृष्ण्यन्धका ब्रह्मन्नन्योन्यं तैर्हतं युधि। गदापरिघशक्तीनां सहाः परिघबाहवः॥ त एरकाभिर्निहताः पश्य कालस्य पर्ययम्। हतं पञ्चशतं तेषां सहस्रं बाहुशालिनाम्॥ निधनं समनुप्राप्तं समासाद्येतरेतरम्।<br />The heroes of the Bhoja, the Andhaka, and the Vrishni races, O Brahmana, who were all gifted with high-souls, great might, and leonine pride, have killed one another in battle. Possessed of arms which looked like maces of iron, and capable of bearing the strokes of heavy clubs and darts, alas they have all been killed with blades of Eraka grass. See the perverse course of Time. Five hundred thousand mighty-armed warriors have thus been killed. Encountering one another, they have met with destruction.</p>

Deprived of the company of the Vrishni heroes, I wish not to live in this world.</p>

Alas, reft of Govinda, what have I to live for, dragging my life in sorrow?</p>
