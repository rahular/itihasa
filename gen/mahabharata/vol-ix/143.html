<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 143</h3><h4>Religion and profit, which bring on happiness in the next world. The history of Rudra and Uma</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>उमोवाच भगवन् भगनेत्रन पूष्णो दन्तिनिपातन। दक्षक्रतुहर त्र्यक्ष संशयो मे महानयम्॥<br />Uma said O Holy one, O you who had torn off the cyes of Bhaga and the teeth of Pushan, O destroyer of the sacrifice of Daksha, O threecyed deity, I have a great doubt.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>चातुर्वण्र्यं भगवता पूर्वं सृष्टं स्वयम्भुवा। केन कर्मविपाकेन वैश्यो गच्छति शूद्रताम्॥<br />Forinerly, the illustrious self-create created the four castes. Through the evil result of what deeds does a Vaishya became a Shudra?</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>वैश्यो वा क्षत्रियः केन द्विजो वा क्षत्रियो भवेत्। प्रतिलोमः कथं देव शक्यो धर्मो निवर्तितुम्॥<br />Through, what acts does a Kshatriya become a Vaishya and a Brahmana becomes a Kshatriya? By what means may such degradation of castes bc warded off?</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>केन वा कर्मणा विप्रः शूद्रयोनौ प्रजायते। क्षत्रियः शूद्रतामेति केन वा कर्मणा विभो॥<br />Through what deeds' does a Brahmana take birth in his next life, in the Shudra caste? Through what acts, O powerful deity, does a Kshatriya also come down to the status of a Shudra?</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>एतन्मे संशयं देव तवद भूतपतेऽनघ। त्रयो वर्णाः प्रकृत्येह कथं ब्राह्मण्यमाप्नुयुः॥<br />O sinless one, O lord of all created beings, do you, O illustrious one, remove this doubt of mine. How, again can the three castes naturally succeed in acquiring the status Brahmanahood?</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>श्रीमहेश्वर उवाच ब्राह्मण्यं देवि दुष्प्रापं निसर्गाद् ब्राह्मणः शुभे। क्षत्रियो वैश्यशूद्रौ वा निसर्गादिति मे मतिः॥<br />The Illustrious One said The status of a Brahmana, O goddess is highly difficult to attain. O auspicious lady, one becomes a Brahmana through creation or birth. Similarly the Kshatriya, the Vaishya, and the Shudra, all becomes so through original creation. This is my opinion.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>कर्मणा दुष्कृतेनेह स्थानाद् भ्रश्यति वै द्विजः। ज्येष्ठं वर्णमनुप्राप्य तस्माद् रक्षेद् वै द्विजः॥<br />He, however, that is born a Brahmana goes down from his status through his own evil deeds. Hence, the Brahmana, after having acquired the status of the first order, should always protect it.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>स्थितो ब्राह्मणधर्मेण ब्राह्मण्यमुपजीवति। क्षत्रियो वाथ वैश्यो वा ब्रह्मभूयं स गच्छति॥<br />If one who is a Kshatriya or Vaishya performs those duties which are assigned to the Brahmana, after the manner of a Brahmana, he becomes a Brahman.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>यस्तु विप्रत्वमुत्सृज्य क्षात्रं धर्मं निषेवते। ब्राह्मण्यात् स परिभ्रष्टः क्षत्रयोनौ प्रजायते॥<br />That Brahmana who renounces the duties of his order for following those of the Kshatriya, is considered as one who has fallen away from the status of a Brahmana and who has become a Kshatriya.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>वैश्यकर्म च यो विप्रो लोभमोहव्यपाश्रयः। ब्राह्मण्यं दुर्लभं प्राप्य करोत्यमल्पमतिः सदा॥ स द्विजो वैश्यतामेति वैश्यो वा शूद्रतामियात्। स्वधर्मात् प्रच्युतो विप्रस्ततः शूद्रत्वमाप्नुते॥<br />That little-witted Brahmana, who, moved by cupidity and folly, follows the practices assigned to Vaishyas, forgetful of his position as a Brahmana that is highly difficult to attain, comes to be considered as one who has become a Vaishya. Likewise, one who is a Vaishya by birth may, by following the practices of a Shudra, become a Shudra. Indeed, a Brahmana falling away from the duties of his own order. may go down to the status of even a Shudra.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>तत्रासौ निरयं प्राप्तो वर्णभ्रष्टो बहिष्कृतः। ब्रह्मलोकात् परिभ्रष्टः शूद्रः समुपजायते॥<br />Such a Brahmana, degraded from the order of his birth and outcasted, without attaining to the region of Brahman, sinks into Hell, and in his next birth becomes born as a Shudra.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>क्षत्रियो वा महाभागे वैश्यो वा धर्मचारिणि। स्वानि कर्माण्यपाहाय शूद्रकर्म निषेवते॥ स्वस्थानात् स परिभ्रष्टो वर्णसंकरतां गतः। ब्राह्मणः क्षत्रियो वैश्यः शूद्रत्वं याति तादृशः॥<br />A highly blessed Kshatriya or a Vaishya, who renounces the duties of his order, and follows the practices of a Shudra, falls away from his own order and becomes a person of mixed caste. It is in this way that a Brahmana, or a Kshatriya, or a Vaishya, comes by the position of a Shudra.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>यस्तु बुद्धः स्वधर्मेण ज्ञानविज्ञानवाशुचिः। धर्मज्ञो धर्मनिरतः स धर्मफलमश्नुते॥<br />That man who has acquired clearness of vision through practice of the duties of his own casic, who is gifted with knowledge and science, who is pure (in body and inind), who knows every duty and is devoted to the practice of all his duties, is sure to enjoy the rewards of virtue.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>इदं चैवापरं देवि ब्रह्मणा समुदाहृतम्। अध्यात्मं नैष्टिकं सद्भिर्धर्मकामैनिषेव्यते॥<br />I shall now recite to you, O goddess, a saying uttered by Brahman on this subject. The virtuous and those who are desirous of acquiring mcrit always pursue with firmness the culture of the soul.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>उग्रानं गर्हितं देवि गणान्नं श्राद्धसूतकम्। दुष्टानं नैव भोक्तव्यं शूद्रान्नं नैव कर्हिचित्॥<br />The food that comes from cruel and fierce persons is censurable. So also is the food that has been cooked for serving a large number of persons. The same is said of the food that is cooked for the first Shraddha of a dead person. So also is the food that is sullied for the usual faults and the food that is supplied by a Shudra. These should never be taken by a Brahmana at any time.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>शूद्रान्नं गर्हितं देवि सदा देवैर्महात्मभिः। पितामहमुखोत्सृष्टं प्रमाणमिति मे मतिः॥<br />The food of a Shudra, O goddess, is always disapproved of by the great deities. This, I think, is the authority enunciated by the Grandfather with his own mouth.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>शूद्रान्नेनावशेषेण जठरे या म्रियेद् द्विजः। आहिताग्निस्तथा यज्वा स शूद्रगतिभाग् भवेत्॥<br />If a Brahmana, who has set up the sacred fire and who performs sacrifices, were to die with any portion of a Shudra's food remaining undigested in his stomach, he is sure to be born a Shudra.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>तेन शूद्रानशेषेण ब्रह्मस्थानादपाकृतः। ब्राह्मणः शूद्रतामेति नास्ति तत्र विचारणा॥<br />On account of those remains of a Shudra's food in his stomach, he falls away from the position of a Brahmana. Such a Brahmana becomes surely a Shudra.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>यस्यान्नेनावशेषेण जठरे यो म्रियेद् द्विजः। तां तां योनि व्रजेद् विप्रो यस्यान्नमुपजीवति॥<br />The Brahmana in his next life comes by the position of that order upon whose food he lives through life or with the undigested portion of whose food in his stomach he dies.</p>

<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>गुरुतल्पी गुरुद्रोही गुरुकुत्सारतिश्च यः। ब्रह्मविच्चापि पतति ब्राह्मणो ब्रह्मयोनितः॥<br />That Brahmana who violates the bed of his preceptor, or who takes a pleasure in speaking ill of him, falls away from the status of Brahmanahood even if he knows Brahma.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>एभिस्तु कर्मभिर्देवि शुभैराचरितैस्तथा। शूद्रो ब्राह्मणतां याति वैश्यः क्षत्रियतां व्रजेत्॥<br />By these good deeds again, O goddess, when performed, a Shudra becomes Brahmana, and Vaishya becomes Kshatriya.</p>

If a Vaishya wishes to be a Brahmana (in his next life), he should perform these duties. He should be truthful in speech, and shorn of pride or arrogance. He should be above all pairs of opposites. He should observe the duties of peace and tranquility.</p>
