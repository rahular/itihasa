<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>तस्य सर्वस्य विधिवद् विधानमुपदिश्यते। शृणु मे गदतो भद्रे रहस्यमिदमद्भुतम्॥<br />The ordinances are now being duly declared in full. Listen to me, O fair lady, as I describe this wonderful mystery.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>करणं कर्म कर्ता च मोक्ष इत्येव भाविनि। चत्वार एते होतारो यैरिदं जगदावृतम्॥<br />The instrument, the action, the agent and liberation. These, O beautiful lady, are the four sacrificing pricsts by whom the universe is covered.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>हेतूनां साधनं चैव शृणु सर्वमशेषतः घ्राणं जिह्वा च चक्षुश्च त्वक् च श्रोत्रं च पञ्चमम्। मनो बुद्धिश्च सप्तैते विज्ञेया गुणहेतवः॥ गन्धो रसच रूपं च शब्दः स्पर्शश्च पञ्चमः। मन्तव्यमथ बोद्धव्यं सप्तैते कर्महेतवः॥ घ्राता भक्षयिता द्रष्टा वक्ता श्रोता च पञ्चमः। मन्ता बोद्धा च सप्तैते विज्ञेयाः कर्तृहेतवः॥ स्वगुणं भक्षयन्त्येते गुणवन्तः शुभाशुभम्।<br />Hear fully of causes. The noise, the tongue, the eye, the skin, the ear for the fifth, the mind and the understanding, these seven should be understood as the causes of qualities. Smell, taste, colour, sound, touch, numbering the fifth, the objects of the mind, and the objects of the understanding, these are the seven causes of action. He who smells, he who eats, he who sees, he who speaks, he who hears, numbering the lifth, he who thinks, and he who understands, these seven should be known as the causes of action. Endued with qualitics, these enjoy their own qualities, agrecable or disagrecable.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>अहं च निर्गुणोऽनन्तः सप्तैते मोक्षहेतवः॥ विदुषां बुध्यमानानां स्वं स्वं स्थानं यथाविधि। गुणास्ते देवताभूताः सततं भुञ्जते हविः॥ अदन्नन्नान्यथोऽविद्वान् ममत्वेनोपपद्यते।<br />As regards the soul, that is destitute of qualities. These seven are the causes of Liberation. With them who are learned and gifted with sufficient understanding, the qualities, which are in the position of celestials, eat the oblations, each in its proper place, and according to what has been ordained. The person who is shorn of learning, eating various kinds of food, becomes seized with the sense of egoism.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>आत्मार्थं पाचयन्ननं ममत्वेनोपहन्यते॥ अभक्ष्यभक्षणं चैव मद्यपानं च हन्ति तम्।<br />Digesting food for himself, he becomes ruined through the sense of egoism. The cating of food that should not be caten and the drinking of wine, ruin him.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>स चानं हन्ति तं चान्नं स हत्वा हन्यते पुनः॥ हन्ता ह्यन्नमिदं विद्वान् पुनर्जनयतीश्वरः।<br />He destroys the food (lic takes), and having destroyed that food he becomes destroyed himself. The learned man, however, giſted with power, destroys his food for reproducing it.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>न चान्नाज्जायते तस्मिन् सूक्ष्मो नाम व्यतिक्रमः॥ मनसा गम्यते यच्च यच्च वाचा निगद्यते। श्रोत्रेण श्रूयते यच्च चक्षुषा यच्च दृश्यते॥ स्पर्शेन स्पृश्यते यच्च घ्राणेन घ्रायते च यत्। मनःषष्ठानि संयम्य हवींष्येतानि सर्वशः॥ गुणवत्पावको मह्यं दीव्यतेऽत:शरीरगः।<br />The minutest sin does not arise in him from the food he takes. Whatever is thought of by the mind, whatever is uttered by words, whatever is heard by the ear, whatever is seen by the eye, whatever is touched by touch, whatever is smelt by the nosc, form oblations of clarified butter which should all, after controlling the senses with the mind numbering the sixth, be poured into that fire of high merits which burns within the body viz., the Soul.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>योगयज्ञः प्रवृत्ते मे ज्ञानवह्निप्रदोद्भवः। प्राणस्तोत्रोऽपानशस्त्रः सर्वत्यागसुदक्षिणः॥<br />The sacrifices formed by Yoga is going on as regards myself. The spring whence that sacrifice proceeds is that which gives the fire of knowledge. The upward vital air Prana is the Stotra of that sacrifice. The downward vital air Apana is its Shastra. The renunciation of everything is the excellent present of that sacrifice.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>कर्तानुमन्ता ब्रह्मात्मा होताध्वर्युः कृतस्तुतिः। ऋतं प्रशास्ता तच्छस्त्रमपवर्गोऽस्य दक्षिणा॥<br />Consciousness, Mind, and Understanding, which are all Brahma, are its Hotri, Adhvaryu, and Udgatri. The Prashastri, his Shastra, is truth. Cessation of separate existence (or Emancipation) is the Honorarium.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>ऋचश्चाप्यत्र शंसन्ति नारायणविदो जनाः। नारायणाय देवाय यदविन्दन् पशून् पुरा॥<br />People conversant with Narayana, recite some Richs on this subject. Formerly animals were offered to the divine Narayana.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>तत्र सामानि गायन्ति तत्र चाहुर्निदर्शनम्। देवं नारायणं भीरु सर्वात्मानं निबोध तम्॥<br />Then are sung some Samans. There is an authority on this subject. O timid one, know that the divine Narayana is the Soul of all.</p>
