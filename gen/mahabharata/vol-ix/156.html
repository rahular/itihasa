<h3>None: Chapter 156</h3><h4>Superiority of the Brahmanas over the Element</h4><p id='1'>इत्युक्तस्त्वर्जुनस्तूष्णीमभूद् वायुस्तमब्रवीत्। शृणु मे हैहयश्रेष्ठ कर्मात्रेः सुमहात्मनः॥<br />Bhishma said Thus addressed, Arjuna remained silent. The god of wind once more addressed him, saying, Hear me, O foremost one of the Haihayas, as I describe to you the achicvement of the great Atri.</p>
<p id='2'>घोरे तमस्ययुध्यन्त सहिता देवदानवाः। अविध्यत शरैस्तत्र स्वर्भानुः सोमभास्करौ॥<br />Once on a time as the gods and Danavas were fighting each other in the dark, Rahu pierced both the Sun and Moon with his arrows.</p>
<p id='3'>अथ ते तमसा ग्रस्ता निहन्यन्ते स्म दानवैः। देवा नृपतिशार्दूल सहैव बलिभिस्तदा॥<br />The gods, overwhelmed by darkness, began to fall before the powerful Danavas, O foremost of kings.</p>
<p id='4'>असुरैर्वध्यमानास्ते क्षीणप्राणा दिवौकसः। अपश्यन्त तपस्यन्तमत्रिं विप्रं तपोधनम्॥ अथैनमब्रुवन् देवाः शान्तक्रोधं जितेन्द्रियम्। असुरैरिषुभिर्विद्धौ चन्द्रादित्याविमावुभौ॥<br />Repeatedly struck by the Asuras, the celestials began to lose their strength. They then saw the learned Brahmana Atri, having penances for wealth, engaged in in the observance of austerities. Addressing that Rishi who had all his senses and in whom anger had been extinguished, they said, Sce, O Rishi, these two, viz., the Moon and the Sun who have both been pierced by the Asuras with their arrows.</p>
<p id='5'>वयं वध्यामहे चापि शत्रुभिस्तमसावृते। नाधिगच्छाम शान्तिं च भयात् त्रायस्व नः प्रभो॥<br />On account of this, darkness has overtaken us, and we are being struck down by the enemy. We do not see the end of our troubles. Do you, O lord of great power, rescue us from this great fear.</p>
<p id='6'>ऋषि उवाच कथं रक्षामि भवतस्तेऽब्रुवंश्चन्द्रमा भव। तिमिरन्धश्च सवितस दस्युहन्ता च नो भव॥<br />The Rishi said How, indeed, shall I protect you? They answered, saying, Do you become the Moon. Do you also become the Sun, and do you begini to kill these robbers.</p>
<p id='7'>एवमुक्तस्तदात्रिर्व तमोनुदभवच्छशी। अपश्यत् सौम्यभावाच्च सोमवत् प्रियदर्शनः॥<br />Thus begged by them, Atri assumed the form of the darknessdestroying Moon. Indeed, on account of his agreeable disposition, he began to look as beautiful and delightful as the Moon himself.</p>
<p id='8'>दृष्ट्वा नातिप्रभं सोमं तथा सूर्यं च पार्थिव। प्रकाशमकरोदत्रिस्तपसा स्वेन संयुगे॥<br />Seeing that the real Moon and the real Sun had become darkened by the arrows of the enemy, Atri, assuming the forms of those luminaries, began to shine forth over the field of battle, helped by the power of his penances.</p>
<p id='9'>जगद् वितिमिरं चापि प्रदीप्तमकरोत् तदा॥<br />Indeed, Atri made the universe shine in light, removing all its darkness. By displaying his power, he also subjugated, the vast multitudes of those enemies of the celestials.</p>
<p id='10'>व्यजयच्छत्रुसंघांश्च देवानां स्वेन तेजसा। अत्रिणा दह्यमानांस्तान् दृष्ट्वा देवा महासुरान्॥<br />Seeing those great Asuras burnt by Atri, the gods also, protected by Atri's energy, began to despatch them quickly.</p>
<p id='11'>पराक्रमैस्तेऽपि तदा व्यनन्नत्रिसुरक्षिताः। उद्भासितश्च सविता देवास्त्राता हतासुराः॥<br />Displaying his prowess and collecting all his energy, it was thus that Atri illumined the god of day, rescued the celestials, and killed the Asuras.</p>
<p id='12'>अत्रिणा त्वथ सामर्थ्य कृतमुत्तमतेजसा। द्विजेनाग्निद्वितीयेन जपता चर्मवाससा॥<br />This was the feat that twice born one, helped by his sacred fire, that silent reciter of Mantras, that one clad in deerskins, performed! See, O royal sage, the act achieved by that Rishi who lived upon fruits only.</p>
<p id='13'>फलभक्षेण राजर्षे पश्य कर्मात्रिणा कृतम्। तस्यापि विस्तरेणोक्तं कर्मात्रेः सुमहात्मनः। ब्रवीम्यहं ब्रूहि वा त्वमत्रितः क्षत्रियं वरम्॥<br />I have thus described to you, in full, the feat of the great Atri. Shail I go on? Or, will you say anything? Is there a Kshatriya who is superior to this twiceborn Rishi?</p>
<p id='14'>इत्युक्तस्त्वर्जुनस्तूष्णीमभूद् वायुस्ततोऽब्रवीत्। शृणु राजन् महत्कर्म च्यवनस्य महात्मनः॥<br />Thus addressed, Arjuna remained silent. The god of wind once more spoke to him. Hear, O king, the feat achieved by the great Chyavana.</p>
<p id='15'>अश्विनोः प्रतिसंश्रुत्य च्यवनः पाकशासनम्। प्रोवाच सहितो देवैः सोमपावश्विनौ कुरु॥<br />Having made his promise to the twin Ashvins, Chyavana addressed the chastiser of Paka, saying, Do you make the Ashvins drinkers of Soma with all the other celestials.</p>
<p id='16'>इन्द्र उवाच अस्माभिर्निन्दितावेतौ भवेतां सोमपौ कथम्। देवैर्न सम्मितावेतौ तस्मान्मैवं वदस्व नः॥<br />Indra said The Ashvins have been outcasted by us. How, then, can these be admitted into the sacrificial circle for drinking Soma with the others? They are not classed with the celestials. Do not, therefore, tell us so.</p>
<p id='17'>अश्विभ्यां सह नेच्छामः सोमं पातुं महाव्रत। यदन्यद् वक्ष्यसे विप्र तत् करिष्यामि ते वचः॥<br />O you of great vows, we do not wish to drink Soma in the company of the Ashvins! Whatever other commands you may be pleased to utter, O learned Brahmana, we are ready to do.</p>
<p id='18'>च्यवन उवाच पिबेतामश्विनौ सोमं भवद्भिः सहिताविमौ। उभावेतावपि सुरौ सूर्यपुत्रौ सुरेश्वर॥<br />Chyavana said The twin Ashvins shall drink Soma with all of you. Both of them are gods, O king of the celestials, for they are the sons of the Sun.</p>
<p id='19'>क्रियतां मद्वचो देवा यथा वै समुदाहृतम्। एतद् वः कुर्वतां श्रेयो भवेन्नैतदकुर्वताम्॥<br />Let the gods do what I have said. By acting according to those words, the gods will reap great advantage. By acting otherwise evil will overtake them.</p>
<p id='20'>इन्द्र उवाच अश्विभ्यां सह सोमं वै न पास्यामि द्विजोत्तमा पिबन्त्वन्ये यथाकामं नाहं पातुमिहोत्सहे॥<br />Indra said I shall not, O foremost of twiceborn persons, drink Soma with the Ashvins. Let others drink with them as they please. As for mysclf, I dare not do it.</p>
<p id='21'>च्यवन उवाच न चेत् करिष्यसि वचो मयोक्तं बलसूदन। मया प्रमथितः सद्यः सोमं पास्यसि वै मखे॥<br />Chyavana said If, O destroyer of Vala, you will not obey my words, you shall, this very day, drink Soma with them in sacrifice, compelled by me.</p>
<p id='22'>वायु उवाच ततः कर्म समारब्धं हिताय सहसाश्विनोः। च्यवनेन ततो मन्त्रैरभिभूताः सुराऽभवन्॥<br />The god of wind said Then Chyavana, taking the Ashvins with him, began a great religious rite for their bencfit. The gods all became stupefied by Chyavana with the help of his Mantras.</p>
<p id='23'>तत् तु कर्म समारब्धं दृष्ट्वेन्द्रः क्रोधमूर्च्छितः। उद्यम्य विपुलं शैलं च्यवनं समुपाद्रवत्॥<br />Seeing that feat undertaken by Chyavana, Indra became enraged. Taking up a huge mountain he ran against that Rishi.</p>
<p id='24'>तथा वज्रेण भगवानमर्षाकुललोचनः। तमापतन्तं दृष्ट्वैव च्यवनस्तपसान्वितः॥<br />The king of the deities was also armed with the Thunderbolt. Then the illustrious Chyavana, gifted with penances, cast angry looks upon Indra as he advanced.</p>
<p id='25'>अद्भिः सिक्त्वास्तम्भयत् तं सवज्रं सहपर्वतम्। अथेन्द्रस्य महाघोरं सोऽसृजच्छत्रुमेव हि॥<br />Throwing a little water at him, he paralysed the king of the deities with his Thunderbolt and mountain. As the result of the religious rite he had begun, he created a terrible Asura hostile to Indra.</p>
<p id='26'>मदं नामाहुतिमयं व्यादितास्यं महामुनिः। तस्य दन्तसहस्रं तु बभूव शतयोजनम्॥<br />Made of the libations he had poured on the sacred fire, that Asura was called Mada, of mouth gaping wide. Such was the Asura that the great ascetic created with the help of Mantras. There were a thousand teeth in his mouth, extending for a hundred Yojanas.</p>
<p id='27'>द्वियोजनशतास्तस्य दंष्ट्राः परमदारुणाः। हनुस्तस्याभवद् भूमावास्यं चास्यास्पृशद् दिवम्।।२८<br />Of terrible appearance, his fangs were two hundred Yojanas in length. One of his cheeks rested on the Earth and the other touched the sky.</p>
<p id='28'>जिह्वामूले स्थितास्तस्य सर्वे देवाः सवासवाः। तिमेरास्यमनुप्राप्ता यथा मत्स्या महार्णवे॥<br />Indeed, all the gods with Vasava seemed to stand at the root of that great Asura's tongue, as fishes when they enter into the wide open mouth of a leviathan.</p>
<p id='29'>ते सम्मन्त्र्य ततो देवा मदस्यास्यसमीपगाः। अब्रुवन् सहिताः शक्रं प्रणमास्मै द्विजातये॥<br />While standing within the mouth of Mada, the gods consulted speedily and then addressing Indra, said, Do you soon bend your head in respect to this twiceborn personage.</p>
<p id='30'>अश्विभ्यां सह सोमं च पिबाम विगतज्वराः। ततः स प्रणतः शक्रश्चकार च्यवनस्य तत्॥<br />We shall without any hesitation drink Soma with the Ashvins in our company. Then bowing down his head to Chyavana, Shakra obeyed his command.</p>
<p id='31'>च्यवन् कृतवानेतावश्विनौ सोमपायिनौ। ततः प्रत्याहरत् कर्म मदं च व्यभजन्मुनिः॥<br />Thus did Chyavana make the Ashvins drinkers of Soma with the other gods. Calling back Mada, the Rishi then assigned him his work.</p>
<p id='32'>अक्षेषु मृगयायां च पाने स्त्रीषु च वीर्यवान्॥ एतैर्दोषैर्नरा राजन् क्षयं यान्ति न संशयः।<br />Soma was ordered to live in dice, in hunting, in drinking, and in women. Hence, O king, those men who betake themselves to these, forsooth, incet with destruction.</p>
<p id='33'>तस्मादेतान् नरो नित्यं दूरतः परिवर्जयेत्॥ एतत् ते च्यवनस्यापि कर्म राजन् प्रकीर्तितम्। ब्रवीम्यहं ब्रूहि वा त्वं क्षत्रियं ब्राह्मणाद् वरम्॥<br />Hence, one should always renounce these faults to a great distance. Thus, O king, I have described to you thc fcat achieved by Chyavana. Shall I go on? Or, will you say anything in reply? Is there a Kshatriya who is higher than the Brahmana Chyavana?</p>
