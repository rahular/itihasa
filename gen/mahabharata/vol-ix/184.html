<h3>ANUGITA PARVA: Chapter 16</h3><h4>The story of Anugita</h4><p id='1'>जनमेजय उवाच सभायां वसतोस्तत्र निहत्यारीन् महात्मनोः। केशवार्जुनयोः का नु कथा समभवद् द्विज॥<br />Janamejaya said When the great Keshava and Arjuna after killing their enemies went to the assembly rooms what conversation, O twice-born one, took place between them?</p>
<p id='2'>कृष्णेन सहितः पार्थ:स्वं राज्यं प्राप्य केवलम्। तस्यां सभायां दिव्यायां विजहार मुदा युतः॥<br />The son of Pritha (Arjuna), having recovered his own kingdom, spent his time gladly, without doing anything clse, in the company of Krishna, his heart filled with joy, in that palace of celestial beauty.</p>
<p id='3'>तत्र कंचित् सभोद्देशं स्वर्णोद्देशसमं नृप। यदृच्छया तौ मुदितौ जग्मतुः स्वजनावृतौ॥<br />One day, those two listlessly went to a particular part of the palace that looked, O king, like a veritable portion of the celestial region. Themselves filled with joy, they were then surrounded by their relatives and attendants.</p>
<p id='4'>ततः प्रतीतः कृष्णेन सहितः पाण्डवोऽर्जुनः। निरीक्ष्य तां सभां रम्यामिदं वचनमब्रवीत्॥ विदितं मे महाबाहो संग्रामे समुपस्थिते। माहात्म्यं देवकीमातस्तच ते रूपमैश्वरम्॥<br />Pandu's son Arjuna, filled with joy in the company of Krishna, saw that delightful palace, and then addressed his companion, saying, 'O mighty-armed one, your greatness became known to me upon the approach of the battle. O son of Devaki, your form also, as the Lord of the universe, then became known to me.</p>
<p id='5'>यत् तद् भगवता प्रोक्तं पुरा केशव सौहृदात्। तत् सर्वं पुरुषव्याघ्र नष्टं मे भ्रष्टचेतसः॥<br />What your holy self said to me at that time, O Keshava, through love, has all been forgotten by me, O chief of men, on account of the fickleness of my mind.</p>

I conferred on you eternal truths. Indeed, I described to you Religion in its true form and on all the eternal regions.</p>

Crowned with ascetic success and gifted with perfect tranquillity of soul, he had all his senses under complete control. He seemed to shine with the resplendence of Brahma and capable of going everywhere at will. He knew the science of disappearing at will from before the eyes of all.
