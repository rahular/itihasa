<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 53</h3><h4>The history of Jamadagni</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच तस्मिन्नन्तर्हिते विप्रे राजा किमकरोत् तदा। भार्या चास्य महाभागा तन्मे ब्रूहि पितामह॥<br />Yudhishthira said After the Rishi had disappeared, what did the king do and what also his highly-blessed wife? Tell me this O grandfather.</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच अदृष्ट्वा स महीपालस्तमृषि सह भार्यया। परिश्रान्तो निववृते वीडितो नष्टचेतनः॥<br />Bhishma said Not seeing the Rishi, the king, Stricken with shame, toilworn, and losing his senses, returned to his palace, accompanied by his queen.</p>
<p id='3'>स प्रविश्य पुरी दीनो नाभ्यभाषत किंचन। तदेव चिन्तयामास च्यवनस्य विचेष्टितम्॥<br />Entering his mansion in a dejected spirit, The spoke not a word with any one. He thought only of that conduct of Chyavana.</p>
<p id='4'>अथ शून्येन मनसा प्रविश्य स्वगृहं नृपः। ददर्श शयने तस्मिन् शयानं भृगुनन्दनम्।॥<br />With a despairing heart he then went to his room. There he beheld the son of Bhrigu stretched as before on his bed.</p>
<p id='5'>विस्मितौ तमृषि दृष्ट्वा तदाश्चर्ये विचिन्त्य च। दर्शनात् तस्य तु तदा विश्रान्तौ सम्बभूवतुः॥<br />Seeing the Rishi there, they wondered much. Indeed, they began to think upon that very strange incident. The sight of the Rishi removed their fatigue.</p>
<p id='6'>यथास्थानं च तौ स्थित्वा भूयस्तं संववाहतुः। अथापरेण पार्बेन सुष्वाप स महामुनिः॥<br />Seated once more by his side, they again began to gently press his feet as before. Meanwhile the great ascetic continued to sleep soundly as before. Only, he now lay on another side.</p>
<p id='7'>तेनैव च स कालेन प्रत्यबुद्ध्यत वीर्यवान्। न च तौ चक्रतुः किंचिद् विकारं भयशङ्कितौ॥<br />Gifted with great energy, he thus passed another twentyone days. Moved by fear, the royal pair showed no change in their attitude or sentiment towards the Rishi.</p>
<p id='8'>प्रतिबुद्धस्तु स मुनिस्तौ प्रोवाच विशाम्पते। तैलाभ्यङ्गो दीयतां मे स्त्रास्येऽहमिति भारत॥<br />Awaking then from his sleep the ascetic addressed the king and the queen, saying-do you rub my body with oil, I wish to have a bath.</p>
<p id='9'>तौ तथेति प्रतिश्रुत्य श्रुधितौ श्रमकर्शितौ। शतपाकेन तैलेन महार्हेणोपतस्थतुः॥<br />Famishing and toilworn though they were, forthwith they volunteered their services and soon approached the Rishi with a rich oil that had been prepared by boiling it a hundred times.</p>
<p id='10'>ततः सुखासीनमृर्षि वाग्यतौ संववाहतुः। न च पर्याप्तमित्याह भार्गवः सुमहातपाः॥<br />While the Rishi was seated at his ease, the king and the queen, silently, continued to rub him. Gifted with great ascetic merit, the son of Bhrigu did not once utter the word Sufficient.</p>
<p id='11'>यदा तौ निर्विकारौ तु लक्ष्यामास भार्गवः। तत उत्थाय सहसा स्नानशालां विवेश ह॥<br />Bhrigu's son however saw that the royal pair were totally unmoved. Rising up all on a sudden, he entered the bath room.</p>
<p id='12'>क्लृप्तमेव तु तत्रासीत् स्नानीयं पार्थिवोचितम्। असत्कृत्य च तत् सर्वं तत्रैवान्तरधीयत॥ स मुनिः पुनरेवाथ नृपतेः पश्यतस्तदा। नासूयां चक्रतुस्तौ च दम्पती भरतर्षभ॥<br />The various articles necessary for a bath and such as were fit for a king's use, were ready there. Without using, any of those articles, the Rishi once more disappeared there and then by his Yogapower, before king Kushika (and his wife). This, however, O chief of Bharatas, failed to disturb the equanimity of the royal pair.</p>
<p id='13'>अथ स्नातः स भगवान् सिंहासनगतः प्रभुः। दर्शयामास कुशिकं सभार्यं कुरुनन्दन॥<br />The next time the powerful Rishi was seen seated, after a bath, on the throne. It was from that place that he then showed himself to the king and the queen, O delighter of the Kurus.</p>
<p id='14'>संहृष्टवदनो राजा सभार्यः कुशिको मुनिम्। सिद्धमन्नमिति प्रबो निर्विकारो न्यवेदयत्॥<br />With a cheerful face, king Kushika, together with his wife, then offered the Rishi cooked food with great respect. Gifted with wisdom, and with heart totally unmoved, Kushika made this offer.</p>
<p id='15'>तपस्वी उवाच आनीयतामिति मुनिस्तं चोवाच नराधिपम्। स राजा समुपाजह्वे तदन्नं सह भार्यया।॥<br />The Ascetic said Let the food be brought. Assisted by his wife, the king soon brought there the food.</p>
<p id='16'>मासंप्रकारान् विविधाशाकानि विविधानि च। वेसवारविकारांश्च पानकानि लघूनि च॥<br />There were various kinds of meat and different preparations also thereof. There was a great variety of vegetables also and potherbs.</p>
<p id='17'>रसालापूपकांश्चित्रान् मोदकानथ खाण्डवान्। रसान् नानाप्रकारांश्च वन्यं च मुनिभोजनम्॥<br />There were juicy cakes too among those dishes and several agreeable kinds of confectionery, and solid preparations of milk. Indeed, the viands were different in kinds and taste. Among them there were also some foodforest produces-such as ascetics liked and took.</p>
<p id='18'>फलानि च विचित्राणि राजभोज्यानि भूरिशः। बदरेङ्गुदकाश्मर्यभल्लातकफलानि च॥<br />Various sweet fruits fit to be eaten by kings, were also there. There were Vadaras and Ingudas and Kahsmaryyas and Bhallatakas.</p>
<p id='19'>गृहस्थानां च यद् भोज्यं यच्चापि वनवासिनाम्। सर्वमाहारयामास राजा शापभयात् ततः॥<br />The food that was offered contained such things as are taken by householders, as also such things as arc taken by the forest dwellers. Through fear of the Rishi's curse, the king had caused all kinds of food to be gathered and got ready for his guest.</p>
<p id='20'>अथ सर्वमुपन्यस्तमग्रतश्च्यवनस्य तत्। ततः सर्वं समानीय तच्च शय्यासनं मुनिः॥ वस्त्रैः शुभैरवच्छाद्य भोजनोपस्करैः सह। सर्वमादीपयामास च्यवनो भृगुनन्दनः॥<br />All this food, brought from the kitchen, was placed before Chyavana. A seat was also placed for him and a bed too was spread. The dishes were then caused to be covered with white cloths. Soon, however, Chyavana of Bhrigu's race put fire to all the things and reduced them to ashes.</p>
<p id='21'>न च तौ चक्रतुः क्रोधं दम्पती सुमहामती। तयोः सम्प्रेक्षतोरेव पुनरन्तर्हितोऽभवत्॥<br />Gifted with great intelligence, the royal pair showed no anger at this conduct of the Rishi, who once more, after this, disappeared before the very eyes of the king and the queen.</p>
<p id='22'>तथैव च स राजर्षिस्तथौ तां रजनीं तदा। सभार्यो वाग्यत: श्रीमान् न च कोपं समाविशत्।।२४<br />The royal sage Kushika thereupon stood there in the same posture for the whole night, with his wife by his side, and without speaking a word. Gifted with great prosperity, he did not yield to wrath.</p>
<p id='23'>नित्यसंस्कृतमन्नं तु विविधं राजवेश्मनि। शयनानि च मुख्यानि परिषेकाश्च पुष्कला:॥ वस्त्रं च विविधाकारमभवत् समुपार्जितम्। न शशाक ततो द्रष्टुमन्तरं च्यवनस्तदा॥<br />Every day, good and pure food of various sorts, excellent beds, profuse articles needed for bath, and cloths of various sorts, were collected and kept ready in the palace for the Rishi. Indeed, Chyavana could not find any fault in the conduct of the king.</p>
<p id='24'>पुनरेव च विप्रर्षिः प्रोवाच कुशिकं नृपम्। सभार्यो मां रथेनाशु वह यत्र ब्रवीम्यहम्॥<br />Then addressing king Kushika, the twice born Rishi said to him, “Do you with your spouse, yoke yourself to a car and take me on it wherever I shall direct."</p>
<p id='25'>तथेति च प्राह नृपो निर्विशङ्कस्तपोधनम्। क्रीडारथोऽस्तु भगवन्नुत सांग्रामिको रथः॥<br />Unhesitatingly, the king answered Chyavana having asceticism for wealth, saying-So be it! And he further enquired of the Rishi, asking-Which car shall I bring? Shall it be my pleasure car for making pleasure journeys or, shall it be my war-chariot?</p>
<p id='26'>इत्युक्तः स मुनी राज्ञा तेन हृष्टेन तद्वचः। च्यवनः प्रत्युवाचेदं हृष्टः परपुरंजयम्॥ सज्जीकुरु रथं क्षिप्रं यस्ते सांग्रामिको मतः। सायुधः सपताकश्च शक्तीकनकयष्टिमान्॥ किङ्किणीस्वननिर्घोषो युक्तस्तोरणकल्पनैः। जाम्बूनदनिबद्धश्च परमेषुशतान्वितः॥<br />Thus addressed by the delighted and contented King, the ascetic said to him-Do you promptly get ready that chariot with which you attack hostile cities! cities! Indeed, that warchariot of yours, with every weapon, with its standard and flags, its darts and javelins and golden columns and poles, should be made ready. Its rattle resembles the tinkling of bells. It is adorned with numberless arches made of pure gold. It is always furnished with hundreds of high and excellent weapons!</p>
<p id='27'>ततः स तं तथेत्युक्त्वा कल्पयित्वा महारथम्। भार्यां वामे धुरि तदा चात्मानं दक्षिणे तथा॥ त्रिदण्डं वज्रसूच्यग्रं प्रतोदं तत्र चादधत्।<br />The king said So be it, and soon made his great warchariot ready. And he yoked his wife thereto on the left and his own self on the right, And the king placed on the chariot, among its other articles, the goad which had three handles and which had a point hard as adamant and sharp as the needle.</p>
<p id='28'>सर्वमेतत् तथा दत्त्वा नृपो वाक्यमथाब्रवीत्॥ भगवन् क्व रथो यातु ब्रवीतु भृगुनन्दन।<br />Having placed every article upon the car, the king said to the Rishi-O holy one, where shall the chariot proceed? O let the son of Bhrigu issue his order.</p>
<p id='29'>यत्र वक्ष्यसि विप्रर्षे तत्र यास्यति ते रथः।३४॥ एवमुक्तस्तु भगवान् प्रत्युवाचाथ तं नृपम्। इत: प्रभृति यातव्यं पदकं पदकं शनैः॥ श्रमो मम यथा न स्यात् तथा मच्छन्दचारिणौ।<br />This your chariot shall proceed to the place which you may be pleased to direct! Thus addressed, the holy' man replied to the king, saying-Let the car go hence, dragged slowly, step by step. Obeying my will, do you two proceed in such a way that I may not feel any exhaustion.</p>
<p id='30'>सुसुखं चैव वोढव्यो जनः सर्वश्च पश्यतु॥ नोत्सार्याः पथिकाः केचित् तेभ्यो दास्ये वसु ह्यहम्।<br />I should be borne away pleasantly, and let all your people see this march that I make through their midst. No person that comes to me, as I proceed along the road, should be driven away. I shall distribute riches among all.</p>
<p id='31'>ब्राह्मणेभ्यश्च ये कामानर्थयिष्यन्ति मां पथि॥ सर्वान् दास्याम्यशेषेण धनं रत्नानि चैव हि।<br />To the Brahmanas who may approach me on the way, I shall grant their wishes and bestow upon all of the them gems and riches without stint.</p>
<p id='32'>क्रियतां निखिलेनैतन्मा विचारय पार्थिव॥ तस्य तद् वचनं श्रुत्वा राजा भृत्यांस्तथाब्रवीत्। यद् यद् ब्रूयान्मुनिस्तत्तत् सर्वं देयमशङ्कितैः॥ ततो रत्नान्यनेकानि स्त्रियो युग्यमजाविकम्। कृताकृतं च कनकं गजेन्द्राचाचलोपमाः॥ अन्वगच्छत तमृषि राजामात्याश्च सर्वशः।<br />Let all this be done, O king, and do not entertain any scruples!-Hearing these words of the Rishi, the king called his servants and told them-Ye should without any fear, give away whatever the ascetic will command. Then profuse jewels and gems and beautiful women, and pairs of sheep, and coined and uncoined gold, and huge elephants resembling, hills or mountain summits, and all the ministers of the king, began to follow the Rishi as he was carried on that chariot.</p>
<p id='33'>हाहाभूतं च तत् सर्वमासीन्नगरमार्तवत्॥ तौ तीक्ष्णाग्रेण सहसा प्रतोदेन प्रतोदितौ। पृष्ठे विद्धौ कटे चैव निर्विकारो तमूहतुः॥<br />Cries of Oh and Alas arose from every part of the city which was plunged in grief at that extraordinary spectacle. The Rishi struck the king and the queen suddenly with that goad having a sharp point. Though thus struck on the back and the cheeks, the royal pair still showed no sign of agitation. On the other hand they continued to carry the Rishi on as before.</p>
<p id='34'>वेपमानौ निराहारौ पञ्चशदात्रकर्षितौ। कथंचिदूहतुर्वीरौ दम्पती तं रथोत्तमम्॥<br />Trembling from head to foot, for no food had passed their lips for fifty nights, and exceedingly weak, the heroic pair somehow succeeded in dragging that excellent chariot.</p>
<p id='35'>बहुशो भृशविद्धौ तौ स्रवन्तो च क्षतोद्भवम्। ददृशाते महाराज पुष्पिताविव किंशुकौ॥<br />Repeatedly and deeply cut by the goad, the royal pair became covered with blood. Indeed, O king, they then looked like a couple of Kinshuka trees in the flowering season.</p>
<p id='36'>तौ दृष्ट्वा पौरवर्गस्तु भृशं शोकसमाकुलः। अभिशापभयत्रस्तो न च किंचिदुवाच ह॥<br />Seeing the plight to which their king and queen had been reduced, the citizens became afflicted with great grief. Filled with fear of the curse of the Rishi, they kept silent under their misery.</p>
<p id='37'>द्वन्द्वशश्चाब्रुवन् सर्वे पश्यध्वं तपसो बलम्। क्रुद्धा अपि मुनिश्रेष्ठं वीक्षितुं नेह शक्नुमः॥<br />Collected in masses they said to each other-See the might of penances! Although all of us are angry, we are still unable to look at the Rishi.</p>
<p id='38'>अहो भगवतो वीर्यं महर्षेर्भावितात्मनः। राज्ञश्चापि सभार्यस्य धैर्यं पश्यत यादृशम्॥<br />Great is the energy of the holy Rishi of purified soul! See also the endurance of the king and his royal spouse.</p>
<p id='39'>श्रान्तावपि हि कृच्छ्रेण रथमेनं समूहतुः। न चैतयोर्विकारं वै ददर्श भृगुनन्दनः॥<br />Though exhausted with fatigue and hunger, they are still carrying the car! The son of Bhrigu, despite the misery he caused to Kushika and his queen, could see no sign of dissatisfaction or agitation in them.</p>
<p id='40'>ततः स निर्विकारौ तु दृष्ट्वा भृगुकुलोद्वहः। वसु विश्राणयामास यथा वैश्रवणस्तथा॥<br />Bhishma said The perpetuator of Bhrigu's race, seeing the king and the queen totally unmoved, began to distribute wealth very largely as if he were a second Lord of Treasures.</p>
<p id='41'>तत्रापि राजा प्रीतात्मा यथादिष्टमथाकरोत्। ततोऽस्य भगवान् प्रीतो बभूव मुनिसत्तमः॥<br />At this deed also, king Kushika showed no mark of dissatisfaction. He did as the Rishi ordered. Seeing all this, that illustrious and best of ascetics became pleased.</p>
<p id='42'>अवतीर्य रथश्रेष्ठाद् दम्पती तौ मुमोच ह। विमोच्य चैतौ विधिवत् ततो वाक्यमुवाच ह॥<br />Descending from that excellent car, he unharnessed the royal pair. Having freed them, he addressed them duty.</p>
<p id='43'>स्निग्धगम्भीरया वाचा भार्गवः सुप्रसन्नया। ददानि वां वरं श्रेष्ठं तं ब्रूतामिति भारत॥<br />Indeed the son of Bhrigu, in a soft, deep, and delighted voice, saidI am ready to give an excellent boon to you both.</p>
<p id='44'>सुकुमारौ च तौ विद्धौ कराभ्यां मुनिसत्तमः। पस्पर्शामृतकल्पाभ्यां स्नेहाद् भरतसत्तम॥<br />Delicate as they were, their bodies had been pierced with the goad. Moved by affection, that best of ascetics softly touched them with his hands, whose healing virtues resembled those of ambrosia itself, O chief of the Bharatas.</p>
<p id='45'>अथाब्रवीन्नृपो वाक्यं श्रमो नास्त्यावयोरिह। विश्रान्तौ च प्रभावात् ते उचतुस्तौ तु भार्गवम्॥<br />Then the king answered Myself and my wife have felt no exhaustion Indeed, all their fatigue had been removed through the power of the Rishi, and hence it was that the king could say so to the Rishi.</p>
<p id='46'>अथ तौ भगवान् प्राह प्रहृष्टश्च्यवनस्तदा। न वृथा व्याहृतं पूर्वं यन्मया तद् भविष्यति॥<br />Pleased with their conduct, the illustrious Chyavana said to them I have never before spoken falsehood; It must, therefore be as I have said.</p>
<p id='47'>रमणीयः समुद्देशो गङ्गातीरमिदं शुभम्। किंचित्कालं व्रतपरो निवत्स्यामीह पार्थिव॥<br />This spot on the banks of Ganga is very charming and auspicious. I shall, observing a vow, live for a little while here, O king.</p>
