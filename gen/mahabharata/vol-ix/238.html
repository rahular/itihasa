<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>तस्य कृष्णो ददौ हृष्टो बहुरत्नं विशेषतः। तथान्ये वृष्णिशार्दूला नाम चास्याकरोत् प्रभुः॥ पितुस्तव महाराज सत्यसंधो जनार्दनः। परिक्षीणे कुले यस्माज्जातोऽयमभिमन्युजः॥ परिक्षिदिति नामास्य भवत्वित्यब्रवीत् तदा। सोऽवर्धते यथाकालं पिता तव जनाधिप॥ मनःप्रह्लादनश्चासीत् सर्वलोकस्य भारत। मासजातस्तु ते वीर पिता भवति भारत॥ अथाजग्मुः सुबहुलं रत्नमादाय पाण्डवाः। तान् समीपगताञ्श्रुत्वा निर्ययुर्वृष्णिपुङ्गवाः॥<br />Rejoicing greatly, Krishna made gifts to the child of many valuable gems. The other chiefs of the Vrishni-race, did the same. Then the powerful Janardana, firmly following truth, bestowed a name on the infant who was your father, O monarch. Since this child of Abhimanyu has been born at a time when this family has become nearly extinct, let his name be Parikshit.' This is what he said. Then your father, O king, began to grow, and please all the people, O Bharata. When your father was month old, O hero, the Pandavas returned to heir capital, bringing with them abundant riches. Hearing that the Pandavas were near, those foremost ones of the Vrishni-race went out.</p>

<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>वेश्मानि समलंचक्रुः पौराश्चापि जनेश्वर। देवतायतनानां च पूजाः सुविविधास्तथा॥ संदिदेशाथ विदुरः पाण्डुपुत्रप्रियेप्सया। राजमार्गाश्च तत्रासन् सुमनोभिरलंकृताः॥<br />The citizens also, O king, adorned their respective palaces. Desirous of doing what was beneficial to the sons of Pandu, Vidura ordered various kinds of adoration to be offered to the celestials established in their respective temples. The principal streets of the city were adorned with flowers.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>शुशुभे तत्पुरं चापि समुद्रौघनिभस्वनम्। नर्तकैश्चापि नृत्यद्भिर्गायकानां च निःस्वनैः॥ आसीद् वैश्रवणस्येव निवासस्तत्पुरं तदा। बन्दिभिश्च नरै राजन् स्त्रीसहायैश्च सर्वशः॥ तत्र तत्र विविक्तेषु समन्तादुपशोभितम्। पताका धूयमानाश्च समन्तापन्मातस्श्विना॥ अदर्शयन्निव तदा कुरून् वै दक्षिणोत्तरान्। अघोषयंस्तदा चापि पुरुषा राजधूर्गताः। सर्वराष्ट्रविहारोऽद्य रत्नाभरणलक्षणः॥<br />Indeed, the city was filled with the noise of thousands of voices which resembled the softened roar of distant ocean waves. With dancers all engaged in their business, and with the voice of singers, the (Kuru) city then resembled the palace of Vaishravana himself. Bards and culogists, O king, accompanied by beautiful women, were seen to adorn various retired spots in the city. The pennons were made by the wind to float gaily on every part of the city, as if bent upon showing the Kurus the southern and the northern points of the compass. All the officers also of the government loudly proclaimed that that was to be a day of rejoicing for the whole kingdom as a mark of the success of the enterprise for bringing a profusion of gems and other valuables.</p>
