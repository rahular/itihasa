O you of mighty arms, I am never satiated with your words.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>भीष्म उवाच अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। ऋषेरुद्दालकेर्वाक्यं नाचिकेतस्य चोभयोः॥<br />Bhishma said Regarding it is cited the old discourse between the Rishi Uddalaki and Nachiketa.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>ऋषिरुद्दालकिर्दीक्षामुपगम्य ततः सुतम्। त्वं मामुपचरस्वेति नाचिकेतमभाषत॥<br />Once on a time the Rishi Uddalaki, gifted with great intelligence, approaching his son Nachiketa, said to him, Do you wait upon and serve me.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>समाप्ते नियमे तस्मिन् महर्षिः पुत्रमब्रवीत्। उपस्पर्शनसक्तस्य स्वाध्यायाभिरतस्य च॥ इध्मा दर्भाः सुमनसः कलशश्चातिभोजनम्। विस्मृतं मे तदादाय नदीतीरादिहाव्रज॥<br />Upon the completion of the vow he had observed, the great Rishi once more said to his son, Engaged in performing my ablutions and deeply busy with my Vedic study, I have forgotten to bring with me the firewood, the Kusha blades, the flowers, the waterjar, and the potherbs I had collected. Bring me those things from the riverbank.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>गत्वानवाप्य तत् सर्वं नदीवेगसमाप्लुतम्। न पश्यामि तदित्येवं पितरं सोऽब्रवीन्मुनिः॥<br />The son went there, but found all the articles washed away by the current. Returning to his father, he said “I do not see the things."</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>क्षुत्पिपासाश्रमाविष्टो मुनिरुद्दालकिस्तदा। यमं पश्येति तं पुत्रमशपत् स महातपाः॥<br />Stricken as he then was by hunger, thirst, and fatigue, the Rishi Uddalaki of great ascetic merit, in a sudden anger cursed his son, saying, meet with Yama today.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>तथा स पित्राभिहतो वाग्वज्रेण कृताञ्जलिः। प्रसीदेति ब्रुवन्नेव गतसत्त्वोऽपतद् भुवि॥<br />Thus struck by his father with the thunder of his speech, the son, with joined hands, said, “Be pleased with me. Soon, however, he dropped down on the earth dead.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>नाचिकेतं पिता दृष्ट्वा पतितं दुःखमूच्छितः। किं मया कृतमित्युक्त्वा निपपात महीतले॥<br />Seeing Nachiketa prostrated upon the earth, his father become senseless with grief. He, too, exclaiming, Alas, what have I done! dropped down on the earth.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>तस्य दुःखपरीतस्य स्वं पुत्रमनुशोचतः। व्यतीतं तदहःशेषं सा चोग्रा तत्र शर्वरी॥<br />Filled with grief as he bewailed for his son, the rest of that day passed away and night came.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>पित्र्येणाश्रुप्रपातेन नाचिकेतः कुरूद्वह। प्रास्पन्दच्छयने कौश्ये वृष्ट्या सस्यमिवाप्लुतम्॥<br />Then Nachiketa, O son of Kuru's race, drenched by the tears of his father, showed signs of returning life as he lay on a mat of Kusha grass. His regaining of life under the tears of his father resembled the sprouting forth of seeds when drenched with good showers.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>स पर्यपृच्छत् तं पुत्रं क्षीणं पर्यागतं पुनः। दिव्यैर्गन्धैः समादिग्धं क्षीणस्वप्नमिवोत्थितम्॥<br />The son, just restored to life, was still weak. His body was smeared with scents and the looked like one just awaking from a deep sleep. The Rishi asked hiin, saying.</p>

<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>प्रत्यक्षदर्शी सर्वस्य पित्रा पृष्टो महात्मना। स तां वार्ता पितुर्मध्ये महर्षीणां न्यवेदयत्॥<br />Thus asked by his great father. Nachiketa who had seen every thing with his own eyes, answered thus in the midst of the Rishis.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>कुर्वन् भवच्छासनमाशु यातो ह्यहं विशालां रुचिरप्रभावाम्। वैवस्वतीं प्राप्य सभामपश्यं सहस्रशो योजनहेमभासम्॥<br />In obedience to your command I proceeded to the vast region of Yama which is possessed of a charming effulgence. There I saw a palatial mansion which extended for thousands of Yojanas and emitted a golden splendour on every part.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>दृष्ट्वैव मामभिमुखमापतन्तं देहीति स शासनमादिदेश। वैवस्वतोऽादिभिरहणैश्च भवत्कृते पूजयामास मां सः॥<br />As soon as Yama saw me approaching with face towards him, he ordered his attendants, saying, Give him a good seat. Indeed the king of the dead, for your sake, adored me with the Arghya and other ingredients.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>ततस्त्वहं तं शनकैरवोचं वृतः सदस्यैरभिपूज्यमानः। प्राप्तोऽस्मि ते विषयं धर्मराज लोकानों यानहं तान् विधत्सव॥<br />Thus adored by Yama and seated in the midst of his counsellors, I then asked him mildly, I have come to your house, O judge of the dead.

Gifted with penances, your father said to you meet with Yama. The energy of your father is like that of a burning fire. I could not possibly falsify that speech of his.</p>

If I am worthy of your attentions, I wish, O king of the dead, to see those regions of great prosperity and happiness that have been reserved for doers of virtuous deeds.</p>

Taking me on that car, he showed me, O foremost of twice born ones, all those charming regions that are reserved for the pious.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>अपश्यं तत्र वेश्मानि तैजसानि महात्मनाम्। नानासंस्थानरूपाणि सर्वरत्नमयानि च॥<br />I saw in those regions many effulgent palaces intended for great persons. Those mansions are of various forns and are adorned with every kind of gems.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>चन्द्रमण्डलशुभ्राणि किङ्किणीजालवन्ति च। अनेकशतभौमानि सान्त लवनानि च।॥<br />Bright as the lunar disc, they are ornamented with rows of tinkling bells, Hundreds among them are many storied. Within them are charming groves and gardens and transparent pools of water.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>वैदूर्यार्कप्रकाशनि रूप्यरुक्ममयानि च। तरुणादित्यवर्णानि स्थावराणि चराणि च॥<br />Effulgent like lapis lazuli and the Sun, and made of silver and gold, their colour resembles that of the morning Sun. Some of them are fixed and soine movable.</p>

<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>नद्यो वीथ्यः सभा वाप्यो दीर्घिकाश्चैव सर्वशः। घोषवन्ति च यानानि युक्तान्यथ सहस्रशः॥<br />There are also many rivers and roads and spacious halls and lakes and large tanks. Thousands of cars with rattling wheels may be seen there, having excellent horses yoked to them.</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>क्षीरस्रवा वै सरितो गिरीश्च सर्पिस्तथा विमलं चापि तोयम्। नदृष्टपूर्वान् सुबहूनपश्यम्॥<br />Many rivers of milk, many hills of clarified butter and large pieces of transparent water are there. Indeed, I saw many such regions never seen by me before, of happiness and joy, approved by the king of dead.</p>
<p id='27'><a href='#27'></a>मवोचं वै प्रभविष्णुं पुराणम्। क्षीरस्यैताः सर्पिषश्चैव नद्यः शश्वत्स्रोताः कस्य भोज्याः प्रदिष्टा॥<br />Seeing all those objects, I addressed the ancient and powerful judge of the dead, saying For whose use and enjoyment have these rivers with eternal currents of milk and clarified butter been ordained?</p>
<p id='28'><a href='#28'></a>यम उवाच यमोऽब्रवीद् विद्धि भोज्यास्त्वमेता ये दातारः साधवो गोरसानाम्। अन्ये लोकाः शाश्वता वीतशोकैः समाकीर्णा गोप्रदाने रतानाम्॥<br />Yama said These rivers of milk and clarified butter are for the enjoyment of those pious persons who make gifts in the world of men. Other eternal worlds there are which are filled with such palaces free from every sort of sorrow. These are reserved for th« se persons who make gift of kine.</p>
<p id='29'><a href='#29'></a>न त्वेतासां दानमात्रं प्रशस्तं पात्रं कालो गोविशेषे विधिश्च। ज्ञात्वां देयं विप्र गवान्तरं हि दुःखं ज्ञातुं पावकादित्यभूतम्॥<br />The mere gift of kine is not laudable. There are considerations of fitness or otherwise about the person to whom kine should be given, the time for making those gifts, the kind of kine and rites that should be observed in making the gifts. Gifts of kine should be made after knowing the qualifications of both Brahmanas and the kine themselves. Kine should not be given to one in whose house they are likely to suffer from fire or the sun.</p>
<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>स्वाध्यायवान् योऽतिमात्रं तपस्वी वैतानस्थो ब्राह्मणः पात्रमासाम्। कृच्छ्रोत्सृष्टाः योषणाभ्यागताश्च द्वारैरेतैर्गोविशेषाः प्रशस्ताः॥<br />That Brahmana, who is endued with Vedic learning, who is of austere penances, and who celebrates sacrifices, is considered as worthy of receiving kine in gift. Those kine which have been saved from distressful situations, or which have been given by poor householders from want of sufficient means to feed and cherish them, are for these reasons, counted as of great value.</p>
<p id='31'><a href='#31'></a>तिस्रो राज्यस्त्वद्भिपोष्य भूमौ तृप्ता गावस्तर्पितेभ्यः प्रदेयाः। स्त्र्यहं दत्त्वा गोरसैर्वर्तितव्यम्॥<br />Abstaining from all food and subsisting upon water alone for three nights and sleeping the while on the naked earth, one should, having properly fed the kine intended to be given away, give them to Brahmanas after having pleased them also (with other gifts).</p>
<p id='32'><a href='#32'></a>दत्त्वा धेनुं सुव्रता कांस्यदोहां कल्याणवत्सामलायिनी च। स्तावद् वर्षाण्यश्नुते स्वर्गलोकम्॥<br />The kine, given away, should be accompanied by their calves. They should, again, be such as to bring forth good calves at the proper They should be accompanied with other articles. Having completed the gift, the giver should live for three days on only milk and abstaining from food of every other kind.</p>

He who gives a bull to a Brahmana, that is wellbroken and capable of carrying loads, strong and young in years, disinclined to do any mischief, largesized and powerful enjoys those regions, approved of the righteous, that are reserved for givers of kine.</p>
<p id='34'><a href='#34'></a>गोषु क्षान्तं गोशरण्यं कृतज्ञं वृत्तिग्लानं तादृशं पात्रमाहुः। वृद्धे ग्लाने सम्भ्रमे वा महार्थे कृष्यर्थं वा होम्यहेतोः प्रसूत्याम्॥ गुर्वर्थं वा बालपुष्ट्याभिषणां गां वै दातुं देशकालोऽविशिष्टः। अन्तर्ज्ञाताः सक्रयज्ञानलब्धाः प्राणक्रीता निर्जिता यौतकाच॥<br />He is considered as a proper person for receiving a cow in gift who is known to be mild towards kine, who takes kine for his refuge, who is grateful, and who has no means of livelihood assigned to him. When an old man becomes ill, or when a famine takes place or when a Brahmana intends to celebrate a sacrifice, or when one wishes to till for agriculture, or when one gets a son through the efficacy of a Home performed for the purpose, or for the use of one's preceptor, or for the sustenance of a child, one should give away a loved cow. These are the considerations that are spoken highly of about place and time. The kine worthy of being given away are those that give profuse milk, or those which wellknown, or those that have been acquired as honoraria for learning, or those that have been purchased for price, or those that have been obtained in exchange by offering other living are creatures, or those that have been got by prowess of arms, or those that have been got as marriagedower.</p>

He said, In the absence of kine, a person by making gifts of the substitute of kine, acquires the merit of making gifts of kine.</p>
<p id='37'><a href='#37'></a>अलाभे यो गवां दद्याद् घृतधेनुं यतव्रतः। तस्यैता घृतवाहिन्यः क्षरन्ते वत्सला इव॥<br />If in the absence of kine, one makes a gift of a cow made of clarified butter, observant of a vow the while, one gets for one's use these rivers of clarified butter all of which approach one like an affectionate mother approaching her loved child.</p>
<p id='38'><a href='#38'></a>घृतालाभे तु यो दद्यात् तिलधेनुं यतव्रतः। स दुर्गात् तारितो धेन्वा क्षीरनद्यां प्रमोदते॥<br />If in absence of even a cow made of clarified butter, one makes a gift of a cow made of sesame seeds, observing a vow the while, one succeeds with the help of that cow to get over all calamities in this world and to enjoy great happiness hereafter from these rivers of milk that you see.</p>

I have now got a great sacrifice whose performance does not require much riches. That sacrifice may be said to originate from me, O sire. Others will obtain it also. It is not quite of a piece with the ordinances of the Vedas.</p>
<p id='42'><a href='#42'></a>शापो ह्ययं भवतोऽनुग्रहाय प्राप्तो मया यत्र दृष्ट्वा यमो वै। दानव्युष्टिं तत्र दृष्ट्वा महात्मन् नि:संदिग्धान् दानधर्मोश्चरिष्ये॥<br />The curse that you had imprecated on me was no curse but was in sooth a blessing, since it enabled me to see the great king of the dead. There I have seen what the rewards are of gifts. I shall henceforth, O you of great soul, practise the duty of gift without any doubt about its rewards.</p>
<p id='43'><a href='#43'></a>इदं च मामब्रवीद् धर्मराजः पुनः पुनः सम्प्रहृष्टो महर्षे दानेन यः प्रयतोऽभूत् सदैव विशेषतो गोप्रदानं च कुर्यात्॥<br />And, O great Rishi, the righteous Yama, filled with joy, repeatedly told me. One who, by making repeated gifts, has succeeded in acquiring purity of mind should then make gift of kine in particular.</p>
<p id='44'><a href='#44'></a>शुद्धो ह्यर्थो नावमन्यस्व धर्मान् पात्रे देयं देशकालोपपन्ने। तस्माद् गावस्ते नित्यमेव प्रदेया मा भूच्च ते संशयः कश्चिदत्र॥<br />The subject is fraught with sanctity. Do you never disregard the duties of gifts. Gifts, again, should be made to worth persons, when time and place are suitable. Do you, therefore, always make gifts of kine. Never entertain any doubt about it.</p>

Engaged in performing Shraddhas in honour of the departed manes and in all religious acts of righteousness, they used to make, according to their power, gifts of kine, and as the reward of those acts they have attained to the celestial region and are shining in effulgence for such virtue.</p>

After making the gift, one should then live for ten days together upon only the milk of kine, their dung and their urin ..</p>
<p id='48'><a href='#48'></a>र्वेदावाप्तिर्गोयुगस्य प्रदाने। तीर्थावाप्तिर्गोप्रयुक्तप्रदाने पापोत्सर्गः कपिलायाः प्रदाने॥<br />The merit that one acquires by making a gift of a bull is equal to that of the divine cow. By making a gift of a couple of kine one gains, as the reward thereof, a mastery of the Vedas. By making a gift of cars and vehicles with kine yoked thereto, one wins the merit of baths in sacred water. By making a gift of a cow of the Kapila kine, one becomes purged of all his sins.</p>

There is nothing higher than the milk which is given by kine. The gift of a cow is truly considered as a very superior gift.</p>
<p id='50'><a href='#50'></a>गावो लोकांस्तारयन्ति क्षरन्त्यो गावश्चान्नं संजनयन्ति लोके। यस्तं जानन गवां हार्दमेति स वै गन्ता निरयं पापचेताः॥<br />Kine, by giving milk, rescue all the worlds from calamity. It is kine, again, that produce the food upon which creatures live. One who, knowing the extent of the service that kine do, does not entertain in his heart love for kine, is a sinner who is sure to sink in Hell.</p>

The word that signifies the cow means also the rays of the Sun. The giver of a cow begets a very large progeny inhabiting a large part of the Earth. Hence, he who gives a cow shines like a second Sun in effulgence.</p>

Such a disciple is sure to go to Heaven every time. The selection of a preceptor is considered as a high duty by persons knowing the ordinances. This is, indeed, the initial ordinance. All other ordinances depend upon it.</p>

The deities and men and ourselves also, in wishing good to others, say, Let the merits of gifts be yours on account of your virtue?</p>
<p id='55'><a href='#55'></a>इत्युक्तोऽहं धर्मराजं द्विजर्षे धर्मात्मानं शिरसाभिप्रणम्य। अनुज्ञातस्तेन वैवस्वतेन प्रत्यागमं भगवत्पादमूलम्॥<br />Thus did the judge of the dead speak to me, O twiceborn Rishi. I then bowed my head to the righteous Yama. Getting his permission I left his kingdom and have now come to the sole of your feet.</p>
