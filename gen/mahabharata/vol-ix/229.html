The motive of the great one was that his father might not hear what was highly unpleasant to him.</p>

<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>सुभद्रा तु तमुत्क्रान्तमात्मजस्य वधं रणे। आचक्ष्व कृष्ण सौभद्रवमित्यपतद् भुवि॥<br />(His sister) Subhadra, noticing that the slaughter of her son had not been mentioned, addressed her brother, saying, Do you narrate the death of my son, O Krishna!-and dropped down on the earth (in a swoon).</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>तामपश्यन्निपतितां वसुदेवः क्षितौ तदा। दृष्ट्वैव च पपातोळें सोऽपि दुःखेन मूर्छितः॥<br />Vasudeva saw his daughter fallen on the ground. As soon as he saw this, he also fell down, deprived of his senses by grief.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>ततः स दौहित्रवधदुःखशोकसमाहतः। वसुदेवो महाराज कृष्णं वाक्यमथाब्रवीत्॥ ननु त्वं पुण्डरीकाक्ष सत्यवाग् भुवि विश्रुतः॥ यद् दौहित्रवधं मेऽद्य न ख्यापयसि शत्रुहन्।<br />(Regaining his senses) Vasudeva, afflicted with grief at the death of his daughter's son, O king, addressed Krishna, saying, O lotus-eyed one, you are famed on Earth for being truthful in speech. Why, however, O destroyer of enemies, do you not tell me today of the death of my daughter's son?</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>तद् भागिनेयनिधनं तत्त्वेनाचक्ष्व मे प्रभो॥ सदृशाक्षस्तव कथं शत्रुभिर्निहतो रणे।<br />O powerful one, tell me in full of the destruction of your sister's son! Having eyes resembling thine, alas, how was he killed in battle by enemies.</p>
