At this, the god of wind once more addressed him saying, When the dwellers of Heaven, headed by Indra, found themselves within the mouth of the Asura Mada, at that time, Chyavana took away from them the Earth.</p>

Indeed, those great ones, afflicted with grief, then threw themselves unreservedly upon the Grandfather's protection.</p>

The Brahmanas replied, enquiring, Whom shall we subjugate? Thus asked, the celestials said to them, Do you subjugate the Kapas.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>भूगतान् हि विजेतारो वयमित्यब्रुवन् द्विजाः। ततः कर्म समारब्धं ब्राह्मणैः कपनाशनम्॥ तच्छ्रुत्वा प्रेषितो दूतो ब्राह्मणेभ्यो धनी कपैः।<br />The Brahmanas then said, Bringing them down on the Earth first, we shall quickly subjugate them. After this, the Brahmanas began a rite having for its object the destruction of the Kapas. As soon as this was heard of by the Kapas, they immediately sent a messenger of theirs, named Dhani, to those Brahmanas.</p>
