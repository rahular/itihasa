<h3>ASHRAMAVASAIKA PARVA: Chapter 3</h3><h4>Gruel act of Bhima, the grief of Dhritarashtra and Yudhishthira</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच युधिष्ठिरस्य नृपतेर्दुर्योधनपितुस्तदा। नान्तरं ददृशू राज्ये पुरुषाः प्रणयं प्रति॥<br />The people who lived in the Kuru kingdom could not mark any difference in the cordiality which existed between king Yudhishthira and the father of Duryodhana.</p>
<p id='2'>यदा तु कौरवो राजा पुत्रं सस्मार दुर्मतिम्। तदा भीमं हृदा राजन्नपध्याति स पार्थिवः॥<br />When the Kuru king recollected his wicked son, he then could not but feel unfriendly, in his heart, towards Bhima.</p>
<p id='3'>तथैव भीमसेनोऽपि धृतराष्ट्र जनाधिपम्। नामर्षयत राजेन्द्र सदैव दुष्टवद्धदा॥<br />Bhiimasena also, O king, moved by a wicked heart, was unable to put up with king Dhritarashtra.</p>
<p id='4'>अप्रकाशान्यप्रियाणि चकारास्य वृकोदरः। आज्ञा प्रत्यहरच्चापि कृतज्ञैः पुरुषैः सदा॥<br />Vrikodara secretly did many deeds that were disagreeable to the old king. Through deceitful servants he caused the commands of his uncle to be disobeyed.</p>
<p id='5'>स्मरन् दुर्मन्त्रितं तस्य वृत्तान्यप्यस्य कानिचित्। अथ भीमः सुहृन्मध्ये बाहुशब्दं तथाकरोत्॥ संश्रवे धृतराष्ट्रस्य गान्धार्याश्चाप्यमर्षणः। स्मृत्वा दुर्योधनं शत्रु कर्णदुःशासनावपि॥ प्रोवाचेदं सुरंब्धो भीमः स परुषं वचः।<br />Recollecting the evil advice of the old king and some deeds of his, Bhima, one days, in the midst of his friends, slapped his armpits, in the hearing of Dhritarashtra and of Gandhari. The angry Vrikodara, recollecting his enemies Duyrodhana and Karna and Dushasana, gave way to a fit of passion, and said these harsh words :-'The sons of the blind king, capable of fighting with various kinds of weapons, have all been dispatched by me to the other world with these arms of mine which resemble a pair of iron clubs.</p>
<p id='6'>अन्धस्य नृपतेः पुत्रा मया परिघबाहुना॥ नीता लोकममुं सर्वे नानाशस्त्रास्त्रयोधिनः।<br />Indeed, these are those two arms of mine, loO king like maces of iron, and invincible by cnemies, coming within whose clasp the sons of Dhritarashtra have all been killed.</p>
<p id='7'>इमौ तौ परिघप्रख्यौ भुजौ मम दुरासदौ॥ ययोरन्तरमासाद्य धार्तराष्ट्राः क्षयं गताः।<br />These are those two well-developed and round arms of mine, resembling a pair of elephantine trunks. Coming within their clasp, the foolish sons of Dhritarashtra have all been killed.</p>
<p id='8'>ताविमौ चन्दनेनाक्तौ चन्दना) च मे भुजौ॥ याभ्यां दुर्योधनो नीतः क्षयं ससुतबान्धवः।<br />Smeared with sandal-paste and deserving of that adornment are those two arms of mine by which Duryodhana has been sent to the other world along with all his sons and kinsmen.'</p>
<p id='9'>एताश्चान्याश्च विविधाः शल्यभूता नराधिपः॥ वृकोदरस्य ता वाचः श्रुत्वा निर्वेदमागमत्।<br />Hearing these and many other words, O king, of Vrikodara, which were so many darts, king Dhritarashtra gave way to cheerlessness and sorrow.</p>
<p id='10'>सा च बुद्धिमती देवी कालपर्यायवेदिनी॥ गान्धारी सर्वधर्मज्ञा तान्यलीकानि शुश्रुवे।<br />Queen Gandhari, however, who conversant with every duty and endued with great intelligence, and who knew what Time brings on its course, considered them as untrue.</p>
<p id='11'>ततः पञ्चदशे वर्षे समतीते नराधिपः॥ राजा निर्वेदमापेदे भीमवाग्बाणपीडितः।<br />Then, after fifteen years had passed away, o monarch, king Dhritarashtra, afflicted (constantly) by the wordy arrows of Bhima, became stricken with despair and sorrow.</p>
<p id='12'>नान्वबुध्यत तद् राजा कुन्तीपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरः॥ श्वेताश्वो वाथ कुन्ती वा द्रौपदी वा यशस्विनी। माद्रीपुत्रौ च धर्मज्ञौ चित्तं तस्यान्ववर्तताम्॥<br />King Yudhishthira thc son of Kunti, however, knew it not; nor Arjuna of white horses; nor Kunti; nor Draupadi possessed of great fame; nor the twin sons of Madri, knowing every duty and who were always engaged in acting after the wishes of Dhritarashtra. was to</p>
<p id='13'>राज्ञस्तु चित्तं रक्षन्तौ नोचतुः किञ्चिदप्रियम्। ततः समानयामास धृतराष्ट्रः सुहृज्जनम्॥ वाष्पसंदिग्धमन्यर्थमिदमाह च तान् भृशम्।<br />Employed in doing the behest's of the king, the twins never said anything that was disagreeable the old king. Then Dhritarashtra one day honoured his friends by his confidence. Addressing them with tearful eyes, he said these words.</p>
<p id='14'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच विदितं भवतामेतद् यथा वृत्तः कुरुक्षयः॥ ममापराधात् तत् सर्वमनुज्ञातं च कौरवैः।<br />Dhritarashtra said You know how the destruction of Kurus has happened. All that was brought about by my fault, though the Kauravas approved of all my counsels.</p>
<p id='15'>योऽहं दुष्टमतिं मन्दो ज्ञातीनां भयवर्धनम्॥ दुर्योधनं कौरवाणामाधिपत्यऽभ्यषेचयम्।<br />Fool that I was, I installed the wickedminded Duryodhana, that enhancer of the terrors of kinsmen, to rule over the Kurus.</p>
<p id='16'>यच्चाहं वासुदेवस्य नाश्रौषं वाक्यमर्थवत्॥ वध्यतां साध्वयं पापः सामात्य इति दुर्मतिः। पुत्रस्नेहाभिभूतस्तु हितमुक्तो मनीषिभिः॥ विदुरेणाथ भीष्मेण द्रोणेन च कृपेण च। पदे पदे भगवता व्यासेन च महात्मना॥ संजयेनाथ गान्धार्या तदिदं तप्यते च माम्।<br />Vasudeva had said to me, 'Let this sinful wretch of wicked understanding be slain along with all his friends and counselors.' I did not listen to those words of great significance. All wise men gave me the same beneficial advice. Vidura, Bhishina, Drona, and Kripa said the same thing. The holy and great Vyasa repeatedly said the same, as also Sanjaya and Gandhari. Overwhelmed, however, by filial affection, I could not follow that advice. Bitter repentance is now my lot for my neglect.</p>
<p id='17'>यच्चाहं पाण्डुपुत्रेषु गुणवत्सु महात्मसु॥ न दत्तवाश्रियं दीप्तां पितृपैतामहीमिमाम्।<br />I also repent for not having bestowed that blazing prosperity, derived from sires and grandsires on the great Pandavas possessed of every accomplishment.</p>
<p id='18'>विनाशं पश्यमानो हि सर्वराज्ञां गदाग्रजः॥ एतच्छ्रेयस्तु परमममन्यत जनार्दनः।<br />The eldest brother of Gada foresaw the destruction of all the king; Janardana, however, considered that destruction as highly beneficial.</p>
<p id='19'>सोऽहमेतान्यलीकानि निवृत्तान्यान्मनस्तदा।।२३। हृदये शल्यभूतानि धारयामि सहस्रशः।<br />So many battalions of troops belonging to me, have been destroyed! Alas, my heart is pierced with thousands of darts on account of all these results.</p>
<p id='20'>विशेषतस्तु पश्यामि वर्षे पञ्चदरोऽद्य वै॥ अस्य पापस्य शुद्ध्यर्थं नियतोऽस्मि सुदुर्मतिः।<br />Of wicked understanding as I am, now, after the lapse of fifteen years, I am trying to expiate my sins.</p>
<p id='21'>चतुर्थे नियते काले कदाचिदपि चाष्टमे॥ तृष्णाविनयनं भुजे गान्धारी वेद तन्मम।<br />Now at the fourth division of the day or sometimes at the eighth division, with the regularity of a vow, I eat a little food for simply satisfying my thirst. Gandhari knows this.</p>
<p id='22'>करोत्याहारमिति मां सर्वः परिजनः सदा॥ युधिष्ठिरभयादेति भृशं तप्यति पाण्डवः।<br />All my attendants believe that I eat as usual. Through feat of Yudhishthira alone I concealed my deeds, for if the eldest son of Pandu came to know of my vow, he would feel great pain.</p>
<p id='23'>भूमौ शये जप्यपरो दर्भेष्वजिनसंवृतः॥ नियमव्यपदेशेन गान्धारी च यशस्विनी।<br />Clad in deer-skin, I lie down on the Earth, spreading a small quantity of Kusha grass, and pass the time in silent recitations. The illustrious Gandhari, also, passes her time in the observance of similar vows.</p>
<p id='24'>हतं शतं तु पुत्राणां ययोर्युद्धेऽपलायिनाम्॥ नानुतप्यामि तच्चाहं क्षत्रधर्म हि ते विदुः।<br />Thus do we both act, we who have lost a hundred sons none of whom ever retreated from battle. I do not, however, grieve for those children of mine. They have all died while performing Kshatriya duties.</p>
<p id='25'>इत्युक्त्वा धर्मराजानमभ्यभाषत कौरवः॥ भद्रं ते यादवीमातर्वचश्चेदं निबोध मे।<br />Having said these words, the old king then addressed Yudhishthira in particular and said, 'Blessed by you, O son of the princess of Yudu's race! Listen now to what I say.</p>
<p id='26'>सुखमसम्युषितः पुत्र त्वया सुपरिपालितः॥ महादानानि दत्तानि श्राद्धानि च पुनः पुनः।<br />Cherished by you, O son, I have lived these years very happily. I have (with your help) made large gifts and performed Sharaddhas repeatedly.</p>
<p id='27'>प्रकृष्टं च यया पुत्र पुण्यं चीर्णं यथाबलम्॥ गान्धारी हतपुत्रेयं धैर्येणोदीक्षते च माम्।<br />I have, O son, to the best of my power, acquired merit largely. This Gandhari, though destitute of sons, has lived with great fortitude, loO king all the while at me.</p>
<p id='28'>द्रौपद्या ह्यपकर्तारस्तव चैश्वर्यहारिणः॥ समतीता नृशंसास्ते स्वधर्मेण हता युधि।<br />They who inflicted great wrongs on Draupadi and robbed you of your affluence, those cruel men-have all left the world, killed in battle according to the practice of their order.</p>
<p id='29'>न तेषु प्रतिकर्तव्यं पश्यामि कुरुनन्दन॥ सर्वे शस्त्रभृतां लोकान् गतास्तेऽभिमुखं हताः।<br />I have nothing to do for them, O delighter of the Kurus! Killed with their faces towards battle, they have attained to those regions which reserved for the wielders of weapons.</p>
<p id='30'>आत्मनस्तु हितं पुण्यं प्रतिकर्तव्यमद्य वै॥ गान्धार्याश्चैव राजेन्द्र तदनुज्ञातुमर्हसि।<br />I should now, do what is bencficial and meritorious for me as also for Gandhari. O great king, you should grant mc permission. are</p>
<p id='31'>त्वं तु शस्त्रभृतां श्रेष्ठः सततं धर्मवत्सलः॥ राजा गुरुः प्राणभृतां तस्मादेतद् ब्रवीम्यहम्।<br />You are the foremost of all righteous persons. You are always devoted to virtue. The king is the preceptor of all creatures. It is for this that I say so.</p>
<p id='32'>अनुज्ञातस्त्वया वीर संश्रयेयं वनान्यहम्॥ चीरवल्कलभृद् राजन् गान्धार्या सहितोऽनया।<br />With your permission, O hero, I shall retire into the forest, clad in rags and darks, O king, along with this Gandhari.</p>
<p id='33'>तवाशिषः प्रयुञ्जानो भविष्यामि वनेचरः॥ उचितं नः कुले तात सर्वेषां भरतर्षभ। पुत्रेष्वैश्वर्यमाधाय वयसोऽन्ते वनं नृप॥ तत्राहं वायुभक्षो वा निराहारोऽपि वा वसन्। पल्या सहानया वीर चरिष्यामि तपः परम्॥<br />I shall live in the forest, always blessing you. It is proper, O son, for the members of our family, to make over sovereignty, when old age comes, to children and lead the forest mode of life. Living there on air alone, or abstaining froin all food, I shall, with this wife of mine, O hero, practice severe austeities.</p>
<p id='34'>त्वं चापि फलभाक् तात तपसः पार्थिवो ह्यसि। फलभाजो हि राजानः कल्याणस्येतरस्य वा॥<br />You shall be a sharer of those penances, o son, for you are the king. Kings are sharers of both auspicious and inauspicious acts done in their kingdom.</p>
<p id='35'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच न मां प्रीणयते राज्यं त्वय्येवं दुःखिते नृप। धिङ्नामस्तु सुदुर्बुद्धिं राज्यसक्तं प्रमादिनम्॥<br />Yudhishthira said When you, O king, are thus subject to grief, sovereignty does not please me at all. Fie on me who am of wicked understanding, devoted o the pleasures of own and absolutely negligent of my true concerns.</p>
<p id='36'>योऽहं भवन्तं दुःखार्तमुपवासकृशं भृशम्। जिनाहारं क्षितिशयं न विन्दे भ्रातृभिः सह॥<br />Alas, I, with all my brothers, was ignorant of yourself having so long been stricken with grief, emaciated with fasts, abstaining from food, and lying on the naked earth.</p>
<p id='37'>अहोऽस्मि वञ्चितो मूढो भवता गूढबुद्धिना। विश्वासयित्वा पूर्वं मां यदिदं दुःखमश्नुथाः॥<br />Alas, foolish that I am, I have been deceived by you who have great intelligence, inasmuch as, having filled me with confidence at first you have latterly undergone such grief.</p>
<p id='38'>किं मे राज्येन भोगैर्वा किं यज्ञैः किं सुखेन वा। यस्य मे त्वं महीपाल दुःखान्येतान्यवाप्तवान्॥<br />What need have I of kingdom or of articles of enjoyment, what need of sacrifices or of happiness, when you, O king, have undergone so much affliction.</p>
<p id='39'>पीडितं चापि जानामि राज्यमान्मानमेव च। अनेन वचसा तुभ्यं दुःखितस्य जनेश्वर॥<br />I consider my kingdom as a disease, and myself also as afflicted. Plunged though I am in sorrow, what however, is the sue of these words that I am addressing you?</p>
