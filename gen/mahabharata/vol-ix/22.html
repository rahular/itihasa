<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 22</h3><h4>The proper object of gift</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच किमाहुर्भरतश्रेष्ठ पात्रं विप्राः सनातनाः। ब्राह्मणं लिङ्गिनं चैव ब्राह्मणं वाप्यलिङ्गिनम्॥<br />Yudhishthira said Whom have the eternal Brahmanas selected a proper object of gifts? Is a Brahmana who bears the marks of the order of life he follows to be considered as such, or is one divested of such marks to be so regarded.</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच स्ववृत्तिमभिपन्नाथ लिङ्गिने चेतराय च। देयमाहुर्महाराज उभावेतौ तपस्विनौ॥<br />Bhishma said O king it has been said that gifts should be made a Brahmana who follows the duties of his own order, whether he bears the marks of Brahmacharya or not, for both are faultless, viz., he who bears such marks and he who is divested of them.</p>
<p id='3'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच श्रद्धया परया पूतो यः प्रयच्छेद् द्विजातये। हव्यं कव्यं तथा दानं को दोषः स्यात् पितामह॥<br />Yudhishthira said What sin does an impure person commit if he makes gifts of sacrificial butter or food or with great devotion to persons of the twice born order?</p>
<p id='4'>भीष्म उवाच श्रद्धापूतो नरस्तात दुर्दान्तोऽपि न संशयः। पूतो भवति सर्वत्र किमुत त्वं महाद्युते॥<br />Bhishma said He who has no selfcontrol becomes, forsooth, cleansed by devotion. Such a man, becomes purified in respect of every act.</p>
<p id='5'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच न ब्राह्मणं परीक्षेत दैवेषु सततं नरः। कव्यप्रदाने तु बुधाः परीक्ष्यं ब्राह्मणं विदुः॥<br />Yudhishthira said It has been said that a Brahmana who is sought for the performance of a religious rite should never be examined. The learned however, hold that while performing rites for the Pitris the Brahmana who is sought to be engaged, should be examined.</p>
<p id='6'>भीष्म उवाच न ब्राह्मणं साध्यते हव्यं दैवात् प्रसिद्ध्यति। देवप्रसादादिज्यन्ते यजमानैर्न संशयः॥<br />Bhishma said As regards the religious rite for the deities these do not yield fruits on account of the Brahmana who is engaged in doing them but through the grace of the deities themselves. Forsooth, those persons who perform sacrifices acquire the merit of those acts, through the favour of the deities.</p>
<p id='7'>ब्राह्मणान् भरतश्रेष्ठ सततं ब्रह्मवादिनः। मार्कण्डेयः पुरा प्राह इति लोकेषु बुद्धिमान्॥<br />The Brahmanas, O chief of the Bharatas, are always Utters of Brahma. The intelligent Rishi Markandeya gave vent to these words in days of yore.</p>
<p id='8'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच अपूर्वोऽप्यथवा विद्वान् सम्बन्धी वा यथा भवेत्। तपस्वी यज्ञशीलो वा कथं पात्र भवेत् तु सः॥<br />Yudhishthira said Why, O grandfather, are these five viz., he who is a stranger, he who is gifted with learning, he who is connected by marriage, he that is endued with penances, and he who is devoted to the performance of sacrifices, considered as proper persons?</p>
<p id='9'>भीष्म उवाच कुलीनः कर्मकृद् वैद्यस्तथैवाप्यानृशंस्यवान्। ह्रीमानृजुः सत्यवादी पात्रं पूर्वं च ये त्रयः॥<br />Bhishma said The first three viz., strangers, relatives and ascetics, when endued with these attributes, viz., purity of birth devotion to religious acts, learning mercy modesty, sincerity and truthfulness, are considered as proper persons. The other two, viz., men of learning and those given to sacrifices when gifted with five of these attributes, viz., purity of birth, mercy, modesty, sincerity, and truthfulness, are also considered as proper persons.</p>
<p id='10'>तत्रेमं शृणु मे पार्थ चतुर्णां तेजसां मतम्। पृथिव्याः काश्यपस्याग्नेर्मार्कण्डेयस्य चैव हि॥<br />Listen now to me, O son of Pritha, as I recite to you the opinions of these four persons of great energy, viz., the goddess, Earth, the Rishi Kashyapa, the god of fire, and the ascetic Markandeya.</p>
<p id='11'>पृथ्वी उवाच यथा महार्णवे क्षिप्तः क्षिप्रं लेष्टुर्विनश्यति। तथा दुश्चरितं सर्वे त्रिवृत्यां च निमज्जति॥<br />The Earth said As a clod of earth when thrown into the great ocean quickly dissolves away so every sort of sin disappears by the three high qualifications of officiation at sacrifices teaching, and receiving of gifts.</p>
<p id='12'>कश्यप उवाच सर्वे च वेदाः सह षड्भिरङ्गैः सांख्यं पुराणं च कुले च जन्मा नैतानि सर्वाणि गतिर्भवन्ति शीलव्यपेतस्य नृप द्विजस्य॥<br />Kashyapa said The Vedas with their six auxiliaries the Sankhya philosophy, the Puranas, and high birth, these cannot rescue a twice born person if he falls away from good conduct.</p>
<p id='13'>अग्निरुवाच अधीयानः पण्डितं मन्यमानो यो विद्यया हन्ति यशः परेषाम्। प्रभ्रश्यतेऽसौ चरते न सत्यं लोकास्तस्य ह्यन्तवन्तो भवन्ति॥<br />Agni said The Brahmana who engaged in study and considering himself learned, seeks with the help of his learning to destroy the reputation of others falls away from virtue and comes to be regarded as divorced from truth. Such persons of refractory spirit never acquire regions of happiness hereafter.</p>
<p id='14'>मार्कण्डेय उवाच अश्वमेधसहस्रं च सत्यं च तुलया धृतम्। नाभिजानामि यद्यस्य सत्यस्यार्धमवाप्नुयात्॥<br />Markandeya said If a thousand Horse sacrifices and Truth were weighed in the balance, I do not know whether the former would equal even half of the latter in weight.</p>
<p id='15'>भीष्म उवाच इत्युक्त्वा ते जग्मुराशु चत्वारोऽमिततेजसः। पृथिवी काश्यपोऽग्निश्च प्रकृष्टायुश्च भार्गवः॥<br />Bhishma said Having spoken these words, those four persons, each of whom is gifted with immeasurable energy, viz., the goddess Earth, Kashyapa, Agni, and Bhrigu's son armed with weapons quickly went away.</p>
<p id='16'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच यदि ते ब्राह्मणा लोके वतिनो भुञ्जते हविः। दत्तं ब्राह्मणकामाय कथं तत् सुकृतं भवेत्॥१६<br />Yudhishinira said If Brahmanas observing the vow of celibacy in this world eat, begging the same the offerings one makes during funeral rites, I ask can the shraddha be considered wellperformed if the performer actually makes over those offerings to such Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='17'>भीष्म उवाच आदिष्टिनो ये राजेन्द्र ब्राह्मणा वेदपारगाः। भुञ्जते ब्रह्मकामाय व्रतलुप्ता भवन्ति ते॥<br />Bhishma said If, having practised the vow of Brahmacharya for the prescribed period (of twelve years) and acquired proficiency in the Vedas and their branches a Brahmana himself asks for the offerings made in Shraddhas and eats the same, he is considered to fall away from his vow. The Shraddha, however is not considered as sullied in any way.</p>
<p id='18'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच अनेकान्तं बहुद्वारं धर्ममाहुर्मनीषिणः। किंनिमित्तं भवेदत्र तन्मे बूहि पितामह॥<br />Yudhishthira said The wise hold that duty or virtue has many ends and numerous doors. Tell me, O grandfather what however are the decisions in this matter.</p>
<p id='19'>भीष्म उवाच अहिंसा सत्यमक्रोध आनृशंस्यं दमस्तथा। आर्जवं चैव राजेन्द्र निश्चितं धर्मलक्षणम्॥<br />Bhishma said Abstention from injury to others, truthfulness, the absence of anger, mercy, selfcontrol and sincerity or candour, o king, are the marks of virtue.</p>
<p id='20'>ये तु धर्मे प्रशंसन्तश्चरन्ति पृथिवीमिमाम्। अनाचरन्तस्तद् धर्मे संकरेऽभिरताः प्रभो॥<br />There are persons who wander over the Earth, lauding virtue but without practising what they preach and engaged all the while in sin, O king.</p>
<p id='21'>तेभ्यो हिरण्यं रत्नं वा गामश्वं वा ददाति यः। दश वर्षाणि विष्ठां स भुङ्क्ते निरयमास्थितः॥ मेदानां पुल्कसानां च तथैवान्तेवसायिनाम्। कृतं कर्माकृतं वापि रागमोहेन जल्पताम्॥<br />He who gives such persons gold or gems or king or horses has to sink in hell and there live for ten years, on the faces of such person as live upon the flesh of dead kine and buffaloes, of men called Pukkasas, of others who live in the outskirts of cities and villages, and of men who give out under the influence of anger and folly, the acts and omissions of others.</p>
<p id='22'>वैश्वदेवं च ये मूढा विप्राय ब्रह्मचारिणे। ददते नेह राजेन्द्र ते लोकान् भुञ्जतेऽशुभान्॥<br />Those foolish men who do not give a Brahmana observant of the VOW of SBrahmacharya the offerings made in Shraddhas (unto one's deceased ancestors), have to proceed, O king, into regions of great misery.</p>
<p id='23'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच किं परं ब्रह्मचर्ये च किं परं धर्मलक्षणम्। किं च श्रेष्ठतमं शौचं तन्मे ब्रूहि पितामह॥<br />Yudhishthira said Tell me, O grand father what is superior to Brahmacharya? What is the highest mark of virtue? what is the highest kind of purity?</p>
<p id='24'>भीष्म उवाच ब्रह्मचर्यात् परं तात मधुमांसस्य वर्जनम्। मर्यादायां स्थितो धर्मः शमश्चैवास्य लक्षणम्॥<br />Bhishma said I tell you, O son, that abstention from honey and meat is even superior to Brahmacharya. Virtue lies within boundaries. The best mark of virtue is Renunciation.</p>
<p id='25'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच कस्मिन् काले चरेद् धर्मे कस्मिन् कालेऽर्थमाचरेत्। कस्मिन् काले सुखी च स्यात् तन्मे ब्रूहि पितामह।।<br />Yudhishthira said In what time should one practise virtue? In what time should wealth be sought? In what time should pleasure be enjoyed? O grandfather, do tell me this.</p>
<p id='26'>भीष्म उवाच कल्यमर्थं निषेवेत ततो धर्ममनन्तरम्। पश्चात् कामं निषेवेत न च गच्छेत् प्रसङ्गिताम्॥<br />Bhishma said One should acquire riches the first part of his life. Then should one acquire virtue, and then enjoy pleasure. One should not, however, be addicted to any of these.</p>
<p id='27'>ब्राह्मणांश्चैव मन्येत गुरूंश्चाप्यभिपूजयेत्। सर्वभूतानुलोमश्च मृदुशील: प्रियंवदः॥<br />One should respect the Brahmanas, worship his preceptor and seniors, show mercy to all creatures, be of mild disposition and sweet speech.</p>
<p id='28'>अधिकारे यदनृतं यच्च राजसु पैशुनम्। गुरोचालीककरणं तुल्यं तद् ब्रह्महत्यया॥<br />To utter untruth in a court of justice to behave deceitfully towards the king, to act falsely towards preceptors and elders, are considered as equivalent to Brahmanicide.</p>
<p id='29'>प्रहरेन्न नरेन्द्रेषु न हन्याद् गां तथैव च। भ्रूणहत्यासमं चैव उभयं यो निषेवते॥<br />One should never do an act of violence to the king's body. Nor should one ever strike a cow. Both these offences are equal to the sin of foeticide.</p>
<p id='30'>नाग्निं परित्यजेज्जातु न च वेदान् परित्यजेत्। न च ब्राह्मणमाक्रोशेत् समं तद् ब्रह्महत्यया॥<br />One should never quit his (homa) fire. One should also renounce the study of the Vedas. One should never attack a Brahmana by words or decds. All these offences are equal to Brahmanicide.</p>
<p id='31'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच कीदृशाः साधवो विप्राः केभ्यो दत्तं महाफलम्। कीदृशानां च भोक्तव्यं तन्मे ब्रूहि पितामह॥<br />Yudhishthira said What kind of Brahinanas should be considered as good? Who are those Brahmanas by making presents to whom one may win great merit? What kind of Brahmanas are they whom one should feed? Tell me all this, O grandfather.</p>
<p id='32'>भीष्म उवाच अक्रोधना धर्मपरा: सत्यनित्या दमे रताः। तादृशा: साधवो विप्रास्तेभ्यो दत्तं महाफलम्॥<br />Bhishma said Those Brahmanas who are freed from anger, who are devoted to acts of virtue, who are firm in Truth, and who practise self-control, are considered as good. By making gifts to them one acquires great merit.</p>
<p id='33'>अमानिनः सर्वसहा दृढार्थी विजितेन्द्रियाः। सर्वभूतहिता मैत्रास्तेभ्यो दत्तं महाफलम्॥<br />One acquires great merit by making presents to such Brahmanas as are free from pride capable of bearing everything, firm in the pursuit of their objects, gifted with mastery over their senses, devoted, to the behoof of all creatures, and disposed to be friendly towards all.</p>
<p id='34'>अलुब्धाः शुचयो वैद्या ह्रीमन्तः सत्यवादिनः। स्वकर्मनिरता ये च तेभ्यो दत्तं महाफलम्॥<br />One acquires great merit by making gifts to such Brahmanas as are free from avarice, as are pure of heart and conduct, gifted with learning and modesty, truthful in speech and observant of their own duties as sanctioned in the scriptures.</p>
<p id='35'>साङ्गाश्च चतुरो वेदानधीते यो द्विजर्षभः। षड्भ्यः प्रवृत्तः कर्मभ्यस्तं पात्रमृषयो विदुः॥<br />The Rishis have declared that Brahmana to be a deserving object of gifts who studies the four Vedas with all their auxiliaries and is devoted to the six well known duties. One acquires great merit by making gifts to Brahmanas endued with such qualifications.</p>
<p id='36'>ये त्वेवगुणजातीयास्तेभ्यो दत्तं महाफलम्। सहस्रगुणमाप्नोति गुणार्हाय प्रदायकः॥<br />The man who makes gifts to a worthy Brahmana multiplies his merit a thousand fold. A single pious Brahmana gifted with wisdom and Vedic lore, observant of the duties laid down in the scriptures, and marked out by purity of conduct is capablu to rescue a whole family.</p>
<p id='37'>प्रज्ञाश्रुताभ्यां वृत्तेन शीलेन च समन्वितः। तारयेत कुलं सर्वमेकोऽपीह द्विजर्षभः॥ गामश्वं वित्तमन्नं व तद्विधे प्रतिपादयेत्। द्रव्याणि चान्यानि तथा प्रेत्यभावे न शोचति॥<br />One should make gifts of kine and horses and riches and food and other kinds of articles to Brahmana who is gifted with such qualifications. By making such gifts to such persons one acquires great happiness in the next world.</p>
<p id='38'>तारयेत कुलं सर्वमेकोऽयीह द्विजोत्तमः। किमङ्ग पुनरेवैते तस्मात् पात्रं समाचरेत्॥<br />As I have already told you, even one such Brahman can save the entire family to which the giver belongs. What need I say, therefore, O dear son of the merit of making gifts to many Brahmanas of such qualifications? In making gifts, thercfore, one should always select the object to whom the gift is to be made.</p>
<p id='39'>निशम्य च गुणोपेतं ब्राह्मणं साधुसम्मतम्। दूरादानाय्य सत्कृत्य सर्वतश्चापि पूजयेत्॥<br />Hearing of a Brahmana gifted with proper qualifications and respected by all good people, one should invite him even if he lives at a distance and welcoming him when he arrives one should adore him by all means in his power. making gifts, thercfore, one should always select the object to whom the gift is to be made.</p>
<p id='40'>निशम्य च गुणोपेतं ब्राह्मणं साधुसम्मतम्। दूरादानाय्य सत्कृत्य सर्वतश्चापि पूजयेत्॥<br />Hearing of a Brahmana gifted with proper qualifications and respected by all good people, one should invite him even if he lives at a distance and welcoming him when he arrives one should adore him by all means in his power.</p>
