<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 166</h3><h4>The instructions of Bhishma</h4><p id='1'>जनमेजय उवाच शरतल्पगते भीष्मे कौरवाणां धुरन्धरे। शयाने वीरशयने पाण्डवैः समुपस्थिते॥ युधिष्ठिरो महाप्राज्ञो भम पूर्वपितामहः। धर्माणामागमं श्रुत्वा विदित्वा सर्वसंशयान्॥<br />Janamejaya said When that foremost person among the Kauravas, viz., Bhishma was lying on a bed of arrows—a bed that is always coveted by heroes and when the Pandavas were sitting around him, my great Grandfather Yudhishthira of much wisdom, heard these expositions of mysteries about the subject of duty and had all his doubts removed.</p>
<p id='2'>दानानां च विधिं श्रुत्वा च्छिन्नधर्मार्थसंशयः। यदन्यदकरोद् विप्र तन्मे शंसितुमर्हसि॥<br />He heard also what the ordinances are about gifts, and thus had all his doubts removed about the topics of virtue and wealth. You should, O learned Brahmana, tell me now what else did the great Pandava king do.</p>
<p id='3'>वैशम्पायन उवाच अभून्मुहूर्ते स्तिमितं सर्वं तद्राजमण्डलम्। तूष्णीभूते ततस्तस्मिन् पटे चित्रमिवार्पितम्॥<br />Vaishampayana said When Bhishma became silent, the entire body of kings became perfectly silent. Indeed, they all sat motionless there, like figures painted on canvas.</p>
<p id='4'>मुहूर्तमिव च ध्यात्वा व्यासः सत्यवतीसुतः। नृपं शयानं गाड्यमिदमाह वचस्तदा॥ राजन् प्रकृतिमापन्नः कुरुराजो युधिष्ठिरः। सहितो भ्रातृभिः सर्वैः पार्थिवैश्चानुयायिभिः॥<br />Then Vyasa the son of Satyavati, having thought for a moment, addressed the royal son of Ganga, saying, O king, the Kuru king Yudhishthira has been restored to his own nature, with all his brothers and followers.</p>
<p id='5'>उपास्ते त्वां नरव्याघ्र सह कृष्णेन धीमता। तमिमं पुरयानाय समनुज्ञातुमर्हसि॥<br />With highly intelligent Krishna by his side he bends his head in respect to you. You should give him leave for returning to the city.</p>
<p id='6'>एवमुक्तो भगवता व्यासेन पृथिवीपतिः। युधिष्ठिरं सहामात्यमनुजज्ञे नदीसुतः॥<br />Thus addressed by the holy Vyasa, the royal son of Shantanu and Ganga dismissed Yudhishthira and his counsellors.</p>
<p id='7'>उवाच चैन मधुरं नृपं शान्तनवो नृपः। प्रविशस्व पुरीं राजन् व्येतु ते मानसो ज्वरः॥<br />Addressing his grandson in a sweet voice, the royal son of Shantanu, also said, Do you return to your city, O king, Let the fever of your heart be removed.</p>
<p id='8'>यजस्व विविधैर्यज्ञैर्वबन्नेः स्वाप्तदक्षिणैः। ययातिरिव राजेन्द्र श्रद्धादमपुरःसरः॥<br />Do you adore the celestials in various sacrifices distinguished by large gifts of food and riches like Yayati himself, O foremost of kings, gifted with devotion and selfcontrol.</p>
<p id='9'>क्षत्रधर्मरतः पार्थ पितॄन् देवांश्च तर्पय। श्रेयसा योक्ष्यसे चैव व्येतु ते मानसो ज्वरः॥<br />Devoted to the practices of the Kshatriya do you, O son of Pritha, please the departed manes and the celestials. You shall then acquire great benefits. Indeed let the fever of your heart be removed.</p>
<p id='10'>रञ्जयस्व प्रजाः सर्वाः प्रकृती: परिसान्त्वय। सुहृदः फलसत्कारैरर्चयस्व यथार्हतः॥<br />Do you please all your subjects. Do you assure them and establish peace among all. Do you also honour all your wellwishers with such rewards as they deserve.</p>
<p id='11'>अनु त्वां तात जीवन्तु मित्राणि सुहृदस्तथा। चैत्यस्थाने स्थितं वृक्षं फलवन्तमिव द्विजाः॥<br />Let all your friends and wellwishers live, depending on you for their means, as birds live, depending for their means upon a full grown tree laden with fruits and standing on a sacred spot.</p>
<p id='12'>आगन्तव्यं च भवता समये मम पार्थिव। विनिवृत्ते दिनकरे प्रवृत्ते चोत्तरायणे॥<br />When the hour comes for departure from this world, do you come here, O king, I shall relinquish my body when the Sun, stopping in his southward course, will begin to return northwards.</p>
<p id='13'>तथेत्युक्त्वा च कौन्तेयः सोऽभिवाद्य पितामहम्। प्रययौ सपरीवारो नगरं नागसाह्वयम्॥<br />The son of Kunti answered, 'So be it!' and saluted his grandfather with respect and then started with all his relatives and followers, for the city of Hastinapur.</p>
<p id='14'>धृतराष्ट्र पुरस्कृत्य गान्धारी च पतिव्रताम्। सह तैर्ऋषिभिः सर्वैतृभिः केशवेन च॥ पौरजानपदैश्चैव मन्त्रिवृद्धैश्च पार्थिव। प्रविवेश कुरुश्रेष्ठः पुरं वारणसाह्वयम्॥<br />Headed by Dhritarashtra and also Gandhari who was greatly devoted to her husband and accompanied by the Rishis and Keshava as also by the citizens and the inhabitants of the country and by his counsellors, O monarch, that foremost one of Kuru's race entered the city of Hastinapur.</p>
