What is happiness? What is sin? O holy one, O you of excellent vows, you should answer these questions of mine, O learned Rishi, correctly, truly, and accurately. Who else is there in this world than you who is capable of answering these questions?</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>ब्रूहि धर्मविदां श्रेष्ठ परं कौतूहलं मम। मोक्षधर्मार्थकुशलो भवाँल्लोकेषु गीयते॥<br />Do you answer them, o foremost of all persons knowing duties! My curiosity is great. you are celebrated in all the worlds as one well-skilled in the duties about liberation.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>सर्वसंशयसंच्छेत्ता त्वदन्यो न च विद्यते। संसारभीरवश्चैव मोक्षकामास्तथा वयम्॥<br />There is none else save you who can remove all kinds of doubts. Afraid of worldly life, we have become desirous of acquiring Liberation.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>वासुदेव उवाच तस्मै सम्प्रतिपन्नाय यथावत् परिपृच्छते। शिष्याय गुणयुक्ताय शान्ताय प्रियवर्तिने॥ छायाभूताय दान्ताय यतते ब्रह्मचारिणे। तान् प्रश्नानब्रवीत् पार्थ मेधावी स धृतव्रतः। गुरुः कुरुकुलश्रेष्ठ सम्यक् सर्वानरिंदम॥<br />Vasudeva said To that disciple who had humbly sought his instruction and put the questions duly. Who was devoted to his preceptor and endued with tranquillity, and who always acted in a manner that was agreeable (to his instructor), who lived so constantly by the side of his instructor as to have almost become his shadow, who was selfcontrolled and who had the life of a Yati and a Brahmacharin, O son of Pritha, that preceptor gifted with intelligence and observant of vows, duly explained all the questions, O foremost of Kuru's race, O chastiser of all enemies.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>गुरुरुवाच ब्रह्मणोक्तमिदं सर्वमृषिप्रवरसेवितम्। वेदविद्यां समाश्रित्य तत्त्वभूतार्थभावनम्॥<br />All this was declared by Brahman himself. Applauded and practised by the foreinost of Rishis, and depending on Vedic knowledge it involves a consideration of what forms the real entity.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>ज्ञानं त्वेव परं विद्यः संन्यासं तप उत्तमम्। यस्तु वेद निराबाधं ज्ञानतत्त्वं विनिश्चयात्। सर्वभूतस्थमात्मानं स सर्वगतिरिष्यते॥ यो विद्वान् सहसंवासं विवासं चैव पश्यति। तथैवैकत्वनानात्वे स दुःखात् परिमुच्यते॥ यो न कामयते किंचिन्न किंचिदभिमन्यते। इहलोकस्थ एवैष ब्रह्मभूयाय कल्पते॥ प्रधानगुणतत्त्वज्ञः सर्वभूतविधानवित्। निर्ममो निरहङ्कारो मुच्यते नात्र संशयः॥ अव्यक्तबीजप्रभवो बुद्धिस्कन्धमयो महान्। महाहङ्कारविटप इन्द्रियाकुरकोटरः॥ महाभूतविशेषश्च विशेषप्रतिशाखवान्। सदापर्णः सदापुष्पः सदा शुभफलोदयः॥ अजीवः सर्वभूतानां ब्रह्मबीजः सनातनः। एतज्ज्ञात्वा च तत्त्वानि ज्ञानेन परमासिना॥ छित्त्वा चामरतां प्राप्य जहाति मृत्युजन्मनी।<br />We regard knowledge to be that highest object, and renunciation as the best penance. He who, certainly, knows the true object of knowledge which is incapable of being modified by circumstances, viz., the soul living in all creatures, succeeds in going wherever he likes and comes to be considered as the highest. That learned man who sees the residence of all things in one place and their severance as well, and who sees unity in diversity, succeeds in freeing himself from misery. He who does not long for anything and does not cherish the idea of mineness abut any thing, comes to be considered, although living in this world, as being at one with Brahina. He who knows the truth about the qualities of Nature, acquainted with the creation of all existent objects, divested of egoism, and without pride, succeeds, forsooth, in freeing himself. Understanding properly that great tree which has the unmanifest for its seed-sprout and the understanding for its trunk, and high consciousness of self for its branches, and the senses for the cells whence its twigs issue and the (five) great elements for its flower-buds, and the gross elements for its smaller boughs, which has leaves, which always puts forth flowers, and upon which all existent objects depend, whose seeds is Brahma, and which is eternal, and cutting all subjects with the sharp sword of knowledge, one acquires immortality and renounces birth and death.</p>

They thus assembled together after having travelled over all paths and after they had got tired with the deeds each of them had done.</p>

They live by penance (or action). Understand this, O you of excellent vows! On account of their own actions they live, transcending their own origin.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>सत्यं हि गुणसंयुक्तं नियतं पञ्चलक्षणम्॥ ब्रह्म सत्यं तपः सत्यं सत्यं चैव प्रजापतिः।<br />For Truth when united with qualities becomes always possessed of five marks. Brahman is Truth. Penance is truth. Prajapati is truth.</p>

Truth is the universe of being. It is for this that Brahmanas who are always devoted to Yoga, who have got over anger and sorrow, and who always consider Religion as the causeway, take refuge in Truth. I shall now speak of those Brahmanas who are controlled by one another and endued with knowledge, of the orders, and of those who belong to the four modes of life.</p>
