<h3>PUTRA-DARSHANA PARVA: Chapter 30</h3><h4>The history of Karna described by Kunti</h4><p id='1'>कुन्त्युवाच भगवश्वशुरो मेऽसि दैवतस्यापि दैवतम्। स मे देवातिदेवस्त्वं शृणु सत्या गिरं मम॥<br />Kunti said O holy one, you are my father-in-law and, therefore, my deity of deities. You are my god of gods. Hear my words of truth.</p>
<p id='2'>तपस्वी कोपनो विप्रो दुर्वासा नाम मे पितुः। भिक्षामुपातो भोक्तुं तमहं पर्यतोषयम्॥ शौचेन त्वागसस्त्यागैः शुद्धेन मनसा तथा। कोपस्थानेष्वपि महत्स्वकुष्यन्न कदाचन।॥<br />A twice-born ascetic named Durvasas, who is full of anger, came to my father's house for begging alms. I succeeded in pleasing him by the purity of my conduct and of my minds as also by refusing to notice the many wrongs he did. I did not yield to anger although there was much in his conduct quite capable of exciting that passion.</p>
<p id='3'>स प्रीतो वरदो मेऽभूत् कृतकृत्यो महामुनिः। अवश्यं ते गृहीतव्यमिति मां सोऽब्रवीद् वचः॥<br />Served with care, the great ascetic became highly pleased with me and disposed to grant me a boon. 'You must accept the boon I shall give,' were his words to me.</p>
<p id='4'>ततः शापभयाद् विप्रमवोचं पुनरेव तम्। एवमस्त्विति च प्राह पुनरेव स मे द्विजः॥ धर्मस्य जननी भद्रे भवित्री त्वं शुभानने। वशे स्थास्यन्ति ते देवा यांस्त्वमावाहयिष्यसि॥<br />Fearing his curse, I answered him saying, 'So be it.' The Rishi once more said to me, '0 blessed damsel, O you of beautiful face, you will become the mother of Dharma. Those deities whom you will summon will obey you,</p>
<p id='5'>इत्युक्त्वान्तर्हितो विप्रस्ततोऽहं विस्मिताभवम्। न च सर्वास्ववस्थासु रमृतिर्मे विप्रणश्यति॥<br />Having said these words, the twice-born one vanished away from my sight. I becamefilled with wonder. The Mantra, however, which the Rishi gave has lived in my memory at all times.</p>
<p id='6'>अथ हर्म्यतलस्थाहं रविमुद्यन्तमीक्षती। संस्मृत्य तदृषेर्वाक्यं स्पृहयन्ती दिवानिशम्॥<br />One day, sitting with my chamber I saw the sun rising. Desiring to bring the maker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi.</p>
<p id='7'>स्थिताऽहं बालभावेन तत्र दोषमबुद्ध्यती। अथ देवः सहस्रांशुमत्समीपगतोऽभवत्॥<br />Without any consciousness of the fault I committed, I called the deity from mere childishness. The deity, of a thousand rays, before me.</p>
<p id='8'>द्विधा कृत्वाऽऽत्मनो देहं भूमौ च गगनेऽपि च। तताप लोकानेकेन द्वितीयेनागमत् स माम्॥<br />He divided himself in two parts. With one portion he was in the sky, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me. With one he hearted the worlds and with another he came to came me.</p>
<p id='9'>स मामुवाच वेपन्तीं वरं मत्तो वृणीष्व ह। गम्यतामिति तं चाहं प्रणम्य शिरसाऽवदम्॥<br />He told me, while I was trembling at his sight, these words:-Do you ask a boon of me.' Bowing to him with my head I asked him to leave me.</p>
<p id='10'>स मामुवाच तिग्मांशुवृथाऽऽह्वानं न मे क्षमम्। धक्ष्यामि त्वां च विप्रं च येन दत्तो वरस्तव॥<br />He replied to me, saying, 'I cannot bear the idea of coming to you fruitlessly, I shall consume you as also that Brahmana who gave you the Mantra as a boon.</p>
<p id='11'>तमहं रक्षती विप्रं शापादनपकारिणम्। पुत्रो मे त्वत्समो देव भवेदिति ततोऽब्रवम्॥<br />I wished to protect, from Surya's curse, the Brahmana who had done no evil. I, therefore, said, 'Let me have a son like you, O god.'</p>
<p id='12'>ततो मां तेजसाऽऽविश्य मोहयित्वा च भानुमान् । उवाच भविता पुत्रस्तवेत्यभ्यगमद् दिवम्॥<br />The deity o. thousand rays then entered me with his energy and stupefied me completely. He then said to me, 'You will have a son, and then returned to the firmament.</p>
<p id='13'>ततोऽहमन्तर्भवने पितुर्वृत्तान्तरक्षिणी। गूढोत्पन्नं सुतं बालं जले कर्णमवासृजम्॥<br />I continued to live in the inner apartments and desirous of saving the honour of my father, I cast into the waters my infant son named Karna who thus came into the world secretly.</p>
<p id='14'>नूनं तस्येव देवस्य प्रसादात् पुनरेव तु। कन्याऽहमभवं विप्र यथा प्राह स मामृषिः॥<br />Forsooth, through the grace of that god, I once more became a virgin, Otwice-born one, even as the Rishi Durvasas he said to me.</p>
<p id='15'>स मया मूढया पुत्रो ज्ञायमानोऽप्युपेक्षितः। तन्मां दहति विप्रर्षे यथा सुविदितं तव॥<br />Foolish that I am, although he knew me for his mother when he grew up, yet I did not try to acknowledge him. This burns me, O Rishi, as is well-known to you.</p>
<p id='16'>यदि पापमपापं वा तवैतद् विवृतं मया। तन्मे दहन्तं भगवन् व्यपनेतुं त्वमर्हसि॥<br />Whether it is sinful or not so, I have told you the truth. You should. O holy one, satisfy the craving I feel for seeing that son of mine.</p>
<p id='17'>यच्चास्य राज्ञो विदितं हृदिस्थं भवतोऽनघ। तं चायं लभतां काममद्यैव मुनिसत्तम॥<br />O foremost of ascetics, let this king also, O sinless one, obtain the fruition today of that desire of his which he cherishes in his bosom and which has become known to you.'</p>
<p id='18'>इत्युक्तः प्रत्युवाचेदं व्यासो वेदविदां वरः। साधु सर्वमिदं भाव्यमेवमेतद् यथाऽऽत्य माम्॥<br />are Thus addressed by Kunti, Vyasa, that foremost of all persons, said to her in reply, "Blessed be you, all that you have said to me will happen.</p>
<p id='19'>अपराधश्च ते नास्ति कन्याभावं गता ह्यसि। देवाश्चैश्चर्यवन्तो वै शरीराण्याविशन्ति वै॥<br />You are not a biame at all. You were restored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) power. They are able enter human bodies.</p>
<p id='20'>सन्ति देवनिकायाश्च संकल्पाज्जनयन्ति ये। वाचा दृष्ट्या तथा स्पर्शात् संघर्षेणेति पञ्चधा।॥<br />There many deities. They beget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by sexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods.</p>
<p id='21'>मनुष्यधर्मो दैवेन धर्मेण हि न दुष्यति। इति कुन्ति विजानीहि व्येतु ते मानसो ज्वरः॥<br />You belong to the order of humanity. You have no fault. Know this, O Kunti! Let the fever of your heart be removed.</p>
<p id='22'>सर्वं बलवतां पथ्यं सर्वं बलवतां शुचि। सर्वं बलवतां धर्मः सर्वं बलवतां स्वकम्॥<br />Everything is becoming for those who are mighty. Everything is pure for those that are mighty. Everything is meritorious for those that are mighty. Everything is their own for those who are mighty.</p>
