<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 19</h3><h4>The declaration about joint duties on the occasion of a person's marriage. The discourse between Asthavakra and Disha</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच यदिदं सहधर्मेति प्रोच्यते भरतर्षभ। पाणिग्रहणकाले तु स्त्रीणामेतत् कथं स्मृतम्॥<br />Yudhishthira said I ask, O foremost of Bharata's race, what is the origin of the declaration, about satisfying all duties jointly, which is made on the occasion of person's marriage.</p>
<p id='2'>आर्ष एष भवेद् धर्मः प्राजापत्योऽथवाऽऽसुरः। यदेतत् सहधर्मेति पूर्वमुक्तं महर्षिभिः॥<br />Is that declaration about satisfying all duties together due only to what is laid down by the great Rishis in days of yore, or does it refer to the duty of procreating children from religious motives, or has it reference to only the carnal pleasure that is expected from such an intercourse of the sexes?</p>
<p id='3'>संदेहः सुमहानेष विरुद्ध इति मे मतिः। इह यः सहधर्मो वै प्रेत्यायं विहितः क्व नु॥<br />Grcat is the doubt that fills my mind about. Indeed, I think that the declaration to which I refer is contrary to the natural impulses which lead to a union of the sexes. The union in this world for performing duties together ceases with death and is not to be seen to exit hereafter.</p>
<p id='4'>स्वर्गो मृतानां भवति सहधर्मः पितामह। पूर्वमेकस्तु म्रियते क्व चैकस्तिष्ठते वद।॥<br />This union for doing all duties together leads to heaven. But heaven, O grandfather, is attained to by persons that are dead. It is seen of a married couple that only one dies at a time. Where does the other then remain. Do tell me this.</p>
<p id='5'>नानाधर्मफलोपेता नानाकर्मनिवासिताः। नानानिरयनिष्ठान्ता मानुषा बहवो यदा॥<br />Men obtain various kinds of fruits by performing various kinds of duties. The occupations, again, to which men-follow are of various kinds. Various, again are the hells to which they go on account of such diversity of duties and acts.</p>
<p id='6'>अनृताः स्त्रिय इत्येवं सूत्रकारो व्यवस्यति। यदानृताः स्त्रियस्तात सहधर्मः कुतः स्मृतः॥<br />The Rishis have said that women, in particular are false in behaviour. When human beings are such, land when women in particular are described in the Shastras to be false, how, O sire, can there be a union between the sexes for purposes of performing all duties together.</p>
<p id='7'>अनृताः स्त्रिय इत्येवं वेदेष्वपि हि पठ्यते। धर्मोऽयं पूर्विका संज्ञा उपचारःक्रियाविधिः॥<br />In the very Vedas one may read that women are false, The word 'Duty', as used in the Vedas, appears to have been coined first for general application. Therefore the application of that word to the rites of marriage is, instead of being correct, only a form of speech forcibly applied where it has no application.</p>
<p id='8'>गह्वरं प्रतिभात्येतन्मम चिन्तयतोऽनिशम्। नि:संदेहमिदं सर्वं पितामह यथाश्रुति॥ यदैतद् यादृशं चैतद् यथा चैतत् प्रवर्तितम्। निखिलेन महाप्राज्ञ भवानेतद् ब्रवीतु मे॥<br />The subject appears to be inexplicable although I think of it always. O grandfather, O you of great wisdom, you should explain this to me fully, clearly and according to the Shruti. In fact, do you explain to me what it is, what its characteristics are, and the way in which it has come to pass. to me</p>
<p id='9'>भीष्म उवाच अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। अष्टावक्रस्य संवादं दिशया सह भारत॥<br />Bhishma said Regarding it is cited the old discourse between Ashtavakra and the lady known by the name of Disha.</p>
<p id='10'>निर्वेष्टुकामस्तु पुरा अष्टावक्रो महातपाः। ऋषेरथ वदान्यस्य ववे कन्यां महात्मनः॥<br />Formerly Ashtavakra of austere penances, desirous of marriage, begged the great Rishi Vadanya of his daughter.</p>
<p id='11'>सुप्रभां नाम वै नाम्ना रूपेणाप्रतिमां भुवि। गुणप्रभावशीलेन चारित्रेण च शोभनाम्॥<br />The name by which the lady was known was Suprabha. In beauty she was peerless on Earth. In virtues dignity, conduct, and manners, she was superior to all girls.</p>
<p id='12'>सा तस्य दृष्वैव मनो जहार शुभलोचना। वनराजी यथा चित्रा वसन्ते कुसुमाचिता॥<br />By a look only that girl of beautiful eyes had robbed him of his heart even as a delightful grove in spring, decked with flowers robs the spectator of his heart.</p>
<p id='13'>ऋषिस्तमाह देया मे सुता तुभ्यं हि तच्छृणु। गच्छ तावद् दिशं पुण्यामुत्तरां द्रक्ष्यसे ततः॥<br />The Rishi addressed Ashtavakra and said Yes, I shall give my daughter to you. Listen, however, to me. Make a journey to the sacred North. You will see inany things there.</p>
<p id='14'>अष्टवक्र उवाच किं द्रष्टव्यं मया तत्र वक्तुमर्हति मे भवान्। तथेदानी मया कार्यं यथा वक्ष्यति मां भवान्॥<br />Ashtavakra said You should tell me what I shall see in that region. Indeed, I am ready to carry out whatever command may be laid upon me by you.</p>

<p id='16'>संहृष्टैः पार्षदैर्जुष्टं नृत्यद्भिर्विविधाननैः। दिव्याङ्गरागैः पैशाचैरन्यैर्नानाविधैः प्रभोः॥ पाणितालसुतालैश्च शम्पातालैः समैस्तथा। सम्प्रहृष्टैः प्रनृत्यद्भिः शर्वस्तत्र निषेव्यते॥<br />It is full of the companions of Mahadeva, frolicsome and fond of dance and possessed of various faces. It is peopled with also many Pishachas, O lord, of various forms and all daubed with fragrant powders of various colours and dancing with joyous hearts in accompaniment with brazen instruments of different kinds. Encircled by these who dance with electric rapidity or refrain at times altogether from forward or backward or transverse motion of every sort, Mahadeva lives there.</p>
<p id='17'>इष्टं किल गिरौ स्थानं तद्दिव्यमिति शुश्रुम। नित्यं संनिहितो देवस्तथा ते पार्षदाः स्मृताः॥<br />That charining spot on the mountains, we have heard, is the favourite abode of the great god. It is said that great god as his companions are always present there.</p>
<p id='18'>तत्र देव्या तपस्तप्तं शङ्करार्थं सुदुश्चरम्। अतस्तदिष्टं देवस्य तथोमाया इति श्रुतिः॥<br />It was there that the goddess Uma had practised the severest austerities for the sake of the three-eyed god. Hence, it is said, that spot is much liked by both Mahadeva and Uma.</p>
<p id='19'>पूर्वं तत्र महापार्श्वे देवस्योत्तरतस्तथा। ऋतवः कालरात्रिश्च ये दिव्या ये च मानुषाः॥ देवं चोपासते सर्वे रूपिणः किल तत्र ह। तदतिक्रम्य भवनं त्वया यात्वयमेव हि॥<br />Formerly there, on the summit of the Mahaparshva mountains, which are situate to the north of the mountains sacred to Mahadeva, the Seasons, and the last Night, and many gods, and many human beings also in their embodied forms, had worshipped Mahadeva. You will cross that region also in your northward journey.</p>

There in that forest, you will see a beautiful female ascetic loO king like the goddess of prosperity herself.</p>

Verily, I shall proceed to that region of which you mention, O you righteous soul! On your side, you should make your words truthful.</p>

His ablutions being over, he spread a quantity of Kusha grass and laid himself down upon it for taking rest for some time.</p>

All this befits you, O Lord of Riches. Through your grace, O illustrious one, and according to the command of the great Rishi Vadanya, I shall now proceed to my journey's end.

There also were seen many selfluminous gems, and the soil all around was decked with diamonds of various species.</p>

Those chambers were adorned also with nets of pearls interspersed with jewels and gems of various species.</p>

<p id='58'>ततस्तस्याभवच्चिन्ता कुत्र वासो भवेदिति। अथ द्वारं समभितो गत्वा स्थित्वा ततोऽब्रवीत्॥<br />Seeing these beautiful sights all around, the Rishi began to think of where he would take shelter. Proceeding then to the gate of the palace, he uttered these words:</p>
<p id='59'>अतिथिं समनुप्राप्तमभिजानन्तु येऽत्र वै। अथ कन्याः परिवृता गृहात् तस्माद् विनिर्गताः॥<br />Let those that live here know that a guest has come. Hearing the voice of the Rishi, a number of maidens came out in a body from that palace.</p>
<p id='60'>नानारूपाः सप्त विभो कन्याः सर्वा मनोहराः। यां यामपश्यत् कन्यां वै सा सा तस्य मनोऽहरत्॥६८<br />They were seven in number, O king, Of different sorts of beauty, all of them were highly charming. Every one of those maidens the Rishi saw stole his heart.</p>
<p id='61'>न च शक्तो वारयितुं मनोऽस्याथावसीदति। ततो धृतिः समुत्पन्ना तस्य विप्रस्य धीमतः॥<br />The sage could not, with even his utmost struggles control his mind. Indeed, seeing those maidens of very great beauty, his heart lost its balance. Seeing himself to give way to such influences, the Rishi made a vigorous effort, and greatly wise as he was he at last succeeded in controlling himself.</p>
<p id='62'>अथ तं प्रमदाः प्राहुर्भगवान् प्रविशत्विति। स च तासां सुरूपाणां तस्यैव भवनस्य हि॥ कौतूहलं समाविष्टः प्रविवेश गृहं द्विजः। तत्रापश्यज्जरायुक्तामरजोऽम्बरधारिणीम्॥ वृद्धां पर्यङ्कमासीनां सर्वाभरणभूषिताम्। स्वस्तीति तेन चैवोक्ता सा स्त्री प्रत्यवदत् तदा॥ प्रत्युत्थाय च तं विप्रमास्यतामित्युवाच ह।<br />Those ladies then addressed the Rishi saying Let the illustrious one enter. Stricken with curiously about those highly beautiful ladies, as also of that palace the twiceborn Rishi entered as he was commanded. Entering the palace lie saw an old lady, with marks of decrepitude, dressed in white robes and adorned with every kind of ornament. The Rishi blessed her, saying Good be to you. The old lady returned his good wishes in due form, Rising up, she offered a seat to the Rishi.</p>
<p id='63'>सर्वाः स्वानालयान् यान्तु एका मामुपतिष्ठतु॥ प्रज्ञाता या प्रशान्ता या शेषा गच्छन्तु च्छन्दतः।<br />Having taken his seat, Ashtavakra said Let all the ladies go to their respective quarters. Only let one stay here. Let that one remain here who is endued with wisdom and who has tranquillity of heart. Indeed, let all the others go away as they like,</p>
<p id='64'>ततः प्रदक्षिणीकृत्य कन्यास्तास्तमृषि तदा॥ निश्चक्रमुर्गृहात् तस्मात् सा वृद्धार्थं व्यतिष्ठत।<br />Thus addressed, all those damsels went round the Rishi and then left the chamber, only that aged lady remaining there.</p>
<p id='65'>अथ तां संविशन् प्राह शयने भास्वरे तदा॥ त्वयापि सुप्यतां भद्रे रजनी ह्यतिवर्तते।<br />The day quickly passed and night came. The Rishi, seated on a splendid bed addressed the old lady, saying blessed lady, the night is growing deeper, Do you go to sleep.</p>
<p id='66'>संलापात् तेन विप्रेण तथा सा तत्र भाषिता॥ द्वितीये शयने दिव्ये संविवेश महाप्रभे।<br />Their conversation being thus put a stop to by the Rishi the old lady laid herself down on an excellent bed of great beauty.</p>
<p id='67'>अथ सा वेपमानाङ्गी निमित्तं शीतजं तदा॥ व्यपदिश्य महर्षेः शयनं व्यवरोहत।<br />Soon after, she rose from her bed and pretending to tremble with cold, left it for the bed of the Rishi.</p>
<p id='68'>स्वागतेनागतां तां तु भगवानभ्यभाषत॥ सोपागूहद् भुजाभ्यां तु ऋषि प्रीत्या नरर्षभ।<br />The great Ashtavakra welcomed her courteously. The lady, however stretching her arms, tenderly embraced the Rishi, O foremost of men.</p>
<p id='69'>निर्विकारमृर्षि चापि काष्ठकुड्योपमं तदा॥ दुःखिता प्रेक्ष्य संजल्पमकार्षीदृषिणा सह।<br />Seeing the Rishi quite unmoved and as inanimate as a piece of wood, she became very sorry and began to converse with him.</p>
<p id='70'>ब्रह्मन्नकामतोऽन्यास्ति स्त्रीणां पुरुषतो धृतिः॥ कामेन मोहिता चाहं त्वां भजन्तीं भजस्व माम्।<br />There is no pleasure, except that from desire which women can derive from a person of the other sex! I am now under the influence of lust. I seek you for that reason. Do you seek me in return.</p>
<p id='71'>प्रहृष्टो भव विप्रर्षे समागच्छ मया सह॥ उपगूह च मां विप्र कामार्ताहं भृशं त्वयि।<br />Be cheerful O learned Rishi, and unite yourself with me! Do you embrace me, o learned one for I desire you greatly.</p>

At the first sight I have become disposed to seek you. Do you also seek me.</p>
<p id='73'>मम चेदं धनं सर्वे यच्चान्यदपि पश्यसि॥ प्रभुस्त्वं भव सर्वत्र मयि चैव न संशयः।<br />All this riches and every other precious article that you see these are mine. Do you indeed, become the master of all this with my person and heart.</p>
<p id='74'>सर्वान् कामान् विधास्यामि रमस्व सहितो मया।।८४ रमणीये वने विप्र सर्वकामफलप्रदे।<br />I Shall satisfy every wish of yours! Do you sport with me, therefore, in these delightful forests, O Brahmana, which can grant every wish.</p>
<p id='75'>त्वद्वशाहं भविष्यामि रंस्यसे च मया सह॥ सर्वान् कामानुपाश्नीमो ये दिव्या ये च मानुषाः।<br />I shall obey you implicitly in every thing and you will sport with me according to your pleasure! All objects of desire that are human or that belong to heaven shall be enjoyed by us.</p>
<p id='76'>नातः परं हि नारीणां विद्यते च कदाचन॥ यथा पुरुषसंसर्गः परमेतद्धि नः फलम्।<br />There is no other pleasure more agreeable to women. Indeed, union with a person of the opposite sex is the most desirable object of joy that we can get.</p>
<p id='77'>आत्मच्छन्देन वर्तन्ते नार्यो मन्मथचोदिताः॥ न च दह्यन्ति गच्छन्त्यः सुतप्तैरपि पांसुभिः।<br />When moved by the god of love women become very whimsical. Then they do not feel any pain even they walk over a desert of burning sand.</p>
<p id='78'>अष्टावक्र उवाच परदारनहं भद्रे न गच्छेयं कथंचन॥ दूषितं धर्मशास्त्रज्ञैः परदाराभिमर्शनम्।<br />Ashtavakra said O blessed lady, I never approach another's wife. One's union with another man's wife is condemned by persons conversant with the scriptures on morality.</p>
<p id='79'>भद्रे निवेष्टुकामं मां विद्धि सत्येन वै शपे॥ विषयेष्वनभिज्ञोऽहं धर्मार्थं किल संततिः।<br />I am an utter stranger to enjoyments of every kind. O blessed lady, know that I have become desirous of marriage for getting children. I swear by truth itself.</p>
<p id='80'>एवं लोकान् गमिष्यामि पुत्रैरिति न संशयः॥ भद्रे धर्मे विजानीहि ज्ञात्वा चोपरमस्व ह।<br />Through the help of offspring righteously got, I shall proceed to those regions of happiness which cannot be attained without such help. O good lady, know what is consistent with morality, and knowing desist from your efforts.</p>
<p id='81'>स्व्युवाच नानिलोऽग्निर्न वरुणो न चान्ये त्रिदशा द्विज॥ प्रियाः स्त्रीणां यथा कामोरतिशीला हि योषितः।<br />The lady said The very gods of wind and fire and water, or the other celestials, O twice born one are not so agreeable to women as the god of love. Indeed women are greatly fond of sexual union.</p>
<p id='82'>सहस्रे किल नारीणां प्राप्येतैका कदाचन॥ तथा शतसहस्रेषु यदि काचित् पतिव्रता।<br />Among a thousand women, or perhaps, among hundreds of thousands, sometimes only one may be found who is devoted to her husband.</p>
<p id='83'>नैता जानन्ति पितरं न कुलं न च मातरम्॥ न भ्रातॄन् न च भर्तारं न च पुत्रान् न देवरान्।<br />Under the influence of desire, they care not for fainily or father or mother or brother or husband or sons or husband's brother.</p>
<p id='84'>लीलायन्त्यः कुलं घ्नन्ति कूलानीव सरिद्वराः। दोषान् सर्वांश्च मत्वाऽऽशु प्रजापतिरभाषत॥<br />Seeking what they consider happiness, they destroy the family even as many rivers wash away the banks that contain them. The Creator himself had said this marking the faults of women.</p>
<p id='85'>भीष्म उवाच ततः स ऋषिरेकाग्रस्तां स्त्रियं प्रत्यभाषत। आस्यतां रुचितश्छन्दः किं च कार्यं ब्रवीहि मे॥<br />Bhishma said The Rishi, bent upon finding out the faults of women, addressed that lady saying Cease to speak to me thus! Yearning originates from liking. Tell ine what I am to do.</p>
<p id='86'>सा स्त्री प्रोवाच भगवन् द्रक्ष्यसे देशकालतः। वस तावन्महाभाग कृतकृत्यो भविष्यसि॥<br />That lady then said in return illustrious one you will all see according to time and place. Do you only live here (for sometime), O highly blessed one, and I shall consider myself sufficiently rewarded!</p>
<p id='87'>ब्रह्मर्पिस्तामथोवाच स तथेति युधिष्ठिर। वत्स्येऽहं यावदुत्साहो भवत्या नात्र संशयः॥ अथर्षिरभिसम्प्रेक्ष्य स्त्रियं तां जरयार्दिताम्। चिन्तां परमिकां भेजे संतप्त इव चाभवत्॥<br />Thus addressed by her, the twice born Rishi, O Yudhishthira, expressed his resolution to satisfy her request, saying I shall live with you in this place as long as I can venture to do so. The Rishi then seeing that lady possessed by decrepitude, began to think seriously on the matter. He appeared to be even pained by his thoughts.</p>
<p id='88'>यद् यदकं हि सोऽपश्यत् तस्या विप्रर्षभस्तदा। नारमत् तत्र तत्रास्य दृष्टी रूपविरागिता॥<br />The eyes of that foremost of Brahmanas could not get any delight from those parts of that lady's person whereupon they were fixed. On the other hand, his looks appeared to be dispelled by the ugliness of those particular limbs.</p>
<p id='89'>देवतेयं गृहस्यास्य शापात् किं नु विरूपिता। अस्याश्च कारणं वेत्तुं न युक्तं सहसा मया॥<br />This lady is forsooth, the mistress of this palace. Has she been made ugly through some curse! It is not proper that I should quickly determine the cause of this.</p>
<p id='90'>इति चिन्ताविविक्तस्य तमर्थे ज्ञातुमिच्छतः। व्यगच्छत् तदहःशेषं मनसा व्याकुलेन तु॥<br />Thinking thus in his heart and curious to know the reason the Rishi passed the rest of that day in anxiety.</p>
<p id='91'>अथ सा स्त्री तथोवाच भगवन् पश्य वै रवेः। रूपं संध्याभ्रसंरक्तं किमुपस्थाष्यतां तव॥<br />The lady then addressed him, saying O illustrious one, look at the Sun reddened by the evening clouds! What service shall I do to you.</p>
<p id='92'>स उवाच ततस्तां स्त्री स्नानोदकमिहानय। उपासिष्ये ततः सन्ध्यां वाग्यतो नियतेन्द्रिय॥<br />The Rishi addressed her saying 'Fetch water for my ablution! Having bathed, I shall recite my evening prayers, controlling my tongue and the senses.'</p>
