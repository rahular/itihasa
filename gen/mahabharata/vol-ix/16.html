<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 16</h3><h4>The story of Tandip</h4><p id='1'>उपमन्युरुवाच ऋषिरासीत् कृते तात तण्डिरित्येव विश्रुतः। दशवर्षसहस्राणि तेन देव: समाधिना॥ आराधितोऽभूद् भक्तेन तस्योदकं निशामय। स दृष्टवान् महादेवमस्तौषीच्च स्तवैर्विभुम्॥<br />Upamanyu said There was in the golden cycle. O sire, a Rishi named Tandi. With devoted heart he worshipped with the help of Yoga meditation, the great God for ten thousand years. Hear me as I tell you the fruit, or reward he reaped of such wonderful devotion. He succeeded in seeing Mahadeva and lauded him by uttering some hymns.</p>
<p id='2'>इति तण्डिस्तपोयोगात् परमात्मानमव्ययम्। चिन्तयित्वा महात्मानमिदमाह सुविस्मितः॥<br />Thinking, with the help of his penances, of Him who is the supreme Soul and who is eternal and undecaying. Tandi became stricken with wonder and said these words,</p>
<p id='3'>यं पठन्ति सदा सांख्याश्चिन्तयन्ति च योगिनः। परं प्रधानं पुरुषमधिष्ठातारमीश्वरम्॥ उत्पत्तौ च विनाशे च कारणं यं विदुर्बुधाः। देवासुरमुनीनां च परं यस्मान्न विद्यते॥ अजं तमहमीशानमनादिनिधनं प्रभुम्। अत्यन्तसुखिनं देवमनघं शरणं व्रजे॥<br />I scek His refuge whom the Sankhyas describe and the Yogins think of as the greal, the foremost, the Male Being, the pervader of all things, and the Lord of all existent objects, who is the cause of both the creation and the destruction of the universe, who is superior to all the gods, the Asuras, and the Munis, who has nothing higher who is uncreate, who is the Lord of all things. Who has neither beginning nor end, and who is gifted with supreme power, who is possessed of the highest happiness, and who is effulgent and sinless.</p>
<p id='4'>एवं ब्रुवन्नेव तदा ददर्श तपसां निधिम्। तमव्ययमनौपम्यमचिन्त्यं शाश्वतं ध्रुवम्॥ निष्कलं सकलं ब्रह्म निर्गुणं गुणगोचरम्। योगिनां परमानन्दमक्षरं मोक्षसंज्ञितम्॥ मनोरिन्द्राग्निमरुतां विश्वस्य ब्रह्मणो गतिम्। अग्राह्यमचलं शुद्धं बुद्धिग्राह्यं मनोमयम्॥ दुर्विज्ञेयमसंख्येयं दुष्प्रापमकृतात्मभिः। योनि विश्वस्य जगतस्तमसः परतः परम्॥<br />After he had said these words, Tandi, saw before him that ocean of penances, that great God who is eternal and undecaying, who is peerless, who is inconceivable, who is eternal, and who is without any change, who is indivisible, who is whole, who is Brahma, who is above all attributes, and who is gifted with attributes, who is the highest delight of Yogins, who is without decrease, who is called Liberation, who is the refuge of the mind, of Indra, of Agni, of the Wind-God, of the entire universe, and of the Grandfather Brahman; who cannot be comprehended by the mind who is without change of any kind, who is pure, who is capable of being apprehended by the understanding only, and who is immaterial as the mind; who cannot be comprehended, who cannot be measured, who is difficult of being attained, by persons of impure souls, who is the origin of the universe, and who is above both the universe and the quality of darkness; who is ancient, who is Purusha, who is gifted with effulgence, and who is higher than the highest.</p>
<p id='5'>यः प्राणवन्तमात्मानं ज्योतिर्जीवस्थितं मनः। तं देवं दर्शनाकाङ्क्षी बहून् वर्षगणानृषिः॥<br />Desirous of seeing Him who investing himself with vital airs, lives in the individual soul, in the form of that effulgence which is called the Mind, the Rishi Tandin, passed many years practising the severest austerities, and having succeeded in seeing Him as the reward of those penances, he lauded the great God in the following terms.</p>
<p id='6'>तण्डि उवाच तपस्युग्रे स्थितो भूत्वा दृष्ट्वा तुष्टाव चेश्वरम्।। पवित्राणां पवित्रस्त्वं गतिर्गतिमतां वर॥<br />Tandi said You are the purifier of all purifiers and the refuge of all, o foremost of all beings gifted with intelligence! You are the most dreadful energy of all kinds of energy. You are the austerest penance of all penances.</p>
