<h3>ANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 34</h3><h4>-continued The adoration of the Brahmanas</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच ब्राह्मणानेव सततं भृशं सम्परिपूजयेत्। एते हि सोमराजान ईश्वराः सुखदुःखयोः॥<br />Bhishma said One should always offer the most respectful adoration to the Brahmanas. They have Soma for their king, and they it is who confer happiness and misery upon others.</p>
<p id='2'>एते भौगैरलङ्कारैरन्यैश्चैव किमिच्छकैः। सदा पूज्या नमस्कारै रक्ष्याश्च पितृवन्नृपैः॥ ततो राष्ट्रस्य शान्तिर्हि भूतानामिव वासवात्।<br />They, O king, should always be cherished and protected as one cherishes and protect his own father and grandfather, and should be adored with bows and gifts of food and ornaments and other articles of enjoyment as also with such things as they may wish for. The peace and happiness of the kingdom originate from such respect shown to the Brahmanas even as the peace and happiness of all living creatures come from Vasava the king of the gods.</p>
<p id='3'>जायतां ब्रह्मवर्चस्वी राष्ट्रे वै ब्राह्मणः शुचिः॥ महारथश्च राजन्य एष्टव्यः शत्रुतापनः।<br />Let Brahmanas of pure conduct and Brahmaeffulgence be born in a kingdom. Kshatriya also who are splendid carwarriors and that are capable of defeating all enemies, should be desired.</p>
<p id='4'>ब्राह्मणं जातिसम्पन्नं धर्मज्ञं संशितव्रतम्॥ वासयेत गृहे राजन् न तस्मात् परमस्ति वै।<br />This was said to me by Narada. There is nothing higher, O king, than this viz., the act of making a Brahmana of good birth, having a knowledge of morality and righteousness, and steadfast in the observance of excellent vows, live in his mansion. Such an act yields every sort of blessing.</p>
<p id='5'>ब्राह्मणेभ्यो हविर्दत्तं प्रतिगृह्णन्ति देवताः॥ पितरः सर्वभूतानां नैतेभ्यो विद्यते परम्।<br />The sacrificial offerings given Brahmanas reach the very gods who accept them. Brahmanas are the fathers of all creatures. There is nothing higher than a Brahmana.</p>
<p id='6'>आदित्यश्चन्द्रमा वायुरापो भूरम्बरं दिशः॥ सर्वे ब्राह्मणमाविश्य सदानमुपभुञ्जते। न तस्याश्नन्ति पितरो यस्य विप्रा न भुञ्जते॥<br />The Sun, the Moon, the Wind, the Water, the Earth, the Sky and the points of the compass, all enter the body of the Brahmana and take what the Brahmana eats. In that house where Brahmanas do not eat, the departed manes refuse to eat.</p>
<p id='7'>देवाश्चाप्यस्य नाश्नन्ति पापस्य ब्राह्मणद्विषः। ब्राह्मणेषु तु तुष्टेषु प्रीयन्ते पितरः सदा॥<br />The gods also never eat in the house of the wretch who hates the Brahmanas. When the Brahmanas are pleased, the departed manes are also pleased.</p>
<p id='8'>तथैव देवता राजन् नात्र कार्या विचारणा। तथैव तेऽपि प्रीयन्ते येषां भवति तद्धविः॥<br />The deities also become pleased when the Brahmanas are pleased. There is no doubt in this. They who give away the sacrificial Havi to the Brahmanas become themselves pleased.</p>
<p id='9'>न च प्रेत्य विनश्यन्ति गच्छन्ति च परां गतिम्। येन येनैव हविषा ब्राह्मणांस्तर्पयेन्नरः॥ तेन तेनैव प्रीयन्ते पितरो देवतास्तथा। ब्राह्मणादेव तद् भूतं प्रभवन्ति यतः प्रजाः॥<br />Such men never meet with destruction. Indeed, they succeed in acquiring great ends. Those particular offerings in sacrifices with which one pleases the Brahmanas, go to please both the departed manes and the deities. The Brahmana is the cause of that sacrifice whence all created things have originated.</p>
<p id='10'>यतश्चायं प्रभवति प्रेत्य यत्र च गच्छति। वेदेष मार्ग स्वर्गस्य तथैव नरकस्य च॥<br />The Brahmana is acquainted with that from which this universe has originated and to which, when apparently, destroyed it. returns. Indeed, the Brahmana knows the path that leads to the celestial region and the other path which leads to the opposite place.</p>
<p id='11'>आगतानागते चोभे ब्राह्मणो द्विपदां वरः। ब्राह्मणो भरतश्रेष्ठ स्वधर्मं चैव वेद यः॥<br />The Brahmana is conversant with that which has taken place and that which will take place. The Brahmana is the foremost of all twolegged beings. The Brahmana, O chief of the Bharatas, is fully conversant with those duties which have been laid down for his order.</p>
<p id='12'>ये चैनमनुवर्तन्ते ते न यान्ति पराभवम्। न ते प्रेत्य विनश्यन्ति गच्छन्ति न पराभवम्॥<br />Those persons who follow the Brahmanas are never defeated. They never meet with destruction even after death. Indeed, victory is always theirs.</p>
<p id='13'>यद् ब्राह्मणमुखात् प्राप्तं प्रतिगृह्णन्ति वै वचः। भूतात्मानो महात्मानस्ते न यान्ति पराभवम्॥<br />Those great persons indeed, those persons who have subdued their souls, who accept the words that fall from the lips of the Brahmanas, are never defeated. Victory always becomes theirs.</p>
<p id='14'>क्षत्रियाणां प्रतपतां तेजसा च बलेन च। ब्राह्मणेष्वेव शाम्यन्ति तेजांसि च बलानि च।॥<br />The energy of those Kshatriyas who scorch everything with their energy and might, when they encounter the Brahmanas, become neutralised.</p>
<p id='15'>भृगवस्तालजंघाश्च नीपानाङ्गिरसोऽजयन्। भरद्वाजो वैहतव्यानैलांश्च भरतर्षभ॥<br />The Bhrigus conquered the Talajanghas. The sons of Angiras conquered the Nipas. Bharadvaja conquered the Vitahavyas as also the Alias, O chief of Bharata's race. and power</p>
<p id='16'>चित्रा युधांश्चाप्यजयन्नेते कृष्णाजिनध्वजाः। प्रक्षिप्याथ च कुम्भान् वै पारगामिनमारभेत्॥<br />Although all these Kshatriyas were capable of using various arms, yet the Brahmanas named, owning only black deer-skins for their emblems, succeeded in conquering them effectually. Bestowing the Earth upon the Brahmanas and illuminating both the worlds by the brilliance of such an act, one should accomplish acts through which one may succeed in acquiring the end of all things.</p>
<p id='17'>यत् किंचित् कथ्यते लोकेश्रूयते पठ्यतेऽपि वा। सर्वं तद् ब्राह्मणेष्वेव गूढोऽग्निरिव दारुषु॥<br />Like. fire concealed within wood, everything that is said or heard or read in this world, lies in the Brahmana.</p>
<p id='18'>अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। संवादं वासुदेवस्य पृथिव्याश्च भरतर्षभ॥<br />Regarding it is cited the old history of the conversation between Vasudeva and the Earth, O chief of Bharata's race.</p>
<p id='19'>वासुदेव उवाच मातरं सर्वभूतानां पृच्छे त्वां संशयं शुभे। केनस्वित् कर्मणा पापं व्यपोहति नरो गृही॥<br />Vasudeva said O mother, of all creatures, O auspicious goddess, I wish to ask you for a solution of this doubt of mine! By what act does a man living like a householder succeed in cleansing all his sins.?</p>
<p id='20'>पृथ्वी उवाच ब्राह्मणानेव सेवेत पवित्रं ह्येतदुत्तमम्। ब्राह्मणान् सेवमानस्य रजः सर्वं प्रणश्यति। अतो भूतिरतः कीर्तिरतो बुद्धिः प्रजायते॥<br />The Earth said One should serve the Brahmanas. This conduct is purifying and excellent. All the impurities are destroyed of that man who serves the Brahmanas with respect.</p>
<p id='21'>महारथश्च राजन्य एष्टव्यः शत्रुतापनः। इति मां नारदः प्राह सततं सर्वभूतये॥<br />From this (conduct) arises prosperity. From this arises fame. From this originates intelligence or knowledge of the soul. A Kshatriya, by this conduct, becomes a powerful carwarrior and a destroyer of foes and succeeds in winning great fame.</p>
<p id='22'>ब्राह्मणं जातिसम्पन्नं धर्मज्ञं संशितं शुचिम्। अपरेषां परेषां च परेभ्यश्चैव येऽपरे॥<br />Even this is what Narada said to me, viz., that one should always respect a Brahmana that is well born, of rigid vows, and conversant with the scriptures, if one wishes every kind of prosperity.</p>
<p id='23'>ब्राह्मणा यं प्रशंसन्ति स मनुष्यः प्रवर्धते। अथ यो ब्राह्मणान् क्रुष्टः पराभवति सोऽचिरात्॥२५<br />That man really grows in prosperity who is praised by the Brahmanas who are higher than those who are regarded superior to all men high or low.</p>
<p id='24'>यथा महार्णवे क्षिप्त आमलोष्टो विनश्यति। तथा दुश्चरितं सर्वं पराभावाय कल्पते॥<br />That man who speaks ill of the Brahmanas soon meets with discomfiture, even as a clod of unbaked earth, meets with destruction when thrown into the sea.</p>
<p id='25'>पश्य चन्द्रे कृतं लक्ष्म समुद्रो लवणोदकः। तथा भगसहस्रेण महेन्द्रः परिचिह्नितः॥<br />Similarly, all acts that are hurtful to the Brahmanas, to bring about discomfiture and ruin. Look at the dark spots on the Moon and the salt waters of the ocean.</p>
<p id='26'>तेषामेव प्रभावेण सहस्रनयनो ह्यसौ। शतक्रतुः समभवत् पश्य माधव यादृशम्॥<br />The great Indra had at one time been marked all over with a thousand sexmarks. It was through the power of the Brahmanas that those marks were metamorphosed into as many eyes.</p>
<p id='27'>इच्छन् कीर्तिं च भूतिं च लोकांश्च मधुसूदन। ब्राह्मणानुमते तिष्ठेत् पुरुषः शुचिरात्मवान्॥<br />See, O Madhava, how all these things took place. Desiring fame and prosperity and are sure various regions of beatitude in the next world, a person of pure conduct and soul should, O destroyer of Madhu, live in obedience to the dictates of the Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='28'>भीष्म उवाच इत्येतद् वचनं श्रुत्वा मेदिन्या मधुसूदनः। साधु साध्विति कौरव्य मेदिनीं प्रत्यपूजयत्॥<br />Bhishma said Hearing those words of the goddess Earth, the destroyer of Madhu, O you of Kuru's race, said, Excellent, Excellent! and honoured the goddess in due form.</p>
<p id='29'>एतां श्रुत्वोपमां पार्थ प्रयतो ब्राह्मणर्षभान्। सततं पूजयेथास्त्वं ततः श्रेयोऽभिपत्स्यसे॥<br />Having heard this discourse between the goddess Earth and Madhava, do you, O son of Pritha, always, with rapt soul, adore all superior Brahmanas. Doing this, you will surely obtain what is highly beneficial for you.</p>
