<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 12</h3><h4>-continued Whether man or woman gets greater pleasure from an act of union</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच स्त्रीपुंसयोः सम्प्रयोगे स्पर्शः कस्याधिको भवेत्। एतस्मिन् संशये राजन् यथावद् वक्तुमर्हसि॥<br />Yudhishthira said You should, O king, tell me truly which of the two, viz., man or woman, gets the greater pleasure from an act of union with each other. Kindly remove my doubt it.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>भीष्म उवाच अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। भंगास्वनेन शक्रस्य तथा वैरमभूत् पुरा॥<br />Bhishma said To illustrate this question, the old discourse between Bhangasvana and Shakra is cited in this connection.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>पुरा भंगास्वनो नाम राजर्षिरतिधार्मिकः। अपुत्रः पुरुषव्याघ्र पुत्रार्थं यज्ञमाहरत्॥<br />In days of old there lived a king name Bhangasvana. He was very pious and was known as a royal sage. He was, however, childless, O king, and, therefore, made a sacrifice from desire of getting a son.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>अग्निष्टुतं स राजर्षिरिन्द्रद्विष्टं महाबलः। प्रायश्चित्तेषु मर्त्यानां पुत्रकामेषु चेष्यते॥<br />The sacrifice which that powerful king celebrated was Agnishtuta, which on account of the god of fire being alone worshipped in it, is always disliked by Indra. Yet it is the sacrifice that is desired by men when for the object of getting children they seek to purify themselves of their sins.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>इन्द्रो ज्ञात्वा तु तं यज्ञं महाभागः सुरेश्वरः। अन्तरं तस्य राजर्षेरन्विच्छनियतात्मनः॥<br />Learning that the king was desirous of performing the Agnishtuta, the highly blessed king of the gods, viz., Indra, began from that moment to look for the shortcomings of that royal sage to well controlled soul.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>न चैवास्यान्तरं राजन् स ददर्श महात्मनः। कस्यचित्त्वथ कालस्य मृगयां गतवान् नृपः॥<br />Despite, all his careful watch Indra, however, O king, could not find any shortcomings on the part of the great king. Sometimes after, one day, the king went on a hunting expedition.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>इदमन्तरमित्येव शक्रो नृपममोहयत्। एकाश्वेन च राजर्षिर्धान्त इन्द्रेण मोहितः॥<br />Saying to himself, this, indeed, is an opportunity, Indra stupefied th, king. The king went alone on his horse, confounded, because of the king of the gods having stupefied his senses.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>न दिशाऽविन्दत नृपः क्षुत्पिपासादितस्तदा। इतश्चेतश्च वै राजन् श्रमतृष्णान्वितो नृप॥<br />Stricken with hunger and thirst, the king's confusion was so great that he could not see the cardinal points. Indeed, stricken with thirst, he began to rove about.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>सरोऽपश्यत् सुरुचिरं पूर्णं परमवारिणा। सोऽवगाह सरस्तात पाययामास वाजिनम्॥<br />He then saw a lake that was highly beautiful and was full of transparent water. Descending from his horse, and plunging into the lake, he made his animal to drink.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>अथ पीतोदकं सोऽश्वं वृक्षे बद्ध्वा नृपोत्तमः। अवगाह्य ततः स्नातस्तत्र स्त्रीत्वमवाप्तवान्॥<br />Tying his horse then, whose thirst had been satisfied, to a tree, the king plunged into the lake again for doing his ablutions. To his surprise he found that he was metamorphosed by virtue of the waters, into a woman.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>आत्मानं स्त्रीकृतं दृष्ट्वा वीडितो नृपसत्तमः। चिन्तानुगतसर्वात्मा वयाकुलेन्द्रियचेतनः॥<br />Seeing himself thus changed in respect of sex itself, the king became filled with shame. With his senses and mind completely agitated, he began to think thus with his whole heart.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>आरोहिष्ये कथं त्वश्वं कथं यास्यामि वै पुरम्। इष्टेनाग्निष्टुता चापि पुत्राणां शतमौरसम्॥ जातं महाबलानां मे तान् प्रवक्ष्यामि किं त्वहम्। दारेषु चात्मकीयषु पौरजानपदेषु च॥<br />Alas, how shall I ride my horse? How return to my capital? On account of the Agnishtuta sacrifice I have got a hundred sons all gifted with great strength, and all children of my own loins! Alas, thus changed, what shall I say to them? What shall I say to my wives, my relatives and wellwishers, and my subjects of the city and the provinces?</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>मृदुत्वं च तनुत्वं च विक्लवत्वं तथैव च। स्त्रीगुणा ऋषिभिः प्रोक्ता धर्मतत्त्वार्थदर्शिभिः॥<br />Rishis versed in the truths of duty and religion and other matters say that mildness and softness and susceptibility to extreme agitation are the characteristics of women, and that activity, hardness, and energy are the characteristics of men. Alas, my manliness is gone! For why has femininity possessed me? On account of this change of sex, how shall I succeed in riding my horse again?</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>व्यायामे कर्कशत्वं च वीर्यं च पुरुषे गुणाः। पौरुषं विप्रनष्टं वै स्त्रीत्वं कनापि मेऽभवत्॥<br />Having thought thus the king, with great exertion, mounted his horse and returned to his capital, changed though he had been into a woman.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>स्त्रीभावात् पुनरश्वं तं कथमारोढुमुत्सहे। महता त्वथ यत्नेन आरुह्याश्वं नराधिपः॥<br />Seeing that extraordinary change his sons and wives and servants, and his subject of the city and the provinces were extremely amazed.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>पुनरायात् पुरं तात स्त्रीकृतो नृपसत्तमः। पुत्रा दाराश्च भृत्याश्च पौरजानपदाश्च ते॥<br />Then addressing them all, that royal sage, that foremost of orators, said, I had gone out on a hunting expedition, accompanied by a large army. Losing all knowledge of the cardinal points I entered a thick and dreadful forest, moved by the fates.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>किंत्विदं विति विज्ञाय विस्मयं परमं गताः। अथोवाच स राजर्षिः स्त्रीभूतो वदतां वरः॥ मृगयामस्मि निर्याता बलैः परिवृतो दृढम्। उद्भ्रान्तः प्राविशं घोरामटवीं दैवचोदितः।॥<br />In that terrible forest, I became very much thirsty and lost my senses. I then saw a beautiful lake abounding with fowl of all sorts.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>अटव्यां च सुघोरायां तृष्णा” नष्टचेतनः। सरः सुरुचिरप्रख्यमपश्यं पक्षिभिर्वृतम्॥ तत्रावगाढः स्त्रीभूतो दैवेनाहं कृतः पुराः। नामगोत्राणि चाभाष्य दाराणां मन्त्रिणां तथा॥<br />Plunging into that lake for performing my ablutions, I was changed into a woman! Summoning then his wives and counsellors, and all his sons by their names, that best of kings changed into a woman said to them these words: Do you enjoy this kingdom happily. About myself, I shall go to the forest, you sons.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>आह पुत्रांस्ततः सोऽथ स्त्रीभूतः पार्थिवोत्तमः। सम्प्रीत्या भुज्यतां राज्यं वनं यास्यामि पुत्रकाः॥<br />Having said thus to his children, the king went to the forest. Arrived there, she arrived at a hermitage inhabited by an ascetic.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>एवमुक्त्वा पुत्रशतं वनमेव जगाम ह। गत्वा चैवाश्रमं सा तु तापसं प्रत्यपद्यत॥ तापसेनास्य पुत्राणामाश्रमेष्वभवच्छतम्। अथ साऽऽदाय तान् सर्वान् पूर्वपुत्रानभाषत।॥<br />By that ascetic the changed monarch gave birth to a hundred sons. Taking all those children of hers, she went to where her former children were, and addressing the latter, said, You are the children of my loins while I was a man. These are my children given birth to by me in this state of change. Sons, do you all enjoy my kingdom together, like brothers born of the saine parents.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>पुरुषत्वे सुता यूयं स्त्रीत्वे चेमे शतं सुताः। एकत्र भुज्यतां राज्यं भ्रातृभावेन पुत्रकाः॥ सहिता भ्रातरस्तेऽथ राज्यं बुभुजिरे तदा। तान् दृष्ट्वा भ्रातृभावेन भुञ्जानान् राज्यमुत्तमम्॥<br />Thus commanded by their parent, all the brothers, in a body, began to enjoy the kingdom as their joint property. Seeing those children of the king all jointly enjoying the kingdom as brothers born of the same parents, the king of the gods, filled with anger, began to reflect, by transforming this royal sage into a woman, I have, it appears, done him good instead of an injury:</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>चिन्तयामास देवेन्द्रो मन्युनाऽथ परिप्लुतः। उपकारोऽस्य राजर्षेः कृतो नापकृतं मया।॥<br />Saying this, the king of the gods, viz., Indra of a hundred sacrifices, assuming the form of a Brahmana, went to the capital of the king and meeting all the children succeeded in creating dissensions amongst them.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>ततो ब्राह्मणरूपेण देवराजः शतक्रतुः। भेदयामास तान् गत्वा नगरं वै नृपात्मजान्॥<br />He said to them, Brothers never remain at peace even when they are the children of the same father. The sons of the sage Kashyapa, viz., the gods and the Asuras, fell out with each other on account of the sovereignty of the three worlds.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>भ्रातृणां नास्ति सौभ्रात्रं येष्वेकस्य पितुः सुताः। राज्यहेतोर्विवदिताः कश्यपस्य सुरासुराः॥<br />As regards you princes, you are the children of the royal sage Bhangasvana.

The king of the gods, viz., Indra, assuming the form of a Brahmana, came where the ascetic lady was living, and meeting her, said you having a beautiful face, with what grief do you burn so that you are thus bewailing? Seeing the Brahmana, the lady told। him in a piteous tone.</p>
