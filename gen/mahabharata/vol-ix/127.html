<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 127</h3><h4>The worship of sacred fire</h4><p id='1'>विभावसुरुवाच सलिलस्याञ्जलिं पूर्णमक्षताश्च घृतोत्तराः। सोमस्योत्तिष्ठमानस्य तज्जलं चाक्षतांश्च तान्॥ स्थितो ह्यभिमुखो मर्त्यः पौर्णमास्यां बलिं हरेत्। अग्निकार्यं कृतं तेन हुताश्चास्याग्नयस्त्रयः॥<br />Vibhavasu (The Sun) said : There are two offerings. One of these consists of a palmful of water and the other called Akshata consists of rice grains with clarified butter. One should on the day of the full moon, stand facing that bright orb and make to him the two offerings mentioned viz., a palmful of water and the rice grains with clarified butter called Akshata. The man who presents these offerings is said to worship his sacred fire. Indeed, he is considered as one who has poured libations the three (principal) fires.</p>
<p id='2'>वनस्पतिं च यो हन्यादमावास्यामबुद्धिमान्। अपि टेकेन पत्रेण लिप्यते ब्रह्महत्यया।॥<br />That man of little understanding who cuts down a large tree on the day of the new moon, becomes sullied with the sin of Brahmanicide. By killing even a single leaf one commits that sin.</p>
<p id='3'>दन्तकाष्ठं तु यः खादेदमावास्यामबुद्धिमान्। हिंसितश्चन्द्रमास्तेन पितरचोद्विजन्ति च॥<br />That foolish man who chews a toothbrush on the day of the new moon is considered as on injuring the god of the moon by such a deed. The departed Manes of such a person become annoyed with him.</p>
<p id='4'>हव्यं न तस्य देवाश्च प्रतिगृह्णन्ति पर्वसु। कुप्यन्ते पितरश्चास्य कुले वंशोऽस्य हीयते॥<br />The celestials do not accept the libations poured by such a man on days of the full moon and the new moon. His departed Manes, become enraged with him and his family become extinct.</p>
<p id='5'>श्रीरुवाच प्रकीर्णं भाजनं यत्र भिन्नभाण्डमथासनम्। योषितश्चैव हन्यन्ते कश्मलोपहते गृहे॥ देवताः पितरश्चैव उत्सवे पर्वणीषु वा। निराशा:प्रतिगच्छन्ति कश्मलोपहताद् गृहात्॥<br />Shree said The celestials and departed Manes leave that sinful house, in which eating and drinking vessels and seats and beds lie scattered and in which women are beaten. Without accepting the offerings made to them by the owners of such houses, the celestials and the departed Manes fly away from such a sinful house.</p>
<p id='6'>अङ्गिरा उवाच यस्तु संवत्सरं पूर्णं दद्याद् दीपं करञ्जके। सुवर्चलामूलहस्तः प्रजा तस्य विवर्धते॥<br />Angirasa said The offspring of that man multiplies who stands every night for a full year under a Karanjaka tree with a lamp for lighting it and holds in his hands the roots of the Suvarchala plant.</p>
<p id='7'>गार्ग्य उवाच आतिथ्यं सततं कुर्याद् दीपं दद्यात् प्रतिश्रये। वर्जयानो दिवा स्वापं न च मांसानि भक्षयेत्॥<br />Gargya said One should always do the duties of hospitality to his guests. One should give lamps in the hall or shed where sacrifices are celebrated. One should avoid sleep during the day, and abstain from all sorts of flesh or food. never</p>
<p id='8'>गोब्राह्मणं न हिंस्याच्च पुष्कराणि च कीर्तयेत्। एष श्रेष्ठतमो धर्मः सरहस्यो महाफलः॥<br />One should injure kine and Brahmanas. One should always recite the names of the Pushkara lakes and the other sacred waters. Such a course of duty is the foremost. Even this forms a high religion with its mysteries. If observed in practice, it is sure lo yield great results.</p>
<p id='9'>अपि क्रतुशतैरिष्ट्वा क्षयं गच्छति तद्धविः। न तु क्षीयन्ति ते धर्माः श्रद्दधानैः प्रयोजिताः॥<br />If a person celebrated even a hundred sacrifices, he is doomed to see the exhaustion of the merits belonging to the libations poured therein. The duties, however which I have mentioned are 'such that when observed by persons having faith their merit becomes endless.</p>
<p id='10'>इदं च परमं गुह्यं सरहस्यं निबोधत। श्राद्धकल्पे च दैवे च तैर्थिके पर्वणीषु च॥ रजस्वला च या नारी वित्रिकापुत्रिका च या।<br />Listen to another great mystery unknown to many. The celestials do not eat the libations on occasions of Shraddhas and rites in their honour or on occasions of those rites which are performed on ordinary lunar days or on the especially sacred days of the full moon and the new moon, if they see a woman in her menses or one who is the daughter of a mother suffering from leprosy.</p>
<p id='11'>एताभिश्चक्षुषा दृष्टं हविर्नाश्नन्ति देवताः॥ पितरश्च न तुष्यन्ति वर्षाण्यपि त्रयोदश।<br />The ancestors of the man who allows such a woman to come near to place where the Shraddha is being performed by him do not become pleased with him for thirteen years.</p>
<p id='12'>शुक्लवासाः शुचिर्भूत्वाः ब्राह्मणान् स्वस्ति वाचयेत्। कीर्तयेद् भारतं चैव तथा स्यादक्षयं हविः॥<br />Clad in white clothes, and becoming pure in body and mind, one should invite Brahmanas and make them utter their benedictions. On such occasions one should also recite the 110W Bharata. It is by observing all these that the offerings made at Shraddhas become endless.</p>
<p id='13'>धौम्य उवाच भिन्नभाण्डं च खट्वां च कुक्कुटं शुनकं तथा। अप्रशस्तानि सर्वाणि यश्च वृक्षो गृहेरुहः॥<br />Broken utensils broken bedsteads, cocks and dogs as also such trees as have grown within dwelling houses, are all in auspicious objects. Dhaumya said</p>
<p id='14'>भिन्नभाण्डे कलिं प्राहुः खट्वायां तु धनक्षयः। कुक्कुटे शुनके चैव हविर्नाश्नन्ति देवताः। वृक्षमूले ध्रुवं सत्त्वं तस्माद् वृक्षं न रोपयेत्॥<br />In a broken utensil exists Kali himself, while in a broken bedstead is loss of money. When a cock or a dog is seen, the celestials do not eat the offerings made to them. Scorpions and snakes find shelter under the roots of a tree. Hence one should never plant a tree within his house.</p>
<p id='15'>जमदग्निरुवाच यो यजेदश्वमेधेन वाजपेयशतेन ह। अवाशिरा वा लम्बेत सत्रं वा स्फीतमाहरेत्॥ न यस्य हृदयं शुद्धं नरकं स ध्रुवं व्रजेत्। तुल्यं यज्ञश्च सत्यं च हृदयस्य च शुद्धता॥<br />Jamadagni said That man whose heart is not pure is sure to go to Hell even if he worships the celestials in a Horse sacrifice or in hundred Vajapeya Sacrifices, or if he practises the severes austerities with head down most. Purity of heart is considered as equal to Sacrifices and Truth.</p>
<p id='16'>शुद्धेन मनसा दत्त्वा सक्तुप्रस्थं द्विजातये। ब्रह्मलोकमनुप्राप्तः पर्याप्तं तन्निदर्शनम्॥<br />A very barley with a pure heart to a Brahmana, acquired poor Brahmana by giving only a portion of powered the region of Brahman himself. This is a sufficient proof.</p>
