<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 100</h3><h4>The merits of the gifts of light, incense, &c. The discourse between Nahusha and Agastya on the subject</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच कथं वै स विपन्नश्च कथं वै पातितो भुवि। कथं चानिन्द्रतां प्राप्तस्तद् भवान् वक्तुमर्हति॥<br />Yudhishthira said How was Nahusha plunged into distress? How was he hurled down on the Earth? How, indeed, was he deprived of the sovereignty of the celestials? You should recite everything to me.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>भीष्म उवाच एवं तयोः संवदतोः क्रियास्तस्य महात्मनः। सर्वा एव प्रवर्तन्ते या दिव्या याश्च मानुषीः॥<br />Bhishma said Thus did those two Rishis, viz., Bhrigu and Agastya, talk with each other, I have already told you how Nahusha, when he first become the king of the celestials, acted in a proper way. Indeed, that great royal sage performed all human and celestial deeds.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>तथैव दीपदानानि सर्वोपकरणानि वै। बलिकर्म च यच्चान्यदुत्सेकाश्च पृथग्विधाः॥ सर्वे तस्य समुत्पन्ना देवेन्द्रस्य महात्मनः। देवलोके नृलोके च सदाचारा बुधैः स्मृताः॥<br />Nahusha who had become the king of the celestials, made gifts of light, and properly deserved all other rites of a similar nature, the due presentation of Balis, and all rites as are performed on especially sacred days. Pious acts are always done by wise men, in both the world of men and that of the celestials, Indeed, O foremost of kings, if such acts are observed, householders always succeed in acquiring prosperity and aggrandisement.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>ते चेद् भवन्ति राजेन्द्र ऋद्ध्यन्ते गृहमेधिनः। धूपप्रदानैर्दीपैश्च नमस्कारैस्तथैव च॥<br />Even such is the effect of the gift of lamps and of incense, as also of bows and prostrations, to the celestials.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>यथा सिद्धस्य चान्नस्य ग्रहायाग्रं प्रदीयते। बलयश्च गृहोद्देशे अतः प्रीयन्ति देवताः॥<br />When food is cooked, the first portion thereof should be offered to a Brahmana. The particular offerings called Bali should also be presented to the household gods. The deities become pleased with such gifts.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>यथा च गृहिणस्तोषो भवेद् वै बलिकर्मणि। तथा शनगुणा प्रीतिर्देवतानां प्रजायते॥<br />It is also well known that the measure of gratification which the celestials derive from such offerings is a hundred times as great as that which the householder himself gets from making them.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>एवं धूपप्रदानं च दीपदानं च साधवः। प्रयच्छन्ति नमस्कारैर्युक्तमात्मगुणावहम्॥<br />Pious and wise persons make offering of incense and lights, accompanying them with bows and prostrations. Such acts always yield advancement and prosperity to those that do them.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>स्नानेनादिश्च यत् कर्म क्रियते वै विपश्चिता। नमस्कारप्रयुक्तेन तेन प्रीयन्ति देवताः॥<br />Those rites which the learned perform in course of their ablutions, and with the help of waters, accompanied with bows to the gods, always contribute to the satisfaction of the celestials.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>पितरश्च महाभागा ऋषयश्च तपोधनाः। गृह्याश्च देवताः सर्वाः प्रीयन्ते विधिनार्चिताः॥<br />When adored with proper rites, the highlyblessed departed Manes, Rishis having asceticism for wealth, and the household deities, all become pleased.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>इत्येतां बुद्धिमास्थाय नहुषः स नरेश्वरः। सुरेन्द्रत्वं महत् प्राप्य कृतवानेतदद्भुतम्॥<br />Filled with such ideas, Nahusha, that great king, when he obtained the sovereignty of the celestials, observed all these rites and duties fraught with great glory.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>कस्यचित् त्वथ कालस्य भाग्यक्षय उपस्थिते। सर्वमेतदवज्ञाय कृतवानिदमीदृशम्॥<br />Sometime after, the good fortune of Nahusha decreased, and as the outcome of it, he neglected all these observances and began to act in defiance of all control in the manner I have already described.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>ततः स परिहीणोऽभूत् सुरेन्द्रो बलदर्पतः। धूपदीपोदक विधिं न यथावच्चकार ह॥<br />The king of the celestials, on account of his abstention from observing the ordinances about the offers of incense and light, began to decline in power.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>ततोऽस्य यज्ञविषयो रक्षोभिः पर्यबध्यत। अथागस्त्यमृषिश्रेष्ठं वाहनायाजुहाव ह॥<br />His sacrificial rites and presents were obstructed by Rakshasas. It was at this time that Nahusha yoked that foremost of Rishis, viz., Agastya, to his car.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>द्रुतं सरस्वतीकूलात् स्मयन्निव महाबलः। ततो भृगुर्महातेजा मैत्रावरुणिमब्रवीत्॥<br />Possessed of great strength Nahusha smiling all the while, set that great Rishi speedily to the task, commanding him to bear the vehicle from the banks of the Sarasvati. At this time, Bhrigu, possessed of great energy, addressed the son of Mitravaruna, saying:</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>निमीलय स्वनयने जटां यावद् विशामि ते। स्थाणुभूतस्य तस्थाय जटां प्राविशदच्युतः॥ भृगुः स सुमहातेजाः पातनाय नृपस्य च। ततः स देवराट प्राप्तस्तमृर्षि वाहनाय वै॥<br />Do you shut your eyes till I enter into the matted locks on your head. Having said this, Bhrigu of unfading glory and great energy entered into the matted locks of Agastya who stood still like a wooden post, for hurling king Nahusha from the throne of Heaven. Soon after Nahusha saw Agastya approach him for bearing his car.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>ततोऽगस्त्यः सुरपतिं वाक्यमाह विशाम्पते। योजयस्वेति मां क्षिप्रं कं च देशं वहामि ते॥<br />Seeing the king of the celestials, Agastya addressed him, saying, Do you yoke me to your vehicle forthwith! To what region shall I bear you.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>यत्र वक्ष्यसि तत्र त्वां नयिष्यामि सुराधिप। इत्युक्तो नहुषस्तेन योजयामास तं मुनिम्॥<br />O lord of the celestials, I shall bear you to the spot which you may be pleased to direct! Thus addressed by him. Nahusha caused the ascetic to be yoked to his car.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>भृगुस्तस्य जटान्तस्थो बभूव हृषितो भृशम्। न चापि दर्शनं तस्य चकार स भृगुस्तदा।॥<br />Bhrigu, who was living within the matted locks of Agastya, became highly pleased at this act of Nahusha. He took care not to look at Nahusha.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>वरदानप्रभावज्ञो नहुषस्य महात्मनः। न चुकोप तदाऽगस्त्यो युक्तोऽपि नहुषेण वै॥<br />Fully acquainted with the power which the illustrious Nahusha had acquired on account of the boon which Brahman had granted him, Bhrigu acted thus. Agastya also though treated by Nahusha in this way, did not yield to anger.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>तं तु राजा प्रतोदेन चोदयामास भारत। न चुकोप स धर्मात्मा ततः पादेन देवराट्॥ अगस्त्यस्य तदा क्रुद्धो वामेनाभ्यहनच्छिरः। तस्मिन्शिरस्यभिहते स जटान्तर्गतो भृगुः॥ शशाप बलवत्क्रुद्धो नहुषं पापचेतसम्। यस्मात् पदाऽऽहतः कोधाच्छिरसीमं महामुनिम्॥ तस्मादाशु महीं गच्छ सर्पो भूत्वा सुदुर्मते। इत्युक्तः स तदा तेन सर्पो भूत्वा पपात ह॥ अदृष्टेनाथ भृगुणा भूतले भरतर्षभ। भृगुं हि यदि सोऽद्रक्ष्यन्नहुषः पृथिवीपते॥ न च शक्तोऽभविष्यद् वै पातने तस्य तेजसा। स तु तैस्तैः प्रदानैश्च तपोभिर्नियमैस्तथा॥ पतितोऽपि महाराज भूतले स्मृतिमानभूत्। प्रसादयामास भृगु शापान्तो मे भवेदिति॥<br />Then, O Bharata, king Nahusha urged Agastya on with his goad. The pious Rishi did not still yield to anger. The lord of the celestials, himself enraged, then struck Agastya on the head with his left foot. When the Rishi was thus struck on the head, Bhrigu, who was living within Agastya's matted locks became incensed and cursed the sinful Nahusha, saying, Since you have struck with your foot on the head of this great Rishi, do you, therefore, fall down on the Earth, changed into a snake, O wretch of wicked understanding! Thus, imprecated by Bhrigu who had not been seen Nahusha, forthwith became transformed into a snake and dropped down on the Earth, O chief of Bharata's race! If, O monarch, Nahusha had seçn Bhrigu, the latter would not then have succeeded, by his power, in hurling the forner down on the Earth. On account of the various gifts that Nahusha had made, as also his penances and religious observances, though hurled down on the Earth. O king, he succeeded in keeping his memory. He then began to propitiate Bhrigu with a view to get rid of the curse.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>ततोऽगस्त्यः कृपाविष्टः प्रसादयत तं भृगुम्। शापान्तार्थं महाराज स च प्रादात् कृपान्वितः॥<br />Agastya also, filled with mercy joined Nahusha in pacifying Bhrigu for the termination of the curse. At last Bhrigu felt mercy for Nahusha and arranged for the working out of the curse.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>भृगु उवाच राजा युधिष्ठिरो नाम भविष्यति कुलोद्वहः। स त्वां मोक्षयिता शापादित्युक्त्वान्तरधीयत॥<br />Bhrigu said There will appear a king (on Earth) of the name of Yudhishthira, the foremost of his race. He will rescue you from this curse! Having said this, the Rishi disappeared from the presence of Nahusha.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>अगस्त्योऽपि महातेजाः कृत्वा कार्यं शतक्रतोः। स्वमाश्रमपदं प्रायात् पूज्यमानो द्विजातिभिः॥<br />Agastya also, of great energy, having thus performed the business of the true Indra, that arbitrator of a hundred sacrifices, returned to his hermitage, adored of all members of the regenerate order.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>नहुषोऽपि त्वया राजंस्तस्माच्छापात् समुद्धृतः। जगाम ब्रह्मभवनं पश्यतस्ते जनाधिप॥<br />You have, o king rescued Nahusha from Bhrigu's curse. Rescued by you, he ascended to the region of Brahman before your eyes.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>तदा स पातयित्वा तं नहुषं भूतले भृगुः। जगाम ब्रह्मभवनं ब्रह्मणे च न्यवेदयत्॥<br />As regards, Bhrigu, having hurled Nahusha on the Earth, he went to the region of Brahman and informed the Grandfather of it.</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>ततः शक्रं समानाय्य देवानाह पितामहः। वरदानान्मम सुरा नहुषो राज्यमाप्तवान्॥<br />The Grandfather having called Indra back, addressed the celestials, saying, You celestials, through the boon I had granted him, Nahusha had obtained the sovereignty of Heaven.</p>
<p id='27'><a href='#27'></a>स चागस्त्येन क्रुद्धेन भ्रंशितो भूतलं गतः। न च शक्यं विना राज्ञा सुरा वर्तयितुं क्वचित्॥<br />Deprived, however, of that sovereignty by the enraged Agastya, he has been hurled on the Earth, O celestials, you will not succeed in living without a king.</p>
<p id='28'><a href='#28'></a>तस्मादयं पुनः शक्रो देवराज्येऽभिषिच्यताम् एवं सम्भाषमाणं तु देवाः पार्थ पितामहम्॥ एवमस्त्विति संदृष्टाः प्रत्यूचुस्तं नराधिप। सोऽभिषिक्तो भगवता देवराज्ये च वासवः॥ ब्रह्मणा राजशार्दूल यथापूर्वं व्यरोचत। एवमेतत् पुरावृत्तं नहुषस्य व्यतिक्रमात्॥<br />Do you, therefore, once more install Indra as the king of Heaven. The celestials filled with joy, O son of Pritha, replied to the Grandsire, who said so to them, saying, So be it. Brahman then, O best of kings, installed Indra in the sovereignty of Heaven. Made once more the king of the celestials, Vasava began to shine in beauty and resplendence. This is what took place forinerly through the transgressions of Nahusha.</p>
<p id='29'><a href='#29'></a>स च तैरेव संसिद्धो नहुषः कर्मभिः पुनः। तस्माद् दीपाः प्रदातव्याःसायं वै गृहमोधिभिः॥<br />On account, however, of the merits he had acquired through deeds of the kind I have mentioned, Nahusha succeeded in once more regaining his lost position. Hence, when evening comes, householders should give lights.</p>
<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>दिव्यं चक्षुरवाप्नोति प्रेत्य दीपस्य दायकः। पूर्णचन्द्रप्रतीकाशा दीपदाश्च भवन्त्युत॥<br />The giver of lights is sure to win celestial vision after death. Givers of light become as resplendent as the full moon.</p>
<p id='31'><a href='#31'></a>यावदक्षिनिमेषाणि ज्वलन्ते तावती: समाः। रूपवान् बलवांश्चापि नरो भवति दीपदः॥<br />The giver of lights becomes gifted with beauty of form and strength for years corresponding with the number of twinkles for which the lights given by him burn or blaze.</p>
