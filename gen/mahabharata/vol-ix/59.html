<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 59</h3><h4>A description of the gifts which fellows the giver to the next world</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच यानीमानि बहिर्वेद्यां दानानि परिचक्षते। तेभ्यो विशिष्टं किं दानं मतं ते कुरुपुङ्गव॥<br />Yudhishthira said Amongst all those gifts mentioned in the work other than the Vedas, which gift, О chief of Kuru's race, is the most superior in your opinion?</p>
<p id='2'>कौतूहलं हि परमं तत्र मे विद्यते प्रभो। दातारं दत्तमन्वेति यद् दानं तत् प्रचक्ष्व मे॥<br />O powerful one, great is my curiosity in this matter. Do you describe to me that gift which follows the giver to the next world?</p>
<p id='3'>भीष्म उवाच अभयं सर्वभूतेभ्यो व्यसने चाप्यनुग्रहः। यच्चाभिलषितं दद्यात् तृषितायाभिचायते॥ दत्तं मन्येत यद् दत्त्वा तद् दानं श्रेष्ठमुच्यते। दत्तं दातारमन्वेति यद् दानं भरतर्षभ॥<br />Bhishma said An assurance to all creatures of love and affection and abstention from every sort of injury, acts of kindness and favour done to a person in distress, gifts, of articles made to one who solicits with thirst and agreeable to the solicitor's wishes, and whatever gifts are made without the giver's ever thinking of them as gifts made by him, form, O chief of Bharata's race, the highest and best of gifts.</p>
<p id='4'>हिरण्यदानं गोदानं पृथिवीदानमेव च। एतानि वै पवित्राणि तारयन्त्यपि दुष्कृतम्॥<br />Gift of gold, gift of kine, and gift of earth,-these are considered as sincleansing. They rescue the giver from his evil deeds.</p>
<p id='5'>एतानि पुरुषव्याघ्र साधुभ्यो देहि नित्यदा। दानानि हि नरं पापान्मोक्षयन्ति न संशयः॥<br />O king, do you always make such gifts, to the righteous. Forsooth, gifts rescue the giver from all his sins.</p>
<p id='6'>यद् यदिष्टतमं लोके यच्चास्य दयितं गृहे। तत् तद् गुणवते देयं तदेवाक्षयमिच्छता॥<br />That person who wishes to make his gifts eternal, should always give to persons gifted with necessary qualifications whatever articles are desired by all and whatever things are the best in his house.</p>
<p id='7'>प्रियाणि लभते नित्यं प्रियदः प्रियकृत् तथा। प्रियो भवति भूतानामिह चैव परत्र च॥<br />The man who makes gifts of agreeable things and who does to others what is agreeable to others, always succeeds in getting things that are agreeable to himself. Such a person certainly becomes agreeable to all, both here and hereafter.</p>
<p id='8'>याचमानमभीमानादनासक्तमकिंचनम्। यो नार्चति यथाशक्ति स नृशंसो युधिष्ठिर॥<br />That man, O Yudhishthira, is a cruel wight, who, through vanity, does not, to the extent of his means, attend to the wishes of the poor and helpless who solicit assistance.</p>
<p id='9'>अमित्रमपि चेद् दीनं शरणैषिणमागतम्। व्यसने योऽनुगृह्णाति स वै पुरुषसत्तमः॥<br />He is, indeed, the foremost of men who shows favour to even an helpless enemy fallen into distress when such enemy comes and prays for help.</p>
<p id='10'>कृशाय कृतविद्याय वृत्तिक्षीणाय सीदते। अपहन्यात् क्षुधां यस्तु न तेन पुरुषः समः॥<br />No man is equal to him who satisfies the hunger of a person who is emaciated, possessed of learning, destitute of the means of support, and weakened by misery.</p>
<p id='11'>क्रियानियमितान् साधून् पुत्रदारैश्च कर्शितान्। अयाचमानान् कौन्तेय सर्वोपायैर्निमन्त्रयेत्॥<br />One should always, O son of Kunti, remove by ever ineans in his power, the distress of the pious observant of vows and acts, who though having no sons and wives and plunged into misery, do not yet solicit others for any kind of help.</p>
<p id='12'>आशिषं ये न देवेषु न च मत्र्येषु कुर्वते। अर्हन्तो नित्यसंतुष्टास्तथा लब्धोपजीविनः॥ आशीविषसमेभ्यश्च तेभ्यो रक्षस्व भारत। तान् युक्तरुपजिज्ञास्यस्तथा द्विजवरोत्तमान्॥<br />Those persons who do not utter blessings upon the deities and men, who are worthy of respect and always contented, and who live upon such alms as they get without begging, are considered as veritable snakes of virulent poison. Do you, O Bharata, always protect yourself from them by making gifts to them. They are capable to make the foremost of Ritwijas. You are to find them out by means of your spies and agents.</p>
<p id='13'>कृतैरावसथैर्नित्यं सप्रेष्यैः सपरिच्छदैः। निमन्त्रयेथाः कौरव्य सर्वकामसुखावहैः॥<br />You should honour those men by gifts of good houses furnished with every necessary article, with slaves and servants, with good dresses and vestments, O son of Kuru, and with all articles bringing on pleasure, and happiness.</p>
<p id='14'>यदि ते प्रतिगृह्णीयुः श्रद्धापूतं युधिष्ठिर। कार्यमित्येव मन्वाना धार्मिकाः पुण्यकर्मिणः॥<br />Righteous men of righteous deeds should make such gifts, moved by the desire that it is their duty to act in that way and not from desire of reaping any regards therefrom. Indeed, good men should act in this way so that the virtuous described above might not, O Yudhishthira, feel any disinclination to accept those gifts sanctified by devotion and faith.</p>
<p id='15'>विद्यास्नाता व्रतस्नाता ये व्यपाश्रित्य जीविनः। गूढस्वाध्यायतपसो ब्राह्मणाः संशितव्रताः॥<br />There are persons bathed in learning and bathed in vows. Without depending upon anybody they get their means of living. These Brahmanas of rigid vows are given to Vedic study and penances without proclaiming their practices to any one. men</p>
<p id='16'>तेषु शुद्धेषु दान्तेषु स्वदारपरितोषिषु। यत् करिष्यसि कल्याणं तत् ते लोके युधाम्पते॥<br />Whatever gifts you may make to those persons of pure conduct, of thorough mastery over their senses, and always contented with their own married wives, are sure to acquire for you a merit that will accompany you in all the worlds into which you may go.</p>
<p id='17'>यथाग्निहोत्रं सुहुतं सायं प्रातर्द्विजातिना। तथा दत्तं द्विजातिभ्यो भवत्यथ यतात्मसु।॥<br />One reaps the same merit by making gifts to twiceborn persons of controlled souls which one acquires by properly pouring libations to the sacred fire morning and evening.</p>
<p id='18'>एष ते विततो यज्ञः श्रद्धापूतः सदक्षिणः। विशिष्टः सर्वयज्ञेभ्यो ददतस्तात वर्तताम्॥<br />This is the sanctified spread out for you, a sacrifice that is sanctified by devotion and faith and that is accompanied with Dakshina! It is superior to all other sacrifices. Let that sacrifice ceaselessly flow from you as you give away.</p>
<p id='19'>निवापदानसलिलस्तादृशेषु युधिष्ठिर। निवसन् पूजयंश्चैव तेष्वानृण्यं नियच्छिति॥<br />Performed in view of such men, O Yudhishthira, a sacrifice in which the water that is sprinkled for dedicating gifts forms the oblations in honour of the Departed Manes, and devotion and worship rendered to such superior men, serves to free one of the debts he owes to the deities.</p>
<p id='20'>य एवं नैव कुप्यन्ते न लुभ्यन्ति तृणेष्वपि। त एव नः पूज्यतमा ये चापि प्रियवादिनः॥<br />Those persons who do not give way to anger and who never desire to take even a blade of grass belonging to others, as also they who are of sweet speech, deserve to receive from us the most respectful adorations.</p>
<p id='21'>एते न बहु मन्यन्ते न प्रवर्तन्ति चापरे। पुत्रवत् परिपाल्यास्ते नमस्तेभ्यस्तथाभयम्॥<br />Such persons and others never pay their regards to the giver. Nor do they try for obtaining gifts. They should, however, be maintained by givers as they maintain their own sons. I bend my head to them. From them also proceeds fearlessness.</p>
<p id='22'>ऋत्विक्पुरोहिताचार्या मृदुब्रह्मधरा हि ते। क्षात्रेणापि हि संसृष्टं तेजः शाम्यति वै द्विजे॥<br />Ritwijas, Priests and Preceptors, when well-read in the Vedas and when behaving mildly towards disciples, become such. Forsooth, Kshatriya energy loses its force upon a Brahmana when it meets him.</p>
<p id='23'>अस्ति मे बलवानस्मि राजास्मीति युधिष्ठिर। ब्राह्मणान् मा च पर्यश्रीर्वासोभिरशनेन च॥<br />Thinking that you are a king, that you are gifted with great power, and that you have riches do, not, O Yudhishthira, enjoy your affluence without giving anything to the Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='24'>यच्छोभार्थं बलार्थं वा वित्तमस्ति तवानघ। तेन ते ब्राह्मणाः पूज्याः स्वधर्ममनुतिष्ठता॥<br />Observing the duties of your own caste, do you adore the Brahmanas with whatever riches you have, O sinless one, for purposes of adornment or sustaining your power.</p>
<p id='25'>नमस्कार्यास्तथा विप्रा वर्तमाना यथातथम्। यथासुखं यथोत्साह ललन्तु त्वयि पुत्रवत्॥<br />Let the Brahmanas live in whatever way they like. You should always bend your head to them with respect. Let them always rejoice in you as your children, living happily and according to their wishes.</p>
<p id='26'>को ह्यक्षयप्रसादानां सुहृदामल्पतोषिणाम्। वृत्तिमहत्यवक्षेप्तुं त्वदन्यः कुरुसत्तम॥<br />Who else save you, O best of the Kurus, can provide the means of livelihood for such Brahmana gifted with eternal contentment, as are your wellwishers, and as are pleased with only a little?</p>
<p id='27'>यथा पत्याश्रयो धर्मः स्त्रीणां लोके सनातनः। सदैव सा गतिर्नान्या तथास्माकं द्विजातयः॥<br />As women have one eternal duty, in this world, viz., dependence upon, and the obedient service of their husbands, and as such duty as are forms their only end, so is the service of Brahmanas our eternal duty and end.</p>
<p id='28'>यदि नो ब्राह्मणास्तात संत्यजेयुरपूजिताः। पश्यन्तो दारुणं कर्म सततं क्षत्रिये स्थितम्॥ अवेदानामयज्ञानामलोकानामवर्तिनाम्। कस्तेषां जीवितेनार्थस्त्वां विना ब्राह्मणाश्रयम्॥<br />If on seeing cruelties and other sinful deeds in Kshatriyas, the Brahmanas, O son, unhonoured by us leave us all, I say, of what use would life be to us, in the absence of all contact with the Brahmanas, especially as we shall then have to carry on our existence without being able to study the Vedas, to celebrate sacrifices, to hope for worlds of bliss hereafter, and to perform great deeds?</p>
<p id='29'>अत्र ते वर्तयिष्यामि यथा धर्मं सनातनम्। राजन्यो ब्राह्मणान् राजन् पुरा परिचचार ह॥<br />I shall, about it, tell you what the eternal practice is. Formerly, O king, the Kshatriyas used to serve the Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='30'>वैश्यो राजन्यमित्येव शूद्रो वैशमति श्रुतिः। दूराच्छूद्रेणोपचर्यो ब्राह्मणोऽग्निरिव ज्वलन्॥<br />The Vaishya likewise used in those days to adore the Kshatriya, and the Shudra to adore the Vaishya. This is what is heard. The Brahmana was like a burning fire. Without being able to touch him or approach his presence, the Shudra used to serve the Brahmana from a distance.</p>
<p id='31'>संस्पर्शपरिचर्यस्तु वैश्येन क्षत्रियेण च। मृदुभावान् सत्यशीलान् सत्यधर्मानुपालकान्॥<br />It was only the Kshatriya and the Vaishya who could serve the Brahmana hy touching his bcdy or approaching his presence. The Brahmanas are gifted with a mild disposition. They are truthful in conduct. They are followers of the true religion.</p>
<p id='32'>आशीविषानिव क्रुद्धास्तानुपाचरत द्विजान्। अपरेषां परेषां च परेभ्यश्चापि ये परे॥<br />When angry, they are like snakes of drcadful poison. Such being their nature, do you, O Yudhishthira, serve and attend them with obedience and respect. The Brahmanas are superior to those who are higher than the high and the low.</p>
<p id='33'>क्षत्रियाणां प्रतपतां तेजसा च बलेन च। ब्राह्मणेष्वेव शाम्यन्ति तेजांसि च तपांसि च॥<br />The energy and penances of those Kshatriyas who blaze forth with energy and power, become powerless and neutralised when they come in in contact with the Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='34'>न मे पिता प्रियतरो न त्वं तात तथा प्रियः। न मे पितुः पिता राजन् न चात्मा न च जीवितम्।।<br />My father himself is not dearer to me than the Brahmanas. My mother is not dearer to me than they. My grandfather, O king, is not dcarer, my own life is not dearer, O king, to me than the Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='35'>त्वत्तश्च मे प्रियतरः पृथिव्यां नास्ति कश्चन। त्वत्तोऽपि मे प्रियतरा ब्राह्मणा भरतर्षभ॥<br />On Earth there is nothing, O Yudhishthira, that is dearer to me than you. But, O chief of Bharata's race, the Brahmanas are dearer to me than even you.</p>
<p id='36'>ब्रवीमि सत्यमेतच्च यथाहं पाण्डुनन्दन। तेन सत्येन गच्छेयं लोकान् यत्र च शान्तनुः॥<br />I tell you truly, O son of Pandu! I swear by this truth, by which I hope to acquire all those blissful regions that have been Shantanu's.</p>
<p id='37'>पश्येयं च सतां लोकाञ्छुचीन् ब्रह्मपुरस्कृतान्। तत्र मे तात गन्तव्यमह्नाय च चिराय च॥<br />I see those sacred regions with Brahma shining conspicuously before them. I shall go there, O son, and live in them eternally.</p>
<p id='38'>सोऽहमतादृशाल्लोकान् दृष्ट्वा भरतसत्तम। यन्मे कृतं ब्राह्मणेषु न तप्ये तेन पार्थिव॥<br />Seeing these regions. O best of the Bharatas. I am filled with joy at the thought of all these acts which I have done in aid and honour of the Brahmanas, O king.</p>
