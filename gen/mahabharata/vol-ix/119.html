The discourse between Dvaipayana and a worm</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच क्षत्रधर्ममनुप्राप्तः स्मरन्नेव च वीर्यवान्। त्यक्त्वा स कीटतां राजंश्चचार विपुलं तपः॥<br />Bhishma said Having renounced the status of a worm and taken birth as a Kshatriya of great energy, the person remembering his previous changes, O monarch began to practise severe austerities.</p>
<p id='2'>तस्य धर्मार्थविदुषो दृष्ट्वा तद् विपुलं तपः। आजगाम द्विजश्रेष्ठः कृष्णद्वैपायनस्तदा॥<br />Seeing those severe austerities of the Kshatriya who was well conversant with religion and Profit, Krishna Dvaipayana, that foremost of Brahmanas, went to him.</p>
<p id='3'>व्यास उवाच क्षानं देवव्रतं कीट भूतानां परिपालनम्। क्षात्रं देवव्रतं व्यायंस्ततो विप्रत्वमेष्यसि॥<br />Vyasa said The penances, O worm, of the Kshatriyas consist of the protection of all creatures. Consider these duties of the Kshatriya to be the penances laid down for you. You shall come by the status of a Brahmana.</p>
<p id='4'>पाहि सर्वाः प्रजाः सम्यक् शुभाशुभविदात्मवान्। शुभैः संविभजन् कामैरशुभानां च पावनैः॥<br />Ascertaining what is right and what is wrong, and purifying your soul, do you duly cherish and protect all creatures, judiciously satisfying all good desires and correcting all that is unholy.</p>

<p id='6'>भीष्म उवाच सोऽप्यवरण्यमनुप्राप्य पुनरेव युधिष्ठिर। महर्षेर्वचनं श्रुत्वा प्रजा धर्मेण पाल्य च॥<br />Bhishma said Although he had retired into the forest yet, O Yudhishthira, having heard the words of the great Rishi, he began to cherish and protect his subjects righteously.</p>
<p id='7'>अचिरेणैव कालेन कीट: पार्थिवसत्तम। प्रजापालनधर्मेण प्रेत्य विप्रत्वमागतः॥<br />Soon O best of kings, that worm, on account of the duty of protecting his subjects became a Brahmana after renouncing his Kshatriya body.</p>
<p id='8'>ततस्तं ब्राह्मणं दृष्ट्वा पुनरेव महायशाः। आजगाम महाप्राज्ञः कृष्णद्वैपायनस्तदा॥<br />Secing him changed into a Brahmana, the celebrated Rishi,viz.,. Krishna Dvaipayana of great wisdom came to him.</p>
<p id='9'>व्यास उवाच भो भो ब्रह्मर्षभ श्रीमन् मा व्यथिष्ठाः कथंचन। शुभकृच्छुभयोनीषु पापकृत् पापयोनिषु॥ उपपद्यति धर्मज्ञ यथापापफलोपगम्।<br />Vyasa said ochief of Brahmanas, O blessed one, be not troubled. He who acts piously, comes by a respectable birth. He on the other hand, who acts impiously comes by a low and vile birth. O you who are conversant with virtue, one attains to misery according to the measure of his sin.</p>
<p id='10'>तस्मान्मृत्युभयात् कीट मा व्यथिष्ठाः कथंचन।॥ धर्मलोपभयं ते स्यात् तस्माद् धर्मं चरोत्तमम्।<br />Therefore, O worm do not be troubled through fear of death. The only fear you should entertain is about the loss of virtue. Do you therefore, go on practising virtue.</p>
<p id='11'>कीट उवाच सुखात् सुखतरं प्राप्तो भगवंस्त्वत्कृते ह्यहम्॥ धर्ममूलां श्रियं प्राप्य पाप्मा नष्ट इहाद्य मे।<br />The Worm said Through your favour, O Holy one, I have attained from happy to happier positions! Having obtained such prosperity as is established in virtue, I think my demerits have been lost.</p>
<p id='12'>भीष्म उवाच भगवद्वचनात् कीटो ब्राह्मण्यं प्राप्य दुर्लभम्॥ अकरोत् पृथिवीं राजन् यज्ञयूपशताङ्किताम्।<br />Bhishma said The worin having at the command of the holy Rishi acquired the status of a Brahmana that is so difficult to attain, caused the Earth to be marked with a thousand sacrificial stakes.</p>
<p id='13'>ततः सालोक्यमगमद ब्रह्मणो ब्रह्मवित्तमः॥ अवाप च पदं कीटः पार्थ ब्रह्म सनातनम्। स्वकर्मफलनिर्वृत्तं व्यासस्य वचनात् तदा॥<br />That foremost of all persons conversant with Brahma then gained a residence in the region of Brahman himself. Indeed, O son of Pritha, the worm acquired the highest status viz. that of eternal Brahma as the result of his own deeds done according to the counsels of Vyasa.</p>
<p id='14'>तेऽपि यस्मात् प्रभावेण हताः क्षत्रियपुङ्गवाः। सम्प्राप्तास्ते गतिं पुण्यां तस्मान्मा शोच पुत्रक॥<br />Those foremost of Kshatriyas, also, who have renounced their lifebreaths, exerting their energy all the while have all acquired a meritorious end. Therefore, O king, do not mourn on their account.</p>
