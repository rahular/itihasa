<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>स तां वृष्णयन्धकजलां हयमीनां रथोडुपाम्। वादित्ररथघोषौघां वेश्मतीर्थमहाह्रदाम्॥ रत्नशैवलसंघातां वज्रप्राकारमालिनीम्। रथ्यास्रोतोजलावर्तो चत्वरस्तिमिनहदाम्॥ रामकृष्णमहाग्राहां द्वारकां सहितं तदा। कालपाशग्रहां भीमा नदी वैतरणीमिव॥<br />The Dwraka-river had the Vrishnis and the Andhakas for its water, horses for its fishes, cars for its rafts, the sound of musical instruments and the rattle of cars for its wayes, houses and mansions and public squares for its lakes. Games and precious stones were its moss. The walls of adamant were the garlands of flowers that floated on it. The streets and roads were the strong currents running in eddies along its surface. The great open squares were the large lakes in its course. Rama and Krishna were its two mighty alligators. That agreeable river now seemed to Arjuna to be the dreadful Vaitarani bound up with Time's net.</p>
