Do you, O grandfather, describe this to me.!</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच सर्वज्ञां सर्वतत्त्वज्ञां देवलोके मनस्विनीम्। कैकेयी सुमना नाम शाण्डिली पर्यपृच्छत॥ केन वृत्तेन कल्याणि समाचारेण केन वा। विधूय सर्वपापानि देवलोकं त्वमागता॥ हुताशनशिखेव त्वं ज्वलमाना स्वतेजसा। सुता ताराधिपस्येव प्रभया दिवमागता॥<br />Bhishma said Once on a time in the celestial region, a lady named Sumana of Kaikeya's race, addressing Shandili, gifted with great energy and conversant with the truth regarding everything and gifted with omniscience, said, By what conduct, O auspicious lady, by what course of deeds have you succeeded in acquiring the celestial region, purged off of every sin? You shine with your own energy like a flame of fire, You appear to be a daughter of the Lord of stars, come to Heaven in your own effulgence.</p>
<p id='3'>अरजांसि च वस्त्राणि धारयन्ती गलक्लमा। विमानस्था शुभा भासि सहस्रगुणमोजसा॥<br />You put on dresses of pure white, and as quite cheerful and at your case. Scated on that celestial car, you shine, O auspicious dame, with energy multiplied a thousand fold.</p>

<p id='5'>इति पृष्टा सुमनया मधुरं चारुहासिनी। शाण्डिली निभृतं वाक्यं सुमनामिदमब्रवीत्॥ नाहं कापायवसना नापि वल्कलधारिणी। च जटिला भूत्वा देवत्वमागता॥ अहितानि च वाक्यानि सर्वाणि परुषाणि च। अप्रमत्ता च भर्तारं कदाचिन्नाहमब्रुवम॥<br />Thus questioned swectly by Sumana, Stiandili of sweet smiles, addressing her fair interrogatrix, thus answered her silently. I did not wear yellow robes; nor barks of trees. I did not shave my head; nor did I keep matted locks on my head. It is not on account of these deeds that I have acquired the status of a celestial. I never carelessly addressed any harsh words to my husband.</p>
<p id='6'>न च मुण्डा देवतानां पितॄणां च ब्राह्मणानां च पूजने। अप्रमत्ता सदा युक्ता श्वश्वशुरवर्तिनी॥<br />I was always devoted to the adoration of the celestials the departed Manes, and the Brahmanas. Always careful I waited upon and served my motherin law and father-in-law.</p>
<p id='7'>पैशुन्ये न प्रवामि न ममैतन्मनोगतम्। अद्वारि न च तिष्ठामि चिरं न कथयामि च॥<br />This was my resolution that I should never act deceitfully. I never used of stay at the door of our house nor did I speak long with anybody.</p>

<p id='9'>कार्यार्थं निर्गतं चापि भार्तारं गृहमागतम्। आसनेनोपसंयोज्य पूजयामि समाहिता॥<br />When my husband, having left home upon any business, used to return, I always served him by giving him a seat, and adored him with respect.</p>
<p id='10'>यदन्नं नाभिजानाति यद् भोज्यं नाभिनन्दति। भक्ष्यं वा यदि वा लेह्यं तत्सर्वे वर्जयाम्यहम्॥<br />I never ate food of any kind which was unknown to my husband and with which my husband was not pleased.</p>
<p id='11'>कुटुम्बार्थं समानीतं यत्किञ्चित् कार्यमेव तु। प्रातरुत्थाय तत्सर्वं कारयामि करोमि च॥<br />Rising early in the morning I did and caused to be done whatever was brought about and required to be done for the sake of relatives and kinsmen.</p>
