<h3>ANUGITA PARVA: Chapter 42</h3><h4>The five great clements</h4><p id='1'>ब्रह्मोवाच अहंकारात् प्रसूतानि महाभूतानि पञ्च वै। पृथिवी वायुराकाशमापो ज्योतिश्च पञ्चमम्॥<br />Brahman said From Egoism were, indeed, born the five great elements. They are earth, air, ether, water and light numbering the fifth.</p>
<p id='2'>तेषु भूतानि मुह्यन्ति महाभूतेषु पञ्चसु। शब्दस्पर्शनरूपेषु रसगन्धक्रियासु च॥<br />In these five great clements, in the matter of the operations of sound, touch, colour, tasie, and smell, all creatures become deluded.</p>
<p id='3'>महाभूतविनाशान्ते प्रलये प्रत्युपस्थिते। सर्वप्राणभृतां धीरा महदभ्युद्यते भयम्॥<br />When at the close of the destruction of the great elements, the dissolution of the universe comes, O wisemen, a great fear possesses all living creatures.</p>
<p id='4'>यद् यस्माज्जायते भूतं तत्र तत् प्रविलीयते। लीयन्ते प्रतिलोमानि जायन्ते चोत्तरोत्तरम्॥<br />Every existent object is dissolved into that from which it is produced. The dissolution takes place in an order that is the reverse of that in which creation occurs. Indeed, as regards birth, they are born from one another.</p>
<p id='5'>ततः प्रलीने सर्वस्मिन् भूते स्थावरजङ्गमे। स्मृतिमन्तस्तदा धीरा न लीयन्ते कदाचन॥<br />Then, when all existent objects, mobile and immobile, become become dissolved, wise men possessed of a powerful memory never dissolve.</p>
<p id='6'>शब्दः स्पर्शस्तथा रूपं रसो गन्धश्च पञ्चमः। क्रियाः करणनित्याः स्युरनित्या मोहसंज्ञिताः॥<br />Sound, touch, colour, taste, and smell numbering the fifth, are effects. They are, however, inconstant, and called by the name of delusion.</p>
<p id='7'>लोभप्रजनसम्भूता निर्विशेषा ह्यकिंचनाः। मांसशोणितसंघाता अन्योन्यस्पोपजीविनः॥ बहिरात्मान इत्येते दीनाः कृपणजीवनः। प्राणापानावुदानश्च समानो व्यान एव च॥ अन्तरात्मनि चाप्येते नियताः पञ्च वायवः। वाड्मनोबुद्धिभिः सार्द्धमिदमष्टात्मकं जगत्॥<br />Generated by the production of cupidity, not different from one another, without reality, connected with flesh and blood, and depending upon one another, existing outside the soul, these are all helpless and powerless. Prana and Apana, and Udana and Samana and Vyana, these five vital airs are always closely attached to the soul. Together with speech, mind, and understanding, they form the universe of eight ingredients.</p>
<p id='8'>त्वध्राणश्रोत्रचढूंषि रसना वाक् च संयताः। विशुद्धं च मनो यस्य बुद्धिश्चाव्यभिचारिणी॥ अष्टौ यस्याग्नयो ह्येते न दहन्ते मनः सदा। स तद् ब्रह्म शुभं याति तस्माद् भूयो न विद्यते॥<br />He whose skin, nose, ear, eyes, tongue, and speech are controlled, whose mind is pure, and whose understanding deviates not (from the right path), and whose mind is never burnt by those eight fires, succeeds in acquiring that auspicious Brahma than which nothing superior exists.</p>
<p id='9'>एकादश च यान्याहुरिन्द्रियाणि विशेषतः। अहंकारात् प्रसूतानि तानि वक्ष्याम्यहं द्विजाः॥<br />I shall now, O twice-born ones, mention particularly, those which have been called the eleven organs and which have originated from Egoism.</p>

<p id='11'>इन्द्रियग्राम इत्येष मन एकादशं भवेत्। एतं ग्रामं जयेत् पूर्वं ततो ब्रह्म प्रकाशते॥<br />These form the group of organs, with mind numbering as the eleventh. One should first subdue this group. Then will Brahma shine forth (in him).</p>
<p id='12'>बुद्धीन्द्रियाणि पञ्चाहुः पञ्चकर्मेन्द्रियाणि च। श्रोत्रादीन्यपि पञ्चाहुद्धियुक्तानि तत्त्वतः॥<br />Five amongst these are called organs of knowledge, and five, organs of action. The five beginning with the ear are connected with knowledge.</p>
<p id='13'>अविशेषाणि चान्यानि कर्मयुक्तानि यानि तु। उभयत्र मनो ज्ञेयं बुद्धिस्तु द्वादशी भवेत्॥<br />The rest, however, which are connected with action, are without distinction. The mind should be considered as belonging to both. The understanding is the twelfth in the top.</p>
<p id='14'>इत्युक्तानीन्द्रियाण्येतान्येकादश यथाक्रमम्। मन्यन्ते कृतमित्येवं विदित्वा तानि पण्डिताः॥<br />Thus have been enumerated the eleven organs in due order. Learned man, having understood these, think they have done everything.</p>

Some are born of eggs; some are born of germs which; spring upwards, passing through the earth; some are born of fifth; and some are born of fleshy balls in wombs.</p>

Those living creatures which take birth after the lapse of sometime, bursting through the earth, are said to be germ-born beings, O foremost of twice-bom persons! Creatures of two fect or of many fect, and those which move crookedly, are the beings born of wombs. Among them are some which are deformed, you best of men! The eternal womb of Brahma should be known to be of two kinds, viz., penance and meritorious acts. Such is the doctrine of the learned. Action should be understood to be of various kinds, such as sacrifice, gifts made at sacrifices, and the meritorious duty of study for every one that is born; such is the teaching of the ancients. He who duly understands this, comes to be considered as possessed of Yoga, you chief of twice-born persons.</p>
<p id='34'>विमुक्तः सर्वपापेभ्य इति चैव निवोधता यथावदध्यात्मविधिरेष वः कीर्तितो मया॥<br />Know also that such a man becomes freed too from all his sins. I have thus described to you duly the doctrine of spiritual science.</p>

<p id='36'>क्षीणे मनसि सर्वस्मिन् च जन्मसुखमिष्यते। ज्ञानसम्पन्नसत्त्वानां तत् सुखं विदुषां मतम्॥<br />When everything is immersed in the mind, one no longer regards highly the pleasures of life. Learned men, whose understandings are furnished with knowledge, consider that as true happiness.</p>
<p id='37'>अतः परं प्रवक्ष्यामि सूक्ष्मभावकरीं शिवाम्। निवृत्तिं सर्वभूतेषु मृदुना दारुणेन च॥<br />I shall, after this, tell you of renunciation about all entities by means gentle and hard, which produces attachment to subtle topics and which is fraught with auspiciousness.</p>

<p id='41'>इन्द्रियाणां निरोधेन सर्वेषां विषयैषिणाम्। मुनेर्जनपदत्यागादध्यात्माग्निः समिध्यते॥<br />Through suppression of all the senses which always hanker after their objects, and abandonment of inhabited places, the spiritual fire blazes forth in the man of contemplation.</p>
<p id='42'>यथाग्निरिन्धनैरिद्धो महाज्योतिः प्रकाशते। तथेन्द्रियनिरोधेन महानात्मा प्रकाशते॥<br />As a fire, fed with fuel, becomes bright on account of the burning flames it puts forth, so, on account of the repression of the senses, the great soul puts forth its effulgence.</p>
<p id='43'>यदा पश्यति भूतानि प्रसन्नात्माऽऽत्मनो हृदि। स्वयंज्योतिस्तदा सूक्ष्मात् सूक्ष्मं प्रन्पोत्यनुत्तमम्॥<br />When one with a tranquil soul sees all entities in his own heart, then, lighted by his own effulgence, one attains to that which is subtler than the subtle and which is peerless in excellence.</p>
<p id='44'>अग्नी रूपं पयः स्रोतो वायुः स्पर्शनपेव च। मही पङ्कधरं घोरमाकाशश्रवणं तथा॥ रोगशोकसमाविष्टं पञ्चस्रोतःसमावृतम्। पञ्चभूतसमायुक्तं नवद्वारं द्विदैवतम्॥ रजस्वलमथादृश्यं त्रिगुणं च त्रिधातुकम्। संसर्गाभिरतं मूढं शरीरमिति धारणा॥<br />It is settled that the body has fire for colour, water for blood and other liquids, wind for sense of touch, earth for the hideous holder of mind (viz., flesh and bones, etc.), space (or ether) for sound; that it is pervaded by disease and sorrow; that it is overwhelmed by five currents; that it is made up of the five elements; that it has nine doors and two deities; that it is full of passion; that it is unfit to be seen; that it made up of three qualities; that it has three elements, (viz., wind, bile, and phlegm); that it is delighted with attachments of every kind; that it is full of delusion.</p>
<p id='45'>दुश्चरं सर्वलोकेऽस्मिन् सत्त्वं प्रति समाश्रितम्! एतदेव हि लोकेऽस्मिन् कालचक्र प्रवर्तते॥ एतन्महार्णवं घोरमगाधं मोहसंज्ञितम्। विक्षिपेत् संक्षिपेच्चैव बोधयेत् सामरं जगत्॥<br />It is difficult of being moved in this mortal world, and it rests on the understanding as its stay. That body is, in called delusion. It is this body which stretches forth, contracts, and awakens the universe with the immortals.</p>
<p id='46'>कामं क्रोध भयं लोभमभिद्रोहमथानृतम्। इन्द्रियाणां निरोधेन सतस्त्यजति दुस्त्यजान्॥<br />By controlling the senses, one renounces lust, anger, fear, cupidity, enmity, and falsehood, which are cternal and, therefore, highly difficult to renounce.</p>
<p id='47'>यस्यैते निर्जिता लोके त्रिगुणाः पञ्चधातवः। व्योमि तस्य परं स्थानमानन्त्यमथ लभ्यते॥<br />He who has controlled these in this world, viz., the three qualities and the five elements of the body, has the Highest for his seat in the celestial region. By him is Infinity attained.</p>
<p id='48'>पञ्चेन्द्रियमहाकूलां मनोवेगमहोदकाम्। नदीं मोहह्रदां तीर्खा कामक्रोधावुभौ जयेत्॥<br />Crossing the river which has the five senses for its steep banks, the mental inclinations for its powerful waters, and delusion for its lake, one should control both lust and anger,</p>

<p id='50'>सर्ववित् सर्वभूतेषु विन्दत्यात्मानमात्मनि। एकधा बहुधा चैव विकुर्वाणस्ततस्ततः॥<br />Understanding all things, he sees his self, with self, in all creatures, sometimes as one and sometimes as various, changing form from time to time.</p>
