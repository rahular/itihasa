Forsooth, this knowledge that I have is the result of your grace towards me.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>चित्तं च सुप्रसन्नं मे त्वद्भावगतमच्युत। विपिवृत्तं च मे शापादिति विद्धि परंतप॥<br />O you of unfading glory, my heart is possessed of cheerful tranquility on account of its being devoted to you. Know, O chastiser of enemies, that my heart is no longer inclined to curse you.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>यदि त्वनुग्रहं कंचित् त्वत्तोऽर्हामि जनार्दन। द्रष्टुमिच्छामि ते रूपमैश्वरं तन्निदर्शय॥<br />If, O Janardana, I deserve the least grace from you, do you then show me once your supreme form.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच ततः स तस्मै प्रीतात्मा दर्शयामास तद् वपुः। शाश्वतं वैष्णवं धीमान् ददृशे यद् धनंजयः॥<br />Pleased with him, the holy one then showed Uttanka that eternal Vaishnava form which Dhananjaya of great intelligence had seen.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>स ददर्श महात्मानं विश्वरूपं महाभुजम्। सहस्रसूर्यप्रतिमं दीप्तिमत् पावकोपमम्॥ सर्वमाकाशमावृत्य तिष्ठन्तं सर्वतोमुखम्।<br />Utanka saw the greet Vasudeva of universal form, gifted with mighty-arms. The effulgence of that form was like that of a burning fire or a thousand suns. It stood before him filling all space. It had faces on every side.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>तद् दृष्ट्वा परमं रूपं विष्णोर्वैष्णवमद्भुतम्। विस्मयं च ययौ विप्रस्तं दृष्ट्वा परमेश्वरम्॥<br />Sceing that high and wonderful Vaishnava form of Vishnu, in fact, seeing the Supreme Lord in (that guise) the Brahmana Utanka became filled with wonder.</p>

I bow to you, O soul of the universe, O parent of all things! With your feet you have covered the entire Earth, and with your head you fill the firmament.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>द्यावापृथिव्योर्यन्मध्यं जठरेण तवावृतम्। भुजाभ्यामावृताश्चाशास्त्वमिदं सर्वमच्युत॥<br />That which lies between the Earth and the firmament has been filled by your stomach. All the points of the compass are covered by your arms. O you of unfading glory, you are all this.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>संहरस्व पुनर्देव रूपमक्षय्यमुत्तमम्। पुनस्त्वां स्वेन रूपेण द्रष्टुमिच्छामि शाश्वतम्॥<br />Do you withdraw this excellent and indestructible forin of yours. I wish to see you now in your own (human) form which too, is eternal.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>तमुवाच प्रसन्नात्मा गोविन्दो जनमेजय। वरं वृणीष्वेति तदा तमुत्तङ्कोऽब्रवीदिदम्॥ पर्याप्त एष एवाद्य परस्त्वत्तो महाद्युते। यत् ते रूपमिदं कृष्णं पश्यामि पुरुषोत्तम॥<br />To him, O Janaimejaya, Govinda of contented spirit said these words, Do you ask for some boon! To him Utanka, however said this is a sufficient boon from you for the present, O you of great splendour, in that, O Krishna, I have seen this form of yours, O foremost of all beings!</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>तमब्रवीत् पुनः कुष्णो मा त्वमत्र विचारय। अवश्यमेतत् कर्तव्यममोघं दर्शनं मम॥<br />Krishna, however, once more said to him, 'Do not scruple in this matter! This must be done! A sight of my form cannot be fruitless!</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>अवश्यं करणीयं च यद्येतन्मन्यसे विभो। तोयमिच्छामि यत्रेष्टं मरुष्वेतद्धि दुर्लभम्॥<br />I must accomplish that, O lord, which you think should be done! I wish to have water wherever my wish for it may arise. Water is scarce in such deserts!</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>ततः संहृत्य तत् तेजः प्रोवाचोत्तङ्कमीश्वरः। एष्टव्ये सति चिन्त्योऽहमित्युक्त्वा द्वारकां ययौ॥<br />Withdrawing that energy, the Supreme Lord then said to Utanka, Whenever you will require water, think of me!' Having said so, he proceeded towards of Dwraka.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>ततः कदाचिद् भगवानुत्तङ्गस्तोयकांक्षया। तृषितः परिचक्राम मरौ सस्मार चाच्युतम्॥<br />Subsequently, one day, the illustrious Utanka, solicitous of water and greatly thirsty, wandered over the desert. In course of his wanderings he thought of Krishna of unfading glory.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>ततो दिग्वाससं धीमान् मातङ्ग मलपङ्किनम्। अपश्यत मरौ तस्मिश्वयूथपरिवारितम्॥<br />The intelligent Rishi then saw in that desert a naked hunter (of the Chandala class), all besmeared with dirt, surrounded by a pack of dogs.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>भीषणं बद्धनिस्त्रिंशं बाणकार्मुकधारिणम्। तस्याधः स्रोतसोऽपश्यद् वारि भूरिद्विजोत्तमः॥<br />Extremely fierce-loO king, he carried a sword and was armed with bow and arrows. That foremost of twice-born ones saw copious streams of water issuing from the urinary organs of that hunter.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>स्मरन्नेव च तं प्राह मातङ्गः प्रहसन्निव! एहुनङ्क प्रतीच्छस्व मनो वारि भृगूद्वह॥<br />As soon as Utanka had thought of Krishna, that hunter smilingly addressed him, saying, O Utanka, oyou or Bhrigu's race, do yoil accept this water from me.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>कृपा हि पे सुमहती त्वां दृष्ट्वा तृट्समाश्रितम्। इत्युक्तस्तेन स मुनिस्तत् तोयं नाभ्यनन्दत॥<br />Seeing you afflicted by thirst I have felt great mercy for you! Thus addressed by the hunter, the ascetic showed no inclination to accept that water.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>चिक्षेप च स तं धीमान् वाग्भिरुयाभिरच्युतम्। पुनः पुनश्च मानङ्गः पिबस्वेति तमब्रवीत्॥<br />The intelligent Utanka even began to blame Krishna of undecaying glory. The hunter, however again and again addressed the Rishi, saying, 'Drink!'</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>न चापिबत् स सक्रोधः क्षुभितेनानन्तरात्मना। ते स तथा निश्चयात् तेन प्रत्याख्यातो महात्मना॥ श्वभिः सह महाराज नत्रैवान्तरधीयता उत्तङ्कस्तं तथा दृष्ट्वा ततो वोडितमानस:॥<br />The ascetic refused to drink the water thus given. On the other hand, with heart stricken with hunger and thirst, he even became angry. Disregarded by the great Rishi through that conviction, the hunter, O king, with his pack of dogs, disappeared there and then. Seeing that disappearance, Utanka felt himself ashamed.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>मेने प्रलब्धमात्मानं कृष्णेनामित्रघातिना। अथ तेनैव मार्गेण शङ्खचक्रगदाधरः॥ आजगाम महाबुद्धिरुत्तङ्कश्चैनमब्रवीत्। न युक्तं तादृशं दातुं त्वया पुरुषसत्तमा॥ सलिलं विप्रमुख्येभ्यो मातङ्गस्रोतसा विभो। इत्युक्तवचनं तं तु महाबुद्धिर्जनार्दनः॥ उत्तङ्क श्लक्ष्णया वाचा सान्त्वयनिदमब्रवीत्। यादृशेनेह रूपेण योग्यं दातुं धृतेन वै॥ तादृशं खलु दत्तं यच्च त्वं नावबुध्यथा:। मया त्वदर्थमुक्तो वै वज्रपाणिः पुरंदरः॥<br />He even thought that Krishna, that destroyer of enemies, had beguiled him. Soon after, the holder of the conch and discus and mace, gifted with great intelligence, came to Utanka by the way (along which the hunter had come). Addressing Krishna, the Brahmana said, 'O foremost of beings, it was hardly propet for you to offer water to foremost of Brahmanas in the form of a hunter's urine, O lord! Utanka who said these words, Janardana of great intelligence replied, comforting him with many soft words, “That form which it was proper to assume for offering you water, in that form was water was water offered to you! But, alas, you could not understand it! The holder of the thunderbolt, Purandara, was requested by me for your sake.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>उत्तङ्कायामृतं देहि तोयरूपमिति प्रभुः। स मामुवाच देवेन्द्रो न मोऽमर्त्यतां व्रजेत्॥<br />My words to that powerful celestial were, Do you give nectar in the form of water to Utanka. The king of the celestials replied to me, saying, It is not meet that a mortal should become immortal!</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>अन्यमस्मै वरं देहीत्यसकृद् भृगुनन्दन। अमृतं देयमित्येव मयोक्तः स शचीपतिः॥<br />Let some other boon be granted to Utanka! O son of Bhrigu's race, these words were repeatedly addressed to me. The husband of Sachi, however, was once more requested by me in these words, viz., even nectar should be given to Utanka!</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>स मां प्रसाद्य देवेन्द्रः पुनरेवेदमब्रवीत्। यदि देरमवश्यं वै मातङ्गोऽहं महामते॥ भूत्वामृतं प्रदास्यामि भार्गवाय महात्मने। यद्येवं प्रतिगृह्णाति भार्गवोऽमृतमद्य वै॥ प्रदातुमेष गच्छामि भार्गवोऽस्यामृतं विभो। प्रत्याख्यातस्त्वहं तेन दास्यामि न कथंचन॥ स तथा समयं कृत्वा तेन रूपेण वासवः। उपस्थितस्त्वया चापि प्रत्याख्यातोऽमृतं ददत्॥ चाण्डालरूपी भगवान् सुमहांस्ते व्यतिक्रमः। यत् तु शक्यं मया कर्तुं भूय एव तवेप्सितम्॥<br />The king of the celestials, then comforting me, said, If, Oyou of great intelligence, nectar is to be given to him. I shall then assume the form of a hunter and give it to that great descendant of Bhrigu. If that son of Bhrigu accepts it thus, I then go to him, O lord, for giving it to him! If, however, he sends me away from disregard, I shall not then give it to him by any means.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>तोयेप्सा तव दुर्धर्षां करिष्ये सफलामहम्। येष्वहःसु च ते ब्रह्मन् सलिलेप्सा भविष्यति॥ तदा मरौ भविष्यन्ति जलपूर्णाः पयोधराः। रसवच्च प्रदास्यन्ति तोयं ते भृगुनन्दन॥ उत्तङ्कमेघा इत्युक्ताः ख्याति यास्यन्ति चापि ते॥<br />Having made this agreement with me, Vasava appeared before you, in that disguise, for giving thee nectar. You, however, did disregard him and send him away, seeing that the illustrious one had put on the guise of a Chandala. Thy fault has been great. Once more, about your desire. I am prepared to do what is in my power. Indeed, this painful thirst of yours, I shall arrange, shall be satisfied. On those days, o twice-born one, in which you will feel a desire for water, clouds wellcharged with water will rise over this desert. Those clouds, O son of Bhrigu's race, will give you savoury water to drink. Indeed, those clouds will become known in the world as Utanka-clouds.</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>इत्युक्तः प्रीतिमान् विप्रः कृष्णेन स बभूव ह। अद्याप्युत्तङ्कमेघाच मरौ वर्षन्ति भारत॥<br />Thus addressed by Krishna, Utanka became Glad, and to this day, O Bharata, Utankaclouds (appear and) shower rain on arid deserts.</p>
