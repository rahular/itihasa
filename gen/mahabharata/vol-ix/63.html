<h3>ANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 63</h3><h4>The fruits of gifts to Brahmana and others. The replies of Narada</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच कानि दानानि लोकेऽस्मिन् दातुकामो महीपतिः। गुणाधिकेभ्यो विप्रेभ्यो दद्याद् भरतसत्तम॥ केन तुष्यन्ति ते सद्यः किं तुष्टाः प्रदिशन्ति च। शंस मे तन्महाबाहो फलं पुण्यकृतं महत्॥<br />Yudhishthira said When a king wishes to make gifts in this world, what, indeed, are those gifts which he should make, O best of the Bharatas, to such Brahmanas as are endued with superior accomplishments? What gift is that by which the Brahmanas become readily pleased? What fruits do they give in return? O you of powerful arms, tell me what is the high reward which can be won through the merit of gifts.</p>
<p id='2'>दत्तं किं फलवद् राजनिह लोके परत्र च। भवत: श्रोतुमिच्छामि तन्मे विस्तरतो वद॥<br />What gifts, O king; yield rewards both in this world and in the next? I wish to hear all this from you. Do you describe to me all this in detail.</p>

<p id='4'>नारद उवाच अन्नमेव प्रशंसन्ति देवा ऋषिगणास्तथा। लोकतन्त्रं हि संज्ञाश्च सर्वमन्ने प्रतिष्ठितम्॥<br />Narada said The celestials and all the Rishis speak highly of food. The course of the world and the intellectual faculties have all been fixed on food.</p>
<p id='5'>अन्नेन सदृशं दानं न भूतं न भविष्यति। तस्मादन्नं विशेषेण दातुमिच्छन्ति मानवाः॥<br />There has never been, nor will be, any gift equal to the gift of food. Hence, men always wish particularly to make gifts of food.</p>
<p id='6'>अन्नमूर्जस्करं लोके प्राणाश्चान्ने प्रतिष्ठिताः। अन्नेन धार्यते सर्वं विश्वं जगदिदं प्रभो॥<br />In this world, food is the root of energy and strength. The vital airs are established on food. It is food that keeps up the wide universe, O powerful one.</p>

He is entitled to the first part of every food. That house increases in prosperity to which the Brahmanas go from desire of getting alms and from which they return honoured on account of their desires being satisfied.
