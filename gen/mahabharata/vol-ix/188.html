<h3>ANUGITA PARVA: Chapter 20</h3><h4>The discourse of the married couple. The description of Brahman</h4><p id='1'>वासुदेव उवाच अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। दम्पत्योः पार्थ संवादो योऽभवद् भरतर्षभ॥<br />Regarding it is cited the old narrative, O son of Pritha, of the discourse that took place between a married couple.</p>
<p id='2'>ब्राह्मणी ब्राह्मणं कंचिज्ज्ञानविज्ञानपारगम्। दृष्ट्वा विविक्त आसीनं भार्या भर्तारमब्रवीत्॥ कं नु लोकं गमिष्यामि त्वामहं पतिमाश्रिता। न्यस्तकर्माणमासीनं कीनाशमविचक्षणम्॥<br />A certain Brahmana's wife, seeing the Brahmana, her husband, who was a complete master of every kind of knowledge and wisdom, seated in seclusion, said to him, Into what region shall I go, depending on you as my husband, you who are seated, having cast off all (religious) acts, who are harsh in your conduct towards me, and who undiscerning?</p>
<p id='3'>भार्याः पतिकृताँल्लोकानाप्नुवन्तीति नः श्रुतम्। त्वामहं पतिमासाद्य कां गमिष्यामि वै गतिम्॥<br />We have heard that a wife attains to those regions which are acquired by her husband. What, indeed, is the goal that I shall attain, having obtained you for my husband.</p>
<p id='4'>एवमुक्तः स शान्तात्मा तामुवाच हसन्निव। सुभगे नाभ्यसूयामि वाक्यस्यास्य तवातघे॥<br />Thus questioned, that Brahmana of tranquil soul then said to her, smilingly, O blessed dame, I am not offended with these words of yours, O sinless one.</p>
<p id='5'>ग्राह्यं दृश्यं च सत्यं वा यदिदं कर्म विद्यते। एतदेव व्यवस्यन्ति कर्म कर्मेति कर्मिणः॥<br />Whatever acts exist which are adopted with the help of others, which are seen and which are true, are done, as acts, by men, devoted to acts. are SO are</p>
<p id='6'>मोहमेव नियच्छन्ति कर्मणा ज्ञानवर्जिताः। नैष्कर्म्यं न च लोकेऽस्मिन् मुहूर्तमपि लभ्यते॥<br />Those persons who are destitute of knowledge, only store delusion by deeds. Freedom from acts, again, cannot even be momentarily attained in this world.</p>
<p id='7'>कर्मणा मनसा वाचा शुभं वा यदि वाशुभम्। जन्मादिमूर्तिभेदान्तं कर्म भूतेषु वर्तते॥<br />From birth to the attainment of a different form, action good or bad, and accomplished by deeds, mind, or speech, exists in all beings.</p>
<p id='8'>रक्षोभिर्वघ्यमानेषु दृश्यद्रव्येषु वर्त्मसु। आत्मस्थमात्मना तेभ्यो दृष्टमायतनं मया॥<br />Those paths (of action) which characterised by visible objects (such as Somajuice and clarified butter for libations) being destroyed by Rakshasa, turning away from them I have perceived the scat (of the soul) that is in the body, with the help of the soul.</p>
<p id='9'>यत्र तद् ब्रह्म निर्द्वन्द्वं यत्र सोमः सहाग्निना। व्यवायं कुरुते नित्यं धीरो भूतानि धारयन्॥<br />There lives Brahma transcending all pairs of opposites; there Soma with Agni; and there the mover of the under standing, (viz., Vayu) always moves, upholding all creatures.</p>
<p id='10'>यत्र ब्रह्मादयो युक्तास्तदक्षरमुपासते। विद्वांसः सुव्रता यत्र शान्तात्मानो जितेन्द्रियाः॥<br />It is for that seat that the Grandfather Brahman and others, concentrated in Yoga, adorc thc Indestructible. It is for that seat that men of learning an excellent vows, of tranquil souls, and of senses completely controlled, strive.</p>
<p id='11'>घ्राणेन न तदा यं नास्वाद्यं चैव जिह्वया। स्पर्शनेन तदस्पृश्यं मनसा त्ववगम्यते॥<br />That is not capable of being smelt by the sense of smell; nor tasted by the tongue; or touched by the organs of It is by the mind that that is attained.</p>
<p id='12'>चक्षुषामविषह्यं च यत् किंचिच्छ्रवणात् परम्। अगत्वमरसस्मर्शमरूपाशब्दलक्षणम्॥<br />It is incapable of being conquered by the cye. It is above the sense of hearing. It is shorn of scent, taste, touch, and form as attributes.</p>
<p id='13'>यतः प्रवर्तते तन्त्रं यत्र च प्रतितिष्ठति। प्राणोऽपान: समानश्च व्यानश्चोदार एव च॥ तत एव प्रवर्तन्ते तदेव प्रविशन्ति च। समानव्यानयोर्मध्ये प्राणापानौ विचेरतुः॥<br />It is that from which proceeds the wellordained universe, and it that upon which it depends. The vital airs called Prana, Apana, Samana, Vyana and Udana, flow from it, and it is that into which they again enter. The vital airs Prana and Apana move between Samana and Vyana.</p>
<p id='14'>तस्मिल्लीने प्रलीयेत समानो व्यान एव च। अपान प्रणयोर्मध्ये उदानो व्याप्य तिष्ठति। तस्माच्छयानं पुरुषं प्राणापानौ न मुञ्चतः॥<br />When the soul sleeps, both Samana and Vyana are absorbed. Between Apana and Frana, Udana lives, pervading all.</p>
<p id='15'>प्राणानामायतत्वेन तमुदानं प्रचक्षते। तस्मात् तपो व्यवस्यन्ति मन्दतं ब्रह्मवादिनः॥<br />Hence, Prana and Apana do not desert a sleeping person. On account of its controlling all the vital airs, the controlling breath is so called Udana.</p>
<p id='16'>तेषामन्योन्यभक्षाणां सर्वेषां देहचारिणाम्। अग्निर्वैश्वानरो मध्ये सप्तधा दीव्यतेऽन्तरा॥ घ्राणं जिहा च चक्षुश्चत्वक् च श्रोत्रं च पञ्चमम्। मनो बुद्धिश्च सप्तैता जिह्वा वैश्वानरार्चिषः॥ प्रेयं दृश्यं च पेयं च स्पृश्यं श्रव्यं तथैव च। मन्तव्यमथ वोद्धव्यं ताः सप्त समिधो मम॥ घ्राता भक्षयिता द्रष्टा स्प्रष्टा श्रोता च पञ्चमः। मन्ता बोद्धा च सप्तैते भवन्ति परमविजः॥ प्रेये पेये च दृश्ये च स्पृश्ये श्रव्ये तथैव च। मन्तव्येऽप्यथ बोद्धव्ये सुभगे पश्य सर्वदा॥<br />Hence, utterers of Brahma practise penances which have myself for their goal. In the midst of all those vital airs which swallow up one another and move within the body, shines forth the fire called Vaishvanara made up of seven flames. The nose, the tongue, the eye, the skin, the car which numbers the fifth, the mind, and the understanding, these are the seven tongues of that Vaishvanara's flame. That which is smelt that which is seen, that which is drunk, that which is touched, as also that which is heard, that which is thought of, and that which is understood, these are the seven sorts of fuel for me. That which smells, that which eats, that which sces, that which touches, that which sees, that which touches, that which hears, numbering the fifth; that which thinks, and that which understands, these are the seven great officiating priests.</p>
<p id='17'>हवींष्यग्निषु होतार: सप्तधा सप्त सप्तसु। सम्यक् प्रक्षिप्य विद्वांसो जनयन्ति स्वयोनिषु॥ पृथिवी वायुराकाशमापो ज्योतिश्च पञ्चमम्। मनो बुद्धिश्च सप्तैता योनिरित्येव शब्दिताः॥ हविर्भूता गुणाः सर्वे प्रविशन्त्यग्निजं गुणम्। अन्तर्वासमुषित्वा च जायन्ते स्वासु योनिषु॥ तत्रैव च निरुध्यन्ते प्रलये भूतभावने। ततः संजायते गन्धस्ततः संजायते रसः॥<br />Mark, O blessed one, learned sacrificers duly casting seven libations in seven ways in the seven fires, viz., that which is smelt, that which is drunk, that which is smelt, that which is drunk, that which is seen, that which is touched, as also that which is heard, that which is thought of, and that which is understood, create them in their own wombs. Earth, Wind, Ether, Weather, and Light numbering as the fifth, Mind and Understanding, these seven are called wombs (of all things). All the attributes which form the sacrificial offerings, enter into the attribute that is born of the fire; and having lived within that dwelling become reborn in their respective wombs. There also, viz., in that which generates all beings, they remain absorbed during the period for which dissolution lasts.</p>
<p id='18'>ततः संजायते रूपं ततः स्पर्शोऽभिजायते। ततः संजायते शब्दः संशयस्तत्र जायते। ततः संजायते निष्ठा जन्मैतत् सप्तधा विदुः॥<br />From that is produced smell, from that is produced taste, from that is produced colour, and from that is produced touch; from that is produced sound; from that originates doubt; and from that is produce a resolution. Thus is what is known as the sevenfold creation.</p>
<p id='19'>अनेनैव प्रकारेण प्रगृहीतं पुरातनैः। पूर्णाहुतिभिरापूर्णास्त्रिभिः पूर्यन्ति तेजसा॥<br />It is thus that all this was comprehended by the ancients. By the three full and final libations, the full become full with light.</p>
