What is that act by doing which a king succeeds in enjoying both this world and the next.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>भीष्म उवाच एतद् राज्ञः कृत्यतममभिषिक्तस्य भारत। ब्राह्मणानामनुष्ठानमत्यन्तं सुखमिच्छता॥<br />Bhishma said Even this, viz., the worship of the Brahmanas, is the foremost of all those deeds, O Bharata, which have been laid down for a king duly installed on the throne if, indeed, he is desirous of acquiring great happiness.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>कर्तव्यं पार्थिवेन्द्रेण तथैव भरतर्षभ। श्रोत्रियान् ब्राह्मणान् वृद्धान् नित्यमेवाभिपूजयेत्॥<br />Even this is what the foremost of all kings should do. Know this well, O chief of Bharata's race. The king should always adore with reverence all righteous Brahmanas possessed of Vedic learning.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>पौरजानपदांश्चापि ब्राह्मणांश्च बहुश्रुतान्। सान्त्वेन भोगदानेन नमस्कारैस्तथार्चयेत्॥<br />The king should, with bows sweet speeches and gifts of all articles of enjoyment, adore all Brahmanas endued with great learning who may live in his city or provinces.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>एतत् कृत्यतमं राज्ञो नित्यमेवोपलक्षयेत्। यथाऽऽत्मानं यथा पुत्रांस्तथैतान् प्रतिपालयेत्॥<br />This is the foremost of all acts laid down for the king. Indeed, the king should always keep his eyes fixed on this. He should protect and cherish these, even as he protects his own self or his own children.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>ये चाप्येषां पूज्यतमास्तान् दृढं प्रतिपूजयेत्। तेषु शान्तेषु तद् राष्ट्र सर्वमेव विराजते॥<br />The king should adore with greater reverence those amongst the Brahmanas who may be worthy of it. When such men are freed from all anxiety, the whole kingdom shines in beauty.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>ते पूज्यास्ते नमस्कार्या भान्यास्ते पितरो यथा। तेष्वेव यात्रा लोकानां भूतानामिव वासवे॥<br />Such individuals are worthy of adoration. The king should bow his head to such individuals. Indeed, they should be honoured, even as one honours his father and grandfather. The course of conduct followed by men, depends upon them as the existence of all creatures depends upon Vasava.</p>

<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>नान्तमेषां प्रपश्यामि न दिशश्चाप्यपावृताः। कुपिताः समुदीक्षन्ते दावेष्वग्निशिखा इव ॥<br />I do not see anything that can destroy them. Their power seems to be uncontrolled, being capable of reaching to the last end of the universe. When angry, their looks fall upon men and things like a burning flame of fire upon a forest. are</p>

Their virtues and powers are extraordinary and immeasurable. Some amongst them are like wells and pits with mouths covered by grass and creepers, while others resemble the sky shorn of clouds and darkness.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>प्रसह्यकारिणः केचित् कार्पासमृदवो परे। सन्ति चैषामतिशठास्तथैवान्ये तपस्विनः॥<br />Some amongst them of dreadful dispositions. Some are as mild and soft in disposition as cotton. Some amongst them are very cunning. Some amongst them are given to the practice of penances.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>कृषिगोरक्ष्यमप्येके भैक्ष्यमन्येऽप्यनुष्ठिताः। चौराश्चान्येऽनृताश्चान्ये तथान्ये नटनर्तकाः॥<br />Some amongst them are employed in agricultural pursuits. Some amongst them are engaged in the keep of kine. Some amongst them live upon eleemosynary alms. Some amongst them are even thieves. Some amongst them are found of creating quarrels and disputes. Some again, amongst them are actors and dancers.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>सर्वकर्मसहाश्चान्ये पार्थिवेष्वितरेषु च। विविधाकारयुक्ताश्च ब्राह्मणा भरतर्षभ॥<br />Some amongst them are competent to perform all feats ordinary and extraordinary. The Brahmanas, O chief of Bharata's race, are of various aspects and conduct.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>नानाकर्मसु रक्तानां बहुकर्मोपजीविनाम्। धर्मज्ञानां सतां तेषां नित्यमेवानुकीर्तयेत्॥<br />One should always sing the praises of the Brahmanas who are conversant with all duties, who are righteous of conduct, who are given to various kinds of acts, and who are seen to derive their sustenance from various callings.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>पितॄणां देवतानां च मनुष्योरगरक्षसाम्। पुराप्येते महाभागा ब्राह्मणा वै जनाधिप॥<br />The Brahmanas, O king, who are highly blessed are older in respect of their origin than the departed manes, the deities human beings, the Snakes, and the Rakshasas.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>नैते देवैर्न पितृभिर्न गन्धर्वैर्न राक्षसैः। नासुरैर्न पिशाचैश्च शक्या जेतुं द्विजातयः॥<br />These twice born persons are incapable of being defeated by the deities or the departed manes, or the Gandharvas or the Rakshasas, or the Asuras or the Pishachas.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>अदैवं दैवतं कुर्युर्दैवतं चाप्यदैवतम्। यमिच्छेयुः स राजा स्याद् यो नेष्टः स पराभवेत्।।१७<br />The Brahmanas are competent to make him a god, that is not a god. They can, again, divest one who is a deity of his status as such. He becomes a king, whom they wish to make a king. He on the other hand, is crushed whom they do not love or like.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>परिवादं च ये कुयुर्ब्राह्मणानामचेतसः। सत्यं ब्रवीमि ते राजन् विनश्येयुर्न संशयः॥<br />I tell you truly, O king, that those foolish persons, forsooth, meet with destruction who caluminate the Brahmanas and utter their dispraise.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>निन्दाप्रशंसाकुशलाः कीर्त्यकीर्तिपरायणाः। परिकुप्यति ते राजन् सततं द्विषतां द्विजाः॥<br />Expert in praise and dispraise, and themselves the origin or cause of other people's fame and ignominy, the Brahmanas, O king, always become angry with those who seek to injure others.</p>

<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>शका यवनकाम्बोजास्तास्ताः क्षत्रियजातयः। वृषलत्वं परिगता ब्राह्मणानामदर्शनात्॥<br />It is on account of the absence of Brahmanas from among them that the Shakas, the Yavanas, the Kamvojas and other Kshatriya tribes have become fallen and degraded into Shudras.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>द्राविडाश्च कलिङ्गाश्च पुलिन्दाश्चाप्युशीनराः। कोलिसर्पा माहिषकास्तास्ताः क्षत्रियजातयः॥ वृषलत्वं परिगता ब्राह्मणानामदर्शनात्। श्रेयान् पराजयस्तेभ्यो न जयो जयतां वर॥<br />The Dravidas, the Kalingas, the Pulindas the Ushinaras, the Kolisarpas, the Mahishakas, and other Kshatriyas, have, on account of the absence of Brahmanas from among their midst, become degraded into Shudras. Defeat from them is preferable to victory, O foremost of victorious persons.</p>

The great Rishis have said that Brahmanicide is a heinous sin.</p>

<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>दुर्ग्राह्यो मुष्टिना वायुर्दुःस्पर्शः पाणिना शशी। दुर्धरा पृथिवी राजन् दुर्जया ब्राह्मणा भुवि॥<br />One cannot seize the wind with his hands. One cannot touch the moon with his hand. One cannot support the earth on his arms. Similarly, O king, one is not able to defeat the Brahmanas in this world,</p>
