<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 125</h3><h4>The mystery of duties and gifts</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच जन्म मानुष्यकं प्राप्य कर्मक्षेत्रं सुदुर्लभम्। श्रेयोऽर्थिना दरिद्रेण किं कर्तव्यं पितामह॥<br />Yudhishthira said Tell me, O grandfather, how should a poor inan, desirous of achieving his own behoof, act after having acquired the status of humanity and come into this region of acts that is so difficult to acquire.</p>
<p id='2'>दानानामुत्तमं यच्च देयं यच्च यथा यथा। मान्यान् पूज्यांश्च गाङ्गेय रहस्यं वक्तुमर्हसि॥<br />Tell me also what is the best of all gifts, and what should be given under what circumstances? Tell me, O son of Ganga, who are truly worthy of honour and adoration. You should describe these mysteries to us.</p>
<p id='3'>वैशम्पायन उवाच एवं पृष्टो नरेन्द्रेण पाण्डवेन यशस्विना। धर्माणां परमं गुह्यं भीष्मः प्रोवाच पार्थिवम्॥<br />Vaishampayana said Thus accosted by that famous king, viz., the son of Pandu, Bhishma explained to that king these great mysteries about duty.</p>
<p id='4'>भीष्म उवाच शृणुष्वावहितो राजन् धर्मगुह्यानि भारत। यथा हि भगवान् व्यासः पुरा कथितवान् मयि॥<br />Bhishma said Listen to me with rapt attention, O king, as I explain to you, O Bharata, these mysteries of duties as the holy Vyasa had explained them to me formerly.</p>
<p id='5'>देवगुह्यमिदं राजन् यमेनाक्लिष्टकर्मणा। नियमस्थेन युक्तेन तपसो महतः फलम्॥<br />This subject is a mystery to the very celestials, O king. Yama of pure deeds, with the help of vows well observed and Yoga meditation, had acquired the knowledge of these mysteries as the high fruits of his penances.</p>
<p id='6'>येन यः प्रीयते देवः प्रीयन्ते पितरस्तथा। ऋषयः प्रमथा: श्रीश्च चित्रगुप्तो दिशां गजाः॥ ऋषिधर्मः स्मृतो यत्र सरहस्यो महाफलः। महादानफलं चैव सर्वयज्ञफलं तथा॥ यश्चैतदेवं जानीयाज्ज्ञात्वा वा कुरुतेऽनघ। सदोषोऽदोषवांश्चेह तैर्गुणैः सह युज्यते॥<br />What pleases deity, what pleases the departed manes, the Rishis, the companions of Mahadeva, the goddess Shri Chitragupta, and the powerful Elephants which rule the cardinal points of the compass, what forms the religion of the Rishis, the religion viz., which has many mysteries and which yields high fruits, the merits of what are called great gifts, and the merits of all the sacrifices he who knows these, O sinless one, and knowing acts according to his knowledge, becomes freed from stains if he has stains and acquires the inerits indicated.</p>
<p id='7'>दशसूनासमं चक्रं दशचक्रसमो ध्वजः। दशध्वजसमा वेश्या दशवेश्यासमो नृपः॥<br />One oilman is equal to ten butchers. Equal to ten oilmen is one drinker of alcohol. Equal to ten drinkers of alcohol is one harlot. Equal to ten harlots is a single king.</p>
<p id='8'>अर्धेनैतानि सर्वाणि नृपतिः कथ्यतेऽधिकः। त्रिवर्गसहितं शास्त्रं पवित्रं पुण्यलक्षणम्॥ धर्मव्याकरणं पुण्यं रहस्यश्रवणं महत्। श्रोतव्यं धर्मसंयुक्तं विहितं त्रिदशैः स्वयम्॥<br />A great king is said to be equal to half of these all. Hence, one should not accept gifts from these. On the other hand, one should attend to the science, which is sacred and which has virtue for its marks, of the threefold objects of life. Amongst these, Wealth and Pleasure are naturally attractive. Hence one should, with rapt attention, listen to the sacred expositions of Religion, for the fruits of listening to the mysteries of Religion are very great. One should certainly hear every subject bearing on Religion as ordained by the celestials themselves.</p>
<p id='9'>पितॄणां यत्र गुह्यानि प्रोच्यन्ते श्राद्धकर्मणि। देवतानां च सर्वेषां रहस्यं कथ्यतेऽखिलम्॥<br />In it is contained the ritual about the Shraddha in which have been declared the mysteries of the departed Manes. The mysteries about the deities have also been explained there.</p>
<p id='10'>ऋषिधर्मः स्मृतो यत्र सरहस्यो महाफलः। महायज्ञफलं चैव सर्वदानफलं तथा॥<br />It contains the duties and practices, productive of great merit, of the Rishis also, together with the mysteries attaching to them. It contains an exposition of the merits of great sacrifices and all kinds of gifts.</p>
<p id='11'>ये पठन्ति सदा मा येषां चैवोपतिष्ठति। श्रुत्वा च फलमाचष्टे स्वयं नारायणः प्रभुः॥<br />Those men who always read the scriptures about these subjects, those who bear them properly in their mind, and he who, having listened to them, follows them in practice, are all considered to be as holy and sinless as the powerful Narayana himself.</p>
<p id='12'>गवां फलं तीर्थफलं यज्ञानां चैव यत् फलम्। एतत् फलमवाप्नोति यो नरोऽतिथिपूजकः॥<br />The merits of the gift of kine, those that belong to the performance of ablutions in sacred waters, those that are acquired by the celebration of sacrifices, all these are acquired by that man who treats guests with respect.</p>
<p id='13'>श्रोतारः श्रद्दधानाश्च येषां शुद्ध च मानसम्। तेषां व्यक्त जिता लोकाः श्रद्दधनेन साधुना॥ मुच्यते किल्बिषाच्चैच न सा पापेन लिप्यते। धर्मे च लभते नित्यं प्रेत्य लोकगतो नरः॥<br />They who listen to these scriptures, they who are gifted with faith and they who have a pure heart, it is well known conquer many regions of felicity. Those pious men who are gifted with faith, become cleansed of all since and no sin can touch them. Such men always increase in virtue and succeed in attaining to the celestial region.</p>
<p id='14'>कस्यचित् त्वथ कालस्य देवदूतो यदृच्छया। स्थितो ह्यन्तर्हितो भूत्वा पर्यभाषत वासवम्॥<br />Once on a time a celestial messenger, coming to the court of Indra of his own accord, but remaining invisible, addressed the king of the deities in these words:</p>
<p id='15'>यौ तौ कामगुणोपेतावश्विनौ भिषजां वरौ। आज्ञयाहं तयोः प्राप्तः सनरान् पितृदैवतान्॥<br />At the command of Ashvini Kumars (the celestial physicians) and who are gifted with every desirable quality, I have come to this place where I see human beings the departed Manes and the celestials assembled together.</p>
<p id='16'>कस्माद्धि मैथुनं श्राद्धे दातुर्भोक्तुश्च वर्जितम्। किमर्थं च त्रयः पिण्डाः प्रविभक्ताः पृथक् पृथक्।।<br />Why, indeed, is sexual intercourse interdicted for the man who performs a Shraddha and for him also who eats at a Shraddha? Why are three rice balls offered separately at a Shraddha?</p>
<p id='17'>प्रथमः कस्य दातव्यो मध्यमः क्व च गच्छति। उत्तरश्च स्मृतः कस्य एतदिच्छागि वेदितुम्॥<br />To whom should the first of those balls be offered? To whom should the second one be offered? And whose has it been said is the third or the remaining one? I wish to know all this!</p>
<p id='18'>श्रद्दधनेन दूतेन भाषितं धर्मसंहितम्। पूर्वस्थास्त्रिदशाः सर्वे पितरः पूज्य खेचरम्॥<br />After the celestial messenger had said these words connected with virtue and duty, the celestials who were seated towards the east and the departed Manes also, praising that ranger of the sky, began as follows:</p>
<p id='19'>पितर ऊचुः स्वागतं तेऽस्तु भद्रं ते श्रूयतां खेचरोत्तम। गूढार्थः परमः प्रश्नो भवता समुदीरितः॥<br />The Pitris said Welcome are you and blessings upon you! Do you listen, O best of all rangers of the sky! The question you have put is a high one and fraught with deep import.</p>
<p id='20'>श्राद्धं दत्त्वा च भुक्त्वा च पुरुषो यःस्त्रियं व्रजेत्। पितरस्तस्य तं मासं तस्मिन् रेतसि शेरते।॥<br />The departed Manes of that man who indulges in sexual intercourse on the day he performs a Shraddha or eats at a Shraddha, have to lie for a whole month on his vital seed.</p>
<p id='21'>प्रविभागं तु पिण्डानां प्रवक्ष्याम्यनुपूर्वशः। पिण्डो ह्यधस्ताद् गच्छंस्तु अप आविश्य भावयेत्।।<br />We shall explain the classification of the riccballs offered at a Shraddha, The first ricehall should be thought of as being thrown into the waters.</p>
<p id='22'>पिण्डं तु मध्यमं तत्र पत्नी त्वेका समश्नुते। पिण्डस्तृतीयो यस्तेषां तं दद्याज्जातवेदसि॥<br />The second ball should be given to one of the wives to eat. The third ball should be thrown into the burning fire.</p>
<p id='23'>एष श्राद्धविधिः प्रोक्तो यथा धर्मो न लुप्यते। पितरस्तस्य तुष्यन्ति प्रहृष्टमनसः सदा॥ प्रजा विवर्धते चास्य अक्षयं चोपतिष्ठति।<br />This is the ordinance about the Shraddha. This is the ordinance of the rites of religion. The Pitris of that man who acts according to this ordinance become pleased with him and remain always cheerful. The progeny of such a man increases and he always commands endless riches.</p>
<p id='24'>देवदूत उवाच आनुपूर्वेण पिण्डानां प्रविभागः पृथक् पृथक्॥ पितॄणां त्रिषु सर्वेषां निरुक्तं कथितं त्वया।<br />The Celestial Messenger said You have explained the division of the ricc balls and their consignment one after another to the three, together with the reasons thereof.</p>
<p id='25'>एक:समुद्धृतः पिण्डो ह्यधस्तात् कस्य गच्छति॥ कं वा प्रीणयते देवं कथं तारयते पितॄन।<br />Whom does that riceball which is thrown into the waters reach? How does it , by being so thrown please the deities, and how does it rescue the departed Manes?</p>
<p id='26'>मध्यमं तु तदा पत्नी भुङ्क्तेऽनुज्ञातमेव हि॥ किमर्थं पितरस्तस्य कव्यमेव च भुञ्जते।<br />The second ball is eaten by the wife. That has been laid down in the ordinance. How do the Pitris of that man become the eaters thereof?</p>
<p id='27'>अत्र यस्त्वन्तिमः पिण्डो गच्छते जातवेदसम्॥ भवते का गतिस्तस्य कं वा समनुगच्छति।<br />The last ball goes into the burning fire. How does that ball succeed in finding its way to you, or who is he to whom it goes?</p>
<p id='28'>एतदिच्छाम्यहं श्रोतुं पिण्डेषु त्रिषु श गतिः॥ फलं वृत्तिं च मार्गं च यश्चैनं प्रतिपद्यते।<br />I wish to hear this, that is, what are the ends attained by the balls offered at Shraddhas when thus disposed of by being thrown into the waters, given to the wife, and thrown into the burning fire.</p>
<p id='29'>पितरः ऊचुः सुमहानेष प्रश्नो वै यस्त्वया समुदीरितः॥ रहस्यमद्भुतं चापि पृष्टाः स्म गगनेचर।<br />The Pitris said The question which you have asked is of deep import. It involves a mystery and is wonderful. We have been highly pleased with you, O rarger of the sky.</p>
<p id='30'>एतदेव प्रशसंन्ति देवाश्च मुनयस्तथा॥ तेऽप्येवं नाभिजानन्ति पितृकार्यविनिश्चयम्।<br />The very celestials and the Munis applaud acts done in honour of the departed Manes. Even they do not know what the certain conclusions are of the ordinances about the acts done in honour of the Pitris.</p>
<p id='31'>वर्जयित्वा महात्मानं चिरजीविनमुत्तमम्॥ पितृभक्तस्तु यो विप्रो वरलब्धो महायशाः।<br />Excepting the great, immortal and excellent Markandeya, that learned Brahmana of great fame, who is ever devoted to the Pitris, none amongst them is conversant with the mysteries of the ordinances about the Pitris.</p>
<p id='32'>त्रयाणामपि पिण्डानां श्रुत्वा भगवतो गतिम्॥ देवदूतेन यः पृष्टः श्राद्धस्य विधिनिश्चयः।<br />Having heard from the holy Vyasa what the end is of the three riceballs offered at the Shraddha, as explained by the Pitris themselves in reply to the question of the celestial messenger, I shall explain the same to you. Do you hear, o king, what the conclusions are about the ordinances about the Shraddha.</p>
<p id='33'>गतिं त्रयाणां पिण्डानां शृणुष्वावहितो मम॥ अपो गच्छति यो ह्यत्र शशिनं ह्येष प्रीणयेत्।<br />Listen with attention, O Bharata, to me as I explain what the end is of the three rice balls. That rice ball which goes into water is considered as pleasing the deity of the Moon.</p>
<p id='34'>शशी प्रीणयते देवान् पितश्चैव महामते॥ भुङ्क्ते तु पत्नी यं चैषामनुज्ञाता तु मध्यमम्।<br />That deity being pleased, O you of great intelligence gratifies in return the other deities and the Pitris also with them. It has bean laid down that the second riceball should be eaten by the wife.</p>
<p id='35'>पुत्रकामाय पुत्रं तु प्रयच्छन्ति पितामहाः॥ पिण्डो दीयते तन्निबोध मे।<br />The Pitris, who always wish for progeny, bestow children on the woman of the house. Listen now to me as I tell you what becomes of the rice ball that is thrown into the burning fire.</p>
<p id='36'>पितरस्तेन तृष्यन्ति प्रीताः कामान् दिशन्ति च॥ एतत् ते कथितं सर्वे त्रिषु पिण्डेषु या गतिः।<br />With that ball the Pitris are pleased, and as the result thereof, grant the fruition of all desires to the person offering it. I have thus told you everything about the end of the three riceballs offered at the Shraddha and consigned to the three (viz. water, the spouse and the fire.)</p>
<p id='37'>ऋत्विग्यो यजमानस्य पितृत्वमनुगच्छति॥ हव्यवाहे तु यः तस्मिन्नहनि मन्यन्ते परिहार्ये हि मैथुनम्।<br />That Brahmana who becomes the priest at a Shraddha forins himself by that deed, the Pitri of the person performing ine Shraddha. Hence he should abstain that day from sexual intercourse with even his own wife.</p>
<p id='38'>शुचिना तु सदा श्राद्धं भोक्तव्य खेचरोत्तम॥ ये मया कथिता दोषास्ते तथा स्युर्न चान्यथा।<br />O best of all rangers of the sky, the man who eats at a Shraddha should remain pure for that day. By acting otherwise one surely commits the sin I have indicated. It cannot be otherwise.</p>
<p id='39'>तस्मात् स्नातः शुचिः क्षान्तः श्राद्धंभुञ्जीत वै द्विजः।। प्रजा विवर्धते चास्य यश्चैवं सम्प्रयच्छति।<br />Hence, the Brahmana who is invited to a Shraddha for eating the offerings should eat them after purifying himself by a bath and remain pious for that day by abstaining form every kind of injury or evil. The progeny of such a person multiplies and he also who feeds him gets the same reward.</p>
<p id='40'>भीष्म उवाच ततो विद्युत्प्रभो नाम ऋषिराह महातपाः॥ आदित्यतेजसा तस्य तुल्यं रूपं प्रकाशते। स च धर्मरहस्यानि श्रुत्वा शक्रमथाब्रवीत्॥<br />Bhishma said After the Pitris had said so, a Rishi of austere penances, named Vidyutprabha, whose form was effulgent like the Sun spoke.</p>
<p id='41'>तिर्यग्योनिगतान् सत्त्वान् मा हिंसन्ति मोहिताः। कीटान् पिपीलिकान् सर्पान् मेषान् समृगपक्षिणः।। किल्बिषं सुबहु प्राप्ताः किंस्विदेषां प्रतिक्रिया। ततो देवगणाः सर्वे ऋषयश्च तपोधनाः॥<br />Having heard those mysteries of religion as explained by che Pitris, he addressed Shakra, saying, Stupefied by folly, men kill numerous creatures born in the intermediate orders, such as worms, ants, snakes, sheep, deer and birds. They commit a great sin by these acts. What, however, is the remedy?</p>
<p id='42'>पितरश्च महाभागाः पूजयन्ति स्म तं मुनिम्।<br />When this question was asked, all the gods and Rishis having penances for wealth and the highly blessed Pitris, praised that ascetic.</p>
<p id='43'>शक्र उवाच कुरुक्षेत्रं गयां गङ्गां प्रभासं पुष्कराणि च॥ एतानि मनसा ध्यात्वा अवगाहेत् ततो जलम्। तथा मुच्यति पापेन राहुणा चन्द्रमा यथा॥<br />Shakra said Thinking in one's mind of Kurukshetra and Gaya and Ganga and Prabhasa and the lakes of Pushkara, one should dip his head in a piece of water.</p>
<p id='44'>त्र्यहं स्नातंः स भवति निराहारश्च वर्तते। स्पृशते यो गवां पृष्ठं बालधिं च नमस्यति॥<br />By so doing he becomes purged off of all his sins like the Moon freed from Rahu. He should thus bathe for three days successively and then fast for every day.</p>
<p id='45'>ततो विद्युत्प्रभो वाक्यमभ्यभाषत वासवम्। अयं सूक्ष्मतरो धर्मस्तं निबोध शतक्रतो॥<br />Besides this, he should touch (After bathing) the back of a cow and bow his head to her tail. Vidutprabha, after this, once more addressing Vasava said, I shall describe a rite that is more subtle. Listen to me, O you of a hundred sacrifices.</p>
<p id='46'>घृष्टो वटकषायेण अनुलिप्तः प्रियंगुणा। क्षीरेण षष्टिकान् भुक्त्वा सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यते॥<br />Rubbed with the astringent powder of the hanging roots of the banian and anointed with the oil of Priyangu, one should eat the Shashtika paddy mixed with milk. By so doing he becomes purged off all his sins.</p>
<p id='47'>श्रूयतां चापरं गृह्यं रहस्यमृषिचिन्तितम्। श्रुतं मे भाषमाणस्य स्थाणोः स्थाने बृहस्पतेः॥<br />Listen now to another mystery unknown to many but which was discovered by the Rishis with the help of meditation. I heard it from Brihaspati while he recited it before Mahadeva.</p>
<p id='48'>रुद्रेण सह देवेश तन्निबोध शचीपते। पर्वतारोहणं कृत्वा एकपादो विभावसुम्॥ निरीक्षेत निराहार उर्ध्वबाहुः कृताञ्जलिः। तपसा महता युक्त उपवासफलं लभेत्॥<br />O king of the celestials do you hear it with Rudra in your company, O lord of Shachi. If a person, ascending a mountain stands there on one foot, with arms upraised and joined together and abstaining from food, looks at a burning fire, he acquires the merits of severe penances and obtains the rewards of fasts.</p>
<p id='49'>रश्मिभिस्तापितोऽर्कस्य सर्वपापमपोहति। ग्रीष्मकालेऽथ वा शीते एवं पापमपोहति॥<br />Heated by the rays of the Sun, he becomes purged off all his sins. One who acts thus in both the summer and the winter seasons becomes freed from every sin.</p>
<p id='50'>ततः पापत् प्रमुक्तस्य द्युतिर्भवति शाश्वती। तेजसा सूर्यवद् दीप्तो भ्राजते सोमवत् पुनः॥<br />Purged off of every sin one acquires a splendour of complexion for all time. Such a man burns with energy like the Sun or shines in beauty like the Moon.</p>
<p id='51'>मध्ये त्रिदशवर्गस्य देवराजः शतक्रतुः। उवाच मधुरं वाक्यं बृहस्पतिमनुत्तमम्॥<br />After this, the king of the celestials viz., he of a hundred sacrifices, seated in the midst of the gods then sweetly addressed Brihaspati, with these excellent words:</p>
<p id='52'>धर्मगुह्यं तु भगवन् मानुषाणां सुखावहम्। सरहस्याश्च ये दोषास्तान् यथावदुदीरय॥<br />O Holy One, do you describe those mysteries of religion which are fraught with happiness to human beings, and what the faults are which they commit, together with the mysteries of them.</p>
<p id='53'>बृहस्पति रुवाच प्रतिमेहन्ति ये सूर्यमनिलं द्विषते च ये। हव्यवाहे प्रदीप्ते च समिधं ये न जुह्वति॥ बालवत्सां च ये धेनुं दुहन्ति क्षीरकारणात्। तेषां दोषान् प्रवक्ष्यामि तान् निबोध शचीपते॥<br />Brihaspati said They who pass urine, facing the sun, they who do not show respect for the wind, they who do not pour libations on the burning fire, they who milk a cow whose calf is very young, actuated by the desire of obtaining from her as much milk as possible, commit many sins. I shall describe what those faults are, O lord of Shachi, Do you hear me.</p>
<p id='54'>भानुमाननिलश्चैव हव्यवाहश्च वासव। लोकानां मातरश्चैव गावः सृष्टाः स्वयम्भुवा॥ लोकांस्तारयितुं शक्ता मत्र्येष्वेतेषु देवताः। सर्वे भवन्तः शृण्वन्तु एकैकं धर्मनिश्चयम्॥<br />The Sun, Wind, the carrier of sacrificial oblations, O Vasava, and kine who are the mothers of all creatures, were created by the self-create himself, for rescuing all the worlds, O Shakra. These are the deities of human beings. Listen all the conclusions of religion.</p>
<p id='55'>वर्षाणि षडशीति तु दुर्वत्ताः कुलपांसनाः। स्त्रियः सर्वाश्च दुर्वृत्ता:प्रतिमेहन्ति या रविम्॥<br />Those wicked men and wicked women who pass urine facing the Sun, live in great infamy for eighty six years.</p>
<p id='56'>अनिलद्वेषिणः शक्र गर्भस्था च्यवते प्रजा। हव्यवाहस्य दीप्तस्य समिधं ये न जुह्वति।॥<br />That man, O Shakra, who cherishes no respect for the wind, gets children that come out prematurely from the womb of his wife. These men who do not pour libations on the burning fire, find that the fire, when they do light it up for such rites as they wish to perform refuses to eat their libations.</p>
<p id='57'>अग्निकार्येषु वै तेषां हव्यं नाश्नाति पावकः। क्षीरं तु बालवत्सानां ये पिबन्तीह मानवाः॥<br />Those men who drink the milk of kire whose calves are very young, never get children for perpetuating their races.</p>
<p id='58'>न तेषां क्षीरपाः केचिज्जायन्ते कुलवर्धनाः। प्रजाक्षयेण युज्यन्ते कुलवंशक्षयेण च॥<br />Such men see their children die and their families shrink. These are consequences of the acts referred to as observed by twice born persons, venerable for age in their respective families.</p>
<p id='59'>एवमेतत् पुरा दृष्टं कुलवृद्धौर्द्विजातिभिः। तस्माद् वानि वानि कार्यं कार्यं च नित्यशः।।<br />Hence, one should always avoid that which has been interdicted and do only that which has been directed to be done, if one is desirous of securing his prosperity. This that I say to you is very true.</p>
<p id='60'>भूतिकामेन म]न सत्यमेतद् ब्रवीमि ते। ततः सर्वा महाभाग देवताः समरुद्गणाः॥ ऋषयश्च महाभागाः पृच्छन्ति स्म पितूंस्ततः। पितरः केन तुष्यन्ति मर्त्यानामल्पचेतसाम्॥ अक्षयं च कथं दानं भवेच्चैवोर्ध्वदेहिकम्।<br />After the celestial preceptor had said this the highly blessed celestials, with the Maruts, and the highly blessed Rishis questioned the departed Manes saying, You Pitris with what acts of human beings, who are generally gifted with little understandings, do you become pleased? What gifts made in course of such rites as are performed for improving the position of deceased persons in the other world become inexhaustible in efficacy?</p>
<p id='61'>आनृण्यं वा कथं मा गच्छेयुः केन कर्मणा॥ एतदिच्छामहे श्रोतुं परं कौतूहलं हि नः।<br />By doing what acts can men become freed from the debt they owe to their ancestors? We wish to hear this. Great is our curiosity.</p>
<p id='62'>पितर ऊचुः न्यायतो वै महाभागाः संशयः समुदाहृतः॥ श्रूयतां येन तुष्यामो मानां साधुकर्मणाम्।<br />The Pitris said Yoy highly blessed ones, the doubt existing in your minds has been properly explained. Listen as we describe the deeds of righteous men with which we become pleased.</p>
<p id='63'>नीलपण्डप्रमोक्षेण अमावास्यां तिलोदकैः :॥ वर्षासु दीपकैश्चैव पितॄणामनृणो भवेत्।<br />Blue hued bulls should be liberated. Gifts should be made to us, on the day of the new moon of sesame seeds and water. In the season of rains, lamps should be lighted. By these decds of men they can free themselves from the debt they owe to their ancestors.</p>
<p id='64'>अक्षयं निळलीकं च दानमेतन्महाफलम्॥ अस्माकं परितोषश्च अक्षयः परिकीर्त्यते।<br />Such gifts never become vain. On the other hand they yield great and endless fruits. The gratification we derive from them is considered to be inexhaustible.</p>
<p id='65'>श्रद्दधानाश्च ये मर्त्या आहरिष्यन्ति संततिम्॥ दुर्गात् ते तारयिष्यन्ति नरकात् प्रपितामहान्।<br />Those men who gifted with faith, beget offspring, rescue their deceased ancestors from imiserable Hell.</p>
<p id='66'>पितॄणां भाषितं श्रुत्वा हृष्टरोमा तपोधनः॥ वृद्धगार्यो महातेजास्तानेवं वाक्यमब्रवीत्। के गुणा नीलपण्डस्य प्रमुक्तस्य तपोधनाः॥ वर्षासु दीपदानेन तथैव च तिलोदकैः।<br />Hearing these words of the Pitris, Vriddha Gargya, endued with penances and high energy, became filled with wonder so that the hair on his body stood erect. Addressing them he said, Ye having penances for wealth, tell us what the merits are of setting free Bulls having blue complexions. What merits, again, are of the gifts of lamps in the season of rains and the gift of water with sesame seeds?</p>
<p id='67'>पितर ऊचुः नीलषण्डस्य लाङ्गुलं तोयमभ्युद्धरेद् यदि॥ षष्टिं वर्षसहस्राणि पितरस्तेन तर्पिता:।<br />The Pitris said If a bull of blue complexion upon being liberated raises a (small) quantity of water with its tail the Pitris become pleased with that water for full sixty thousand years.</p>
<p id='68'>यस्तु शृङ्गगतं पदं कूलादूद्धृत्य तिष्ठति।॥ पितरस्तेन गच्छन्ति सोमलोकमसंशयम्।<br />The mud such a bull raises with its horns from the banks (of a river or lake) succeeds, forsooth, in sending the Pitris to the region of Soma.</p>
<p id='69'>वर्षासु दीपदानेन शशिवच्छोभते नरः॥ तमोरूपं न तस्यास्ति दीपकं यः प्रयच्छति।<br />By giving lamps in the season of rains one shines with effulgence like Soma himself. The man who gives lamps is never subject to the quality of Darkness.</p>
<p id='70'>अमावास्यां तु ये माः प्रयच्छन्ति तिलोदकम्॥ पात्रमौदुम्बरं गृह्य मधुमिश्रं तपोधन। कृतं भवति तैः श्राद्धं सरहस्यं यथार्थवत्॥ हृष्टपुष्टमनास्तेषां प्रजा भवति नित्यदा।<br />Those men who make gifts on the day of the new moon of sesame seeds and water, mixed with honey and using a vessel of copper, O you having penances for wealth, are considered as duly performing a Shraddha with all its mysteries. These men get children of sound health and cheerful minds.</p>
<p id='71'>कुलवंशस्य वृद्धिस्तु पिण्डदस्य फलं भवेत्। श्रद्दधानस्तु यः कुर्यात् पितॄणामनृणो भवेत्॥<br />The merit acquired by the giver of the Pinda takes the forin of the growth of his family. Indeed, he who performs these acts with faith, becomes freed from the debt he owes to the ancestors.</p>
<p id='72'>एवमेव समुद्विष्टः श्राद्धकालक्रमस्तथा। विधिः पात्रं फलं चैव यथावदनुकीर्तिमम्॥<br />Thus have been laid down the proper time for the performance of the Shraddha, the ordinances about the rites to be observed the proper person that should be fed at the Shraddha, and the merits that belong to it. I have described everything to you in due orders.</p>
