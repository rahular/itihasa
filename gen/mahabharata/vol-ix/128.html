<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 128</h3><h4>The observance of duties which produces happiness</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>वायु रुवाच किंचिद् धर्मं प्रवक्ष्यामि मानुषाणां सुखावहम्। सरहस्याश्च ये दोषास्ताशृणुध्वं समाहिताः॥<br />Vayu said I shall recite some duties the observance of which produces happiness to mankind. Do you listen also with rapt attention, to certain transgressions upon which they depend.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>अग्निकार्यं च कर्तव्यं परमान्नेन भोजनम्। दीपकश्चापि कर्तव्यः पितॄणां सतिलोदकः॥ एतेन विधिना मर्त्यः श्रद्दधानः समाहितः। चतुरो वार्षिकान् मासान् यो ददाति तिलोदकम्॥ भोजनं च यथाशक्त्या ब्राह्मणे वेदपारगे। पशुबधशतस्येह फलं प्राप्नोति पुष्कलम्॥<br />That man who offers for the four months of the rainy season sesame and water (to the Pitris) and food, according to the best of his power to a Brahmana thoroughly expert in duties, who duly pours libations on the sacred fire, and makes offerings of rice boiled in sugared milk, who gives lamps in honor of the ancestors, with sesame and water, indeed he who does all this with faith and rapt attention, acquires all the merits of a hundred sacrifices in which animals are offered up to the celestials.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>इदं चैवापरं गुह्यमप्रशस्तं निबोधत। अग्नेस्तु वृषलो नेता हविर्मूढाश्च योषितः॥ मन्यते धर्म एवेति स चाधर्मेण लिप्यते।<br />Listen to this other great mystery that is unknown to all. That man who thinks it all right when a Shudra lights up the fire upon which he is to pour libations or who does not see any fault when women who are incompetent to assist at Shraddhas and other rites are allowed to assist at them, commit a sin,</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>अग्नयस्तस्य कुप्यन्ति शूद्रयोनि स गच्छति॥ पितरश्च न तुष्यन्ति सह देवैर्विशेषतः।<br />The three sacrificial fires become enraged with such a person. In his next life he is born as a Shudra. His departed manes, together with the celestials are never pleased with him.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>प्रायश्चित्तं तु यत् तत्र ब्रुवतस्तन्निबोध मे॥ यत् कृत्वा तु नरः सम्यक् सुखी भवति विज्वरः।<br />I shall now recite what the expiation's are which one must perform for purifying himself from such sins. Listen to me with attention. By performing those expiatory rites, one becomes happy and free from fever.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>गवां मूत्रपुरीषेण पयसा च घृतेन च॥ अग्निकार्यं त्र्यहं कुर्यात्रिराहारः समाहितः।<br />Fasting all the while one should, for three days, with rapt attention pour libations, on the sacred fire, of the urine of the cow mixed with cowdung and milk and clarified butter.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>ततः संवत्सरे पूर्णे प्रतिगह्णन्ति देवताः॥ हृष्यन्ति पितरश्चास्य श्राद्धकाल उपस्थिते।<br />The celestials accept the offerings of such a man on the expiration of a full year. His departed Manes also, when the time comes for him for performing the Shraddha, become pleased with him.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>एष ह्यधर्मो धर्मश्च सरहस्यः प्रकीर्तितः॥ मानां स्वर्गकामानां प्रेत्य स्वर्गसुखावहः॥<br />I have thus recited what is righteous and what unrighteous, with all their unknown details, about human beings desirous of attaining to Heaven. Men who abstain from these sins or who having committed them perform the expiatory rites pointed out, succeed in attaining to the celestial region when they leave this world.</p>
