<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 93</h3><h4>Whether a Brahmana eating Havya at the invitation of a Brahmana, while fasting, commits sin</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच द्विजातयो व्रतोपेता हविस्ते यदि भुजते। अन्नं ब्राह्मणकामाय कथमेतत् पितामह॥<br />Yudhishthira said If Brahmanas who observe a vow (viz., fast) eat, at the invitation of a Brahmana, the Havi, can they be charged with the sin of violating their vow? Tell me this, O Grandfather.</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच अवदोक्तव्रताश्चैव भुजानाः कामकारणे। वेदोक्तेषु तु भुजाना व्रतलुप्ता युधिष्ठिर॥<br />Bhishma said Let those Brahmanas eat, moved by desire, who observe such vows as are not laid down in the Vedas. About those Brahmanas, however, who observe such vows as are laid down in the Vedas, they are considered as guilty of a breach of their vow, O Yudhishthira, by eating the Havi of Shraddha at the request of him who performs the Shraddha.</p>
<p id='3'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच यदिदं तप इत्याहुरुपवासं पृथग्जनाः। तपः स्यादेतदेवेह तपोऽन्यद् वापि किं भवेत्॥<br />Yudhishthira said Some people say that fast is a penance. Is penance really at one with fast or is it not so? Tell me this, O grandfather.</p>
<p id='4'>भीष्म उवाच मासार्धमासोपवासाद् यत् तपो मन्यते जनः। आत्मतन्त्रोपघाती यो न तपस्वी न धर्मवित्॥<br />Bhishma said People do consider a regular fast for a month or a half month as a penance. The truth, however, is that one who mortifies his own body is not to be considered, either as an ascetic or as one conversant with duty.</p>
<p id='5'>त्यागस्य चापि सम्पत्तिः शिष्यते तप उत्तमम्। सदोपवासी च भवेद् ब्रह्मचारी तथैव च।॥<br />Renunciation, however, is considered as the best of penances. A Brahmana should always abstain from food, and observe the vow of celibacy.</p>
<p id='6'>मुनिश्च स्यात् सदा विप्रो वेदांश्चैव सदा जपेत्। कुटुम्बिको धर्मकामः सदास्वप्नश्च मानवः॥<br />A Brahmana should always practise self denial controlling even speech, and recite the marry and Vedas. The Brahmana should surround himself with children and relatives, from desire of acquiring virtue. He should never sleep.</p>
<p id='7'>अमांशशी सदा च स्यात् पवित्रं च सदा पठेत् ऋतवादी सदा च स्यान्नियतश्च सदा भवेत्॥<br />He should abstain from meat. He should always read the Vedas and the scriptures. He should always speak the truth, and practise selfcontrol.</p>
<p id='8'>विघसाशी कथं च स्यात् सदा चैवातिथिप्रियः। अमृताशी सदा च स्यात् पवित्री च सदा भवेत्॥<br />He should eat the residue, (viz., of what remains after serving the deities and guests). Indeed, he should be hospitable towards all that come should be hospitable towards all that come to his house. He should always eat nectar, He should duly observe all rites and celebrate sacrifices.</p>
<p id='9'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच कथं सदोपवासी स्याद् ब्रह्मचारी च पार्थिव। विघसाशी कथं न स्यात् कथं चैवातिथिप्रियः॥<br />Yuthishthira said How may one come to be considered as always observant of fasts? How may one become observant of vows? How, O king, may one come to be an eater of the residue? By doing what may one be said to be fond of guests.</p>
<p id='10'>भीष्म उवाच अन्तरा सायमाशं च प्रातराशं च यो नरः। सदोपवासी भवति यो न भुङ्क्तेऽन्तरा पुनः॥<br />Bhishma said He who takes food only morning and evening at the appointed hours and abstains from all food during the interval, is said to be an abstainer from food.</p>
<p id='11'>भार्यां गच्छन् ब्रह्मचारी ऋतौ भवति चैव ह। ऋतवादी सदा च स्याद् दानशीलस्तु मानवः॥<br />He who knows only his married wife and that only at her season, is said to be observant of the vow of celibacy. By always making gifts, one comes to be considered as truthful in speech,</p>
<p id='12'>अभक्षयन् वृथा मांसममांसाशी भवत्युत। दानं ददत् पवित्री स्यादस्वप्नश्च दिवास्वपन्॥<br />By abstaining from all meat obtained from animals killed for nothing, one becomes an abstainer from meat. By making gifts one becomes purged of all sins, and by abstaining from sleep during day time, one comes to be considered always awake,</p>
<p id='13'>भृत्यातिथिषु यो भुङ्क्ते भुक्तवत्सु नरः सदा। अमृतं केवलं भुङ्क्ते इति विद्धि युधिष्ठिर॥<br />He who always eats what remains after serving the guests and servants, know, O Yuthishthira, is said to always eat nectar.</p>
<p id='14'>अभुक्तवत्सु नाश्नाति ब्राह्मणेषु तु यो नरः। अभोजनेन तेनास्य जितः स्वर्गो भवत्युत॥<br />He who abstains from eating till Brahmanas have eaten, is considered considered as conquering Heaven by such abstention.</p>
<p id='15'>देवेभ्यश्च पितृभ्यश्च संथितेभ्यस्तथैव च। अवशिष्टानि यो भुङ्क्ते तमाहुर्विघसाशिनम्॥<br />He who eats what remains after serving the celestials, the departed Manes, and relatives and dependants, is said to eat Vighasa or the residue.</p>
<p id='16'>तेषां लोका हापर्यन्ताः सदने ब्रह्मणः स्मृताः। उपस्थिता ह्यप्सरसो गन्धर्वेश्च जनाधिप॥<br />Such man acquire many regions of happiness in the abode of Brahman himself, There, o king, they live in the company of Apsaras and Gandharvas.</p>
<p id='17'>देवतातिथिभिः सार्धं पितृभ्यश्चोपभुञ्जते। रमन्ते पुत्रपौत्रेण तेषां गतिरनुत्तमा॥<br />Indeed, they sport and enjoy in these regions, with the celestials and guests and the departed Manes in their company, and surrounded by their children and grandchildren. Even such becomes their high end. own</p>
<p id='18'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच ब्राह्मणेभ्यः प्रयच्छन्ति दानानि विविधानि च। दातृप्रतिग्रहीत्रोर्वै को विशेषः पितामह॥<br />Yuthishthira said People are seen to make various kinds of gifts to the Brahmanas. What, however, is the difference, O grandfather, between the giver and the receiver?</p>
<p id='19'>भीष्म उवाच साधोर्यः प्रतिगृह्णीयात् तथैवासाधुतो द्विजः। गुणवत्यल्पदोष: स्यान्निर्गुणे तु निमज्जति॥<br />Bhishma said The Brahmana accepts gifts from him who is righteous, and from him who is sinful. If the giver happens to be virtuous, the receiver commits little sin. If, on the other hand, the giver happens to be impious, the receiver sinks in hell.</p>
<p id='20'>अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। वृषादर्भश्च संवादं सप्तर्षीणां च भारत॥<br />Regarding it is cited an old history of the conversation between Vrishadarbhi and the seven Rishis, O Bharata.</p>
<p id='21'>कश्यपोऽत्रिर्वसिष्ठश्च भरद्वाजोऽथ गौतमः। विश्वामित्रो जगदग्निः साध्वी चैवाप्यरुन्धती॥ सर्वेषामथ तेषां तु गण्डाभूत् कर्मकारिका। शूद्रः पशुसखश्चैव भर्ता चास्या बभूव ह॥<br />Kashyapa, Atri, Vashishtha, Bharadvaja, Gautama, Visvamitra, Jamadagni, and chaste Arundhati (the wife of Vashishtha), all had a common maidservant whose name was Ganda. A Shudra named Pashusakha married Ganda and became her husband.</p>
<p id='22'>ते च सर्वे तपस्यन्तः पुरा चेहर्महीमिमाम्। समाधिनोपशिक्षन्तो ब्रह्मलोकं सनातनम्॥<br />Kashyapa and others, formerly, observed the austeresi penances and roved over the world, desirous of acquiring the eternal region of Brahman by the help of Yogameditation.</p>
<p id='23'>अथाभवदनावृष्टिर्महती कुरुनन्दन। कृच्छ्रप्राणोऽभवद् यत्र लोकोऽयं वै क्षुधान्वितः॥<br />About that time, O delighter of the Kurus, there took place a severe drought. Stricken with hunger, the whole world of living creiures become greatly weak.</p>
<p id='24'>कस्मिंश्चिच्च पुरा शैब्येन शिबिसूनुना। दक्षिणार्थेऽथ ऋत्विग्भ्यो दत्तः पुत्रः पुरा किल॥<br />At a sacrifice which had been performed formerly by Shibi's son, he had given away to the Ritviks a son of his as the sacrificial present.</p>
<p id='25'>अस्मिन् कालेऽथ सोऽल्पायुर्दिष्टान्तमगमत् प्रभुः। ते तं क्षुधाभिसंतप्ताः परिवार्योपतस्थिरे॥<br />About this time, longlived as the prince was, he died of starvation. The Rishis named, afflicted with hunger, approached the dead prince and sat encircling him.</p>
<p id='26'>प्रतिग्रहस्तारयति पुष्टिवै प्रतिगृह्यताम्। मयि यद् विद्यते वित्तं तद् वृणुध्वं तपोधनाः॥<br />The acceptance of a gift will immediately relieve you all. Do you, therefore, accept a gift for the maintenance of your bodies! you ascetics having penances for wealth, listen to me as I declare what wealth I have.</p>
<p id='27'>प्रियो हि मे ब्राह्मणो याचमानो दद्यामहं वोऽश्वतरीसहस्रम्। एकैकशः सवृषाः सम्प्रसूताः सर्वेषां वै शीघ्रगाः श्वेतरोमाः॥<br />That Brahmana who solicits me is ever dear to me. Indeed I shall give you a thousand kine of white hair, foremost in speed, each accompanied by a bull, and each having a wellborn calf, and, therefore, giving milk.</p>

I shall also give you a large number of kine, of good nature, the foremost of their kind, all fat, and each of which, having brought forth her first calf, is quick with her second.</p>
<p id='29'>वृषदर्भ पुत्र उवाच वरान् ग्रामान् ब्रीहिरसं यवांश्च रत्नं चान्यद् दुर्लभं किं ददानि। नास्मिन्नभक्ष्ये भावमेवं कुरुध्वं पुष्ट्यर्थं वः किं प्रयच्छाम्यहं वै॥<br />The son of Vrishadarbha said Tell me what else I shall give of foremost villages, of grain, of barley, and of even the rarer and more precious jewels. Do not seek to eat this food that is inedible. Tell me what should I give you for the maintenance of your bodies.</p>
<p id='30'>ऋषय ऊचुः राजन् प्रतिग्रहो राज्ञां मध्वास्वादो विषोपमः। तज्जानमानः कस्मात् त्वं कुरुषे नः प्रलोभनम्॥<br />The Rishis said O king, to accept gifts from a monarch is very sweet at first but it is poison in the end. Knowing this well, why do you, O king, tempt us then with these offers?</p>
<p id='31'>क्षेत्रं हि दैवतमिदं ब्राह्मणान् समुपाश्रितम्। अमलो ह्येष तपसा प्रीतः प्रीणाति देवताः॥<br />The body of the Brahmana is the divine field. By penance, it is purified. Then again, by pleasing the Brahmana, one pleases the celestials.</p>
<p id='32'>अह्रापहि तपो जातु ब्राह्मणस्योपजायते। तद् दाव इव निर्दह्यात् प्राप्तो राजप्रतिग्रहः॥<br />If a Brahmana accepts the gifts made to him by the king, he loses, by such acceptance, the merit that he would otherwise win by a his penances, they day. Indeed, such acceptance destroys that merit as a burning fire destroys a wilderness.</p>
<p id='33'>कुशलं सह दानेन राजन्नस्तु सदा तवा अर्थिभ्यो दीयतां सर्वमित्युक्त्वान्येन ते ययुः॥<br />May you be happy, O king, as the result of the gifts you make to those who solicit you. Saying these words to them, they left that place, proceeding by another way,</p>
<p id='34'>ततः प्रचोदिता राज्ञा वनं गत्वास्य मन्त्रिणः। प्रचीयोदुम्बराणि स्म दातुं तेषां प्रचक्रिरे॥<br />After this, urged by their master, the ministers of the king, entered those woods and plucking certain figs tried to give them away to those Rishis.</p>
<p id='35'>उदुम्बराण्यथान्यानि हेमगर्भाण्युपाहरन्। भृत्यास्तेषां ततस्तानि प्रग्रहितमुपाद्रवन्॥<br />The offers of king filled some of those figs with gold and mixing them with others tried to induce those ascetics to accept thein.</p>
<p id='36'>गुरूणीति विदित्वाथ न ग्राह्याण्यत्रिरब्रवीत्। न स्महे मन्दविज्ञाना न स्महे मन्दबुद्धयः॥<br />Atri took up some of those figs, and finding them heavy refused to take them. He said, We are not shorn of knowledge. We are not fools.</p>
<p id='37'>हैमानीमानि जानीमः प्रतिबुद्धाः स्म जागृम। इह ह्येतदुपादत्तं प्रेत्य स्यात् कटुकोदयम्। अप्रतिग्राह्यमेवैतत् प्रेत्येह च सुखेप्सुना।॥<br />We know that there is gold within these figs. We have our senses about us. Indeed, we are awake instead of being asleep. If accepted in this world, those will yield bitter results hereafter. He who seeks happiness both in this world and in the next, should never accept these.</p>
<p id='38'>वसिष्ठ उवाच शतेन निष्कगणितं सहस्रेण च सम्मितम्। तथा बहु प्रतीच्छन् वै पापिष्ठां पतते गतिम्॥<br />Vasishtha said If we accept even one gold coin, it will be counted as a hundred or even a thousand. If, therefor, we accept many coins, we shall surely attain to an unhappy end in the next world.</p>
<p id='39'>कश्यप उवाच यत्पृथिव्यां व्रीहियवं हिरण्यं पशवः स्त्रियः। सर्वं तन्नालमेकस्य तस्माद् विद्वाञ्छमं चरेत्॥<br />Kashyapa said All the paddy and barley on Earth, all the gold and animals and women that are in the world, are incapable of satisfying the desire of a single person. Hence, a wise man should, removing cupidity, adopt tranquillity.</p>
<p id='40'>भरद्वाज उवाच उत्पन्नस्य रुरोः शृङ्गं वर्धमानस्य वर्धते। प्रार्थना पुरुषस्येव तस्य मात्रा न विद्यते॥<br />Bharadvaja said The horns of a Ruru, when they first appear, begin to grow with the growth of the animal. The cupidity of man is like this. It has no limit.</p>

I think, however, that the acquisition of virtue is better than that of riches.</p>

That wealth is known to the Brahmanas. I wait upon them as their servant, only for learning to prize that wealth.</p>

<p id='50'>भीष्म उवाच इत्युक्तः स तु भृत्यैस्तैर्वृषादर्भिश्चुकोप ह। तेषां वै प्रतिकर्तुं च सर्वेषामगमद् गृहम्॥<br />Bhishma said Thus addressed by his ministers, king Vrishadarbhi became stricken with anger against all those Rishis. Indeed, to take vengeance upon them, the king entered his own apartment.</p>
<p id='51'>स गत्वा हवनीयेऽग्नौ तीव्र नियममास्थितः। जुहाव संस्कृतैर्मन्त्रैरेकैकामाहुतिं नृपः॥<br />Practising the austerest of penances, he poured on his sacred fire libations of clarified butter, accompanying each with Mantras uttered by him.</p>
<p id='52'>तस्मादग्नेः समुत्तस्थौ कृत्या लोकभयंकरी। तस्या नाम वृषादर्भिर्यातुधानीत्यथाकरोत्॥<br />From that fire there then originated, as the outcome of the incantation, a form capable of striking every one with fear. Vrishadarbhi named her as Yatudhani.</p>
<p id='53'>सा कृत्या कालरात्रीव कृताञ्जलिरुपस्थिता। वृषादी नरपतिं किं करोमाति चाब्रवीत्॥<br />That form which had originated from the incantations of the king, loO king as dreadful as the Last Night, appeared with joined hands before the king. Addressing king Vrishadarbhi, she said, What shall I do?</p>
<p id='54'>वृषदर्भी उवाच ऋषीणां गच्छ सप्तनामरुन्धत्यास्तथैव च। दासीभर्तुश्च दास्याश्च मनसा नाम धारय॥<br />Vrishadarbhi said Go and follow the seven Rishis, as also Arundhati, and the husband of their maidservant, and the maid-servant herself, and understand what the meanings are of their names.</p>
<p id='55'>ज्ञात्वा नामानि चैवैषां सर्वानेतान् विनाशय। विनष्टेषु तथा स्वैरं गच्छ यत्रेप्सितं तव॥<br />Having learnt their names, do you kill all of them. After killing them you may go wherever you like.</p>

<p id='57'>अथात्रिप्रमुखा राजन् वने तस्मिन् महर्षयः। व्यचरन् भक्षयन्तो वै मूलानि च फलानि च॥<br />Indeed, O king, those great Rishis, with Atri among them, roamed within the forest, living upon fruits and roots.</p>
<p id='58'>अथापश्यन् सुपीनांसपाणिपादमुखोदरम्। परिव्रजन्तं स्थूलाङ्गं परिव्राजं शुना सह॥<br />In course of their travel they saw a mendicant of broad shoulders, and plump arms and legs and wellgrown face and abdomen. Of limbs that were all adipose, he was travelling with a dog in his company.</p>

It is therefore that we see both him and his dog so well-formed.</p>
<p id='61'>अत्रिरुवाच नैतस्येह यथास्माकं क्षुधा वीर्यं समाहतम्। कृच्छ्राधीतं प्रनष्टं च तेन पीवाञ्छना सह॥<br />Atri said This man does not like us, feel the sufferings of hunger. His energy has not suffered, like ours, any decrease. Acquired with the greatest difficulty, his Vedas have not, like ours disappeared. Hence it is that we see both him and his dog so wellgrown.</p>
