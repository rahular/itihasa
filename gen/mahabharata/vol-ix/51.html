<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 51</h3><h4>The nature of compassion and pity. The discourse between Nahusha and Chyavana</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच नहुषस्तु ततः श्रुत्वा च्यवनं तं तथागतम्। वरितः प्रययौ तत्र सहामात्यपुरोहितः॥<br />Bhishma said Hearing the strait into which Chyavana was reduced, King Nahusha speedily went there, accompanied by his ministers and priest.</p>
<p id='2'>शौचं कृत्वा यथान्यायं प्राञ्जलिः प्रयतो नृपः। आत्मानमाचचक्षे च च्यवनाय महात्मने॥<br />Having purified himself duly, the king, with joined hands and rapt attention, introduced himself to the great Chyavana.</p>
<p id='3'>अर्चयामास तं चापि तस्य राज्ञः पुरोहितः। सत्यव्रतं महात्मानं देवकल्पं विशाम्पते॥<br />The king's priest then adored with due ceremonies that Rishi, O king, who was observant of the vow of truth and gifted with a great soul, and who resembled a god himself.</p>
<p id='4'>नहुष उवाच करवाणि प्रियं किं ते तन्मे ब्रूहि द्विजोत्तम। सर्वं कर्तास्मि भगवान् यद्यपि स्यात् सुदुष्करम्॥<br />Nahusha said Tell, me, O best of twiceborn ones, what act shall we do that may be pleasing to you? However difficult that deed may be, there is nothing, O holy one, that I shall not be able to do at your command.</p>
<p id='5'>च्यवन उवाच श्रमेण महता युक्ताः कैवर्ता मत्स्यजीविनः। मम मूल्यं प्रयच्छेभ्यो मत्स्यानां विक्रयैः सह॥<br />Chyavana said These men who live by catching fish, have all been exhausted with fatigue. Do you pay them the price that may be fixed upon me along with value of these fish.</p>
<p id='6'>हुष उवाच सहस्रं दीयतां मूल्यं निषादेभ्यः पुरोहित। निष्क्रयार्थे भगवतो यथाऽऽह भृगुनन्दनः॥<br />Nahusha said Let my priest give to these Nishadas a thousand coins as price for buying this sacred one as he himself has ordered.</p>
<p id='7'>च्यवन उवाच सहस्रं नाहमर्हामि किं वा त्वं मन्यसे नृप। सदृशं दीयतां मूल्यं स्वबुद्ध्या निश्चयं कुरु॥<br />Chyavana said A thousand coins is not my price. The question depends upon your discretion. Give them a fair price, setting with your discretion. Give them a fair price, settling with your own intelligence what it should be.</p>
<p id='8'>नहुष उवाच सहस्राणां शतं विप्र निषादेभ्यः प्रदीयताम्। स्यादिदं भगवन् मूल्यं किं वान्यन्मन्यते भवान्॥<br />Nahusha said Let, О learned Brahmana, a hundred thousand coins be given to these Nishadas. Shall this be your price, O holy one, or do you think otherwise.</p>
<p id='9'>च्यवन उवाच नाहं शतसहस्रेण निमेयः पार्थिवर्षभ। दीयतां सदृशं मूल्यममात्यैः सह चिन्तय॥<br />Chyavana said I should not be bought with a hundred thousand coins, O best of kings! Let a proper price be given to these! Do you consult with your ministers.</p>
<p id='10'>नहुष उवाच कोटिः प्रदीयतां मूल्यं निषादेभ्यः पुरोहित। यदेतदपि नो मूल्यमतो भूयः प्रदीयताम्॥<br />Nabusha said Let my priest give to these Nishadas a crore of coins. If even this does not cover your value, let more be paid to them.</p>
<p id='11'>च्यवन उवाच राजन् नार्हाम्यहं कोटि भूयो वापि महाद्युते। सदृशं दीयतां मूल्यं ब्राह्मणैः सह चिन्तय॥<br />Chyavana said O king, I am not with a crore of coins or even more. Let that price be given to these men which would be fair or proper. Do you consult with the Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='12'>नहुष उवाच अर्धं राज्यं समग्रं वा निषादेभ्यः प्रदीयताम्। एतन्मूल्यमहं मन्ये किं वान्यन्मन्यसे द्विज॥<br />Nahusha said Let half my kingdom or even the whole be given away to these Nishadas. I think that would be your price. What, however, do you think twiceborn one?</p>
<p id='13'>च्यवन उवाच अर्धं राज्यं समग्रं च मूल्यं नार्हामि पार्थिव। सदृशं दीयतां मूल्यमृषिभिः सह चिन्त्यताम्॥<br />Chyavana said I do not deserve to be purchased with half your kingdom or even the whole of it, O king! Let that price which is proper be given to these men. Do you consult with the Rishis!</p>
<p id='14'>भीष्म उवाच महर्षेर्वचनं श्रुत्वा नहुषो दुःखकर्शितः। स चिन्तयामास तदा सहामात्यपुरोहितः॥<br />Bhishma continued Hearing these words of the great Rishi, Nahusha became stricken with great sorrow. With his ministers and priest he began to think on the matter.</p>
<p id='15'>तत्र त्वन्यो वनचरः कश्चिन्मूलफलाशनः। नहुषस्य समीपस्थो गविजातोऽभवन्मुनिः॥<br />There then came to king Nahusha an ascetic living in the forest and subsisting upon fruit and roots and born of cow.</p>
<p id='16'>स तमाभाष्य राजानमब्रवीद् द्विजसत्तमः। तोषमिपम्यहं क्षिप्रं यथा तुष्टो भविष्यति॥<br />That best of twiceborn persons, addressing the king, O monarch, said these words-I shall soon satisfy you. The Rishi also will be satisfied.</p>
<p id='17'>नाहं मिथ्यावचो ब्रूयां स्वैरेष्वपि कुतोऽन्यथा। भवतो यदहं ब्रूयां तत्कार्यमविशङ्कया॥<br />I shall never speak a falsehood, no, not even in jest, what then need I say of other occasions? You should unhesitatingly do what I bid you.</p>
<p id='18'>नहुष उवाच ब्रवीतु भगवान् मूल्यं महर्षेः सदृशं भृगोः। परित्रायस्व मामस्मद्विषयं च कुलं च मे॥<br />Nahusha said Do you, O illustrious one, say what the value is of that great Rishi of Bhrigu's race. O, save me from this terrible difficulty, save my kingdom and save my family</p>
<p id='19'>हन्याद्धि भगवान् क्रुद्धस्त्रैलोक्यमपि केवलम्। किं पुनर्मां तपोहीनं बाहुवीर्यपरायणम्॥<br />If the holy Chyavana become angry, he would destroy the three worlds; what need I say then of my poor self who is destitute of penances and who depends upon the power only of his arms.</p>
<p id='20'>अगाधाम्भसि मग्नस्य सामात्यस्य सऋत्विजः। प्लवो भव महर्षे त्वं कुरु मूल्यविनिश्चयम्॥<br />O great Rishi, do you become the raft to us who have all fallen into a fathomless deep with all our counsellors and our priest. Do you settle what the value should be of the Rishi!</p>
<p id='21'>भीष्म उवाच गविजातः प्रतापवान्। नहुषस्य वचः श्रुत्वा उवाच हर्षयन् सर्वानमात्यान् पार्थिवं च तम्॥<br />Bhishma said Hearing these words of Nahusha, the ascetic born of a cow and gifted with great energy spoke thus, gladdening the monarch with all his counsellors:</p>
<p id='22'>अनया महाराज द्विजा वर्णेषु चोत्तमाः। गावश्च पुरुषव्याघ्र गौर्मूल्यं परिकल्प्यताम्॥<br />Brahmanas, O king, belong to the foremost of the four castes. No value, however great, can be fixed upon them. Kine also are invaluable. Therefore, O king, do you regard a cow as the value of the Rishi!</p>
<p id='23'>नहुषस्तु ततः श्रुत्वा महर्षेर्वचनं नृप। हर्षेण महता युक्तः सहामात्यपुरोहितः॥<br />Hearing these words of the great Rishi, Nahusha became, O king, filled with joy along with all his counsellors and priest.</p>
<p id='24'>अभिगम्य भृगोः पुत्रं च्यवनं संशितव्रतम्। इदं प्रोवाच नृपते वाचा संतर्पयन्निव॥<br />Proceeding then to Bhrigu's son Chyavana of rigid vows, he addressed him thus O monarch, for satisfying him to the best of his power.</p>
<p id='25'>नहुष उवाच उत्तिष्ठोत्तिष्ठ विप्रर्षे गवा क्रीतोऽसि भार्गव। एतन्मूल्यमहं मन्ये तव धर्मभृतां वर॥<br />Nahusha said Rise, rise, O twiceborn Rishi, you have been purchased, O son of Bhrigu, with a cow as your price! O foremost of righteous persons, even this, I think, is your price!</p>
<p id='26'>च्यवन उवाच उत्तिष्ठाम्येष राजेन्द्र सम्यक् क्रीतोऽस्मि तेऽनघ। गोभिस्तुल्यं न पश्यामि धनं किंचिदिहाच्युत॥<br />Chyavana said Yes, O king of kings, I do rise up. I have been properly purchased by you, O sinless ore. I do not, O you of unfading glory, see any riches that is equal to kine.</p>
<p id='27'>कीर्तनं श्रवणं दानं दर्शनं चापि पार्थिव। गवां प्रशस्यते वीर सर्वपापहरं शिवम्॥<br />To speak of kine, to hear others speak of then, to make gifts of kine, and to see kine, O king, are acts, that are all praised, O hero, and that are highly auspicious and purifying.</p>
<p id='28'>गावो लक्ष्म्याः सदा मूलं गोषु पाप्मा न विद्यते। अन्नमेव सदा गावो देवानां परमं हविः॥<br />Kine are always the root of prosperity. There is no fault in kine. Kine always give the best food, in the form of Havi, to the deities.</p>
<p id='29'>स्वाहाकारवषट्कारौ गोषु नित्यं प्रतिष्ठितौ। गावो यज्ञस्य नेत्र्यो वै तथा यज्ञस्य ता मुखम्॥<br />The sacred Mantras, Svaha and Vashat, are always established upon kine. Kine are the chief conductresses of Sacrifices. They form the mouth of Sacrifice.</p>
<p id='30'>अमृतं ह्यव्ययं दिव्यं क्षरन्ति च वहन्ति च। अमृतायतनं चैताः सर्वलोकनमस्कृताः॥<br />They bear and yield excellent and strength giving ambrosia. They receive the adoration of all the worlds and are considered as the source of nectar.</p>
<p id='31'>तेजसा वपुषा चैव गावो वह्निसमा भुवि। गावो हि सुमहत् तेजः प्राणिनां च सुखप्रदाः॥<br />On Earth, kine resemble fire in energy and form. Indeed, kine represent high energy, and are conferreres of great happiness upon all creatures.</p>
<p id='32'>निविष्टं गोकुलं यत्र श्वासं मुञ्चति निर्भयम्। विराजयति तं देशं पापं चास्यापकर्षति॥<br />That country where, kine placed by their owners, breathe fearlessly, shines in beauty. The sins also of that country are all removed.</p>
<p id='33'>गावः स्वर्गस्य सोपानं गावः स्वर्गेऽपि पूजिताः। गाव: कामदुहो देव्यो नान्यत् किंचित् परं स्मृतम्।।<br />Kine form the stairs leading to Heaven. Kine are worshipped in Heaven itself. Kine are goddesses that can give everything and grant every wish. There is nothing else in the world that is so high or so superior.</p>
<p id='34'>भीष्म उवाच इत्येतद् गोषु मे प्रोक्तं माहात्म्यं भरतर्षभ। गुणैकदेशवचनं शक्यं पारायणं न तु॥<br />Bhishma said This is what I say to you on the subject of the glory and superiority of kine, O chief of Bharata's race. I am competent to describe a part only of the merits of the kine. I have not the ability to exhaust the subject.</p>
<p id='35'>निषाद उवाच दर्शनं कथनं चैव सहास्माभिः कृतं मुने। सतां साप्तपदं मैत्रं प्रसादं नः कुरु प्रभो॥<br />The Nishadas said O ascetic, you have seen us and have also spoken with us, It has been said that friendship, with the good, depends upon only seven words. Do you then, O lord, show us your favour.</p>
<p id='36'>हवींषि सर्वाणि यथा [पभुङ्क्ते हुताशनः। एवं त्वमपि धर्मात्मन् पुरुषाग्निः प्रतापवान्॥<br />The blazing sacrificial fire eats all the oblations of clarified butter poured upon it. Of pious soul, and gifted with great energy, you are among men, a blazing fire in energy.</p>
<p id='37'>प्रसादयामहे विद्वन् भवन्तं प्रणता वयम्। अनुग्रहार्थमस्माकमियं गौः प्रतिगृह्यताम्॥<br />We propitiate you, O you of great learning. We surrender ourselves to you. Do you, for showing us favour, take back from us this cow.</p>
<p id='38'>च्यवन उवाच कृपणस्य च यच्चक्षुर्मुनेराशीविषस्य च। नरं समूलं दहति कक्षमग्निरिव ज्वलन्।॥<br />Chyavana said The eye of a poor or distressed person, the eye of an ascetic, or the eye of a snake of dreadful poison, consume a man with his very roots even as a fire, that burning with the aid of the wind and consumes a stack of dry grass or straw.</p>
<p id='39'>प्रतिगृह्णामि वो धेनुं कैवर्ता मुक्तकिल्बिषाः। दिवं गच्छत वै क्षिप्रं मत्स्यैः सह जलोद्भवैः॥<br />I shall accept the cow that you wish to present me-You fishermen, freed from every sin, go ye to heaven forthwith, with these fishes also that you have caught with your nets.</p>
<p id='40'>भीष्म उवाच ततस्तस्य प्रभावात् ते महर्षेर्भावितात्मनः। निषादास्तेन वाक्येन सह मत्स्यैर्दिवं ययुः॥<br />Bhishma said After this, on account of the energy of that great Rishi of purified soul, those fishermen along with all those fish, through virtue of those words that he had uttered, went to heaven.</p>
<p id='41'>ततः स राजा नहुषो विस्मितः प्रेक्ष्य धीवरान्। आरोहमाणांस्त्रिदिवं मत्स्यांश्च भरतर्षभ॥<br />Seeing the fishermen ascending to heaven with those fishes in their company, became filled with wonder, O chief of Bharata's race.</p>
<p id='42'>ततस्तौ गविजश्चैव च्यवनश्च भृगूद्वहः। वराभ्यामनुरूपाभ्यां छन्दयामासतु पम्॥<br />After this, the two Rishis, viz., the one born of a cow and the other who was Chyavana of Bhrigu's race, pleased king Nahusha by granting him many boons.</p>
<p id='43'>ततो राजा महावीर्यो नहुषः पृथिवीपतिः। परमित्यब्रवीत् प्रीतस्तदा भरतसत्तम॥<br />Then the highly energetic king Nahusha that lord of all the Earth, filled with joy, O best of the Bharatas, said-Sufficient.</p>
<p id='44'>ततो जग्राह धर्मे स स्थितिमिन्द्रनिभो नृपः। तथेति चोदितः प्रीतस्तावृषी प्रत्यपूजयत्॥<br />Like a second, Indra the king of the celestials, he accepted the boon about his own steadiness in virtue. The Rishis having granted him the boon, the delighted king adored them both with great respect.</p>
<p id='45'>समाप्तदीक्षश्च्यवनस्ततोऽगच्छत् स्वमाश्रमम्। गविजश्च महातेजाः स्वमाश्रमपदं ययौ॥<br />As regards Chyavana, his vow having been completed, he returned to his own hermitage. The Rishi who had taken his birth from the cow, and who was gifted with great energy, also proceeded to his own hermitage.</p>
<p id='46'>निषादाश्च दिवं जग्मुस्ते च मत्स्या जनाधिप। नहुषोऽपि वरं लब्वा प्रविवेश स्वकं पुरम्॥<br />The Nishadas all ascended to heaven, as also the fishes they had caught, O king, king Nahusha too, having got those valuable boons, entered his own city.</p>
<p id='47'>एतत्ते कथितं तात यन्मां त्वं परिपृच्छसि। दर्शने यादृशः स्नेहः संवासे वा युधिष्ठिर॥ महाभाग्यं गवां चैव तथा धर्मविनिश्चयम्। किं भूयः कथ्यतां वीर किं ते हदि विवक्षितम्॥<br />I have thus, O son, told you everything about what you had asked me. The affection that is caught by the sight alone of others as also by the fact of living with them, O Yudhishthira, and the high blessedness of kine too, and the ascertainment of true virtue, are the subject I have described. Tell me, O hero what else is in your mind.</p>
