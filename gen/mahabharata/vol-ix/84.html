<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 84</h3><h4>An account of gold and its gifts</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच उक्तं पितामहेनदं गवां दानमनुत्तमम्। विशेषेण नरेन्द्राणामिह धर्ममवेक्षताम्॥<br />Yudhishthira said You have, O grandfather, expounded to me the highly meritorious gift of kine. In the case of kings performing their duties, that gift is most meritorious.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>राज्यं हि सततं दुःखं दुर्धरं चाकृतात्मभिः। भूयिष्ठं च नरेन्द्राणां विद्यते न शुभा गतिः॥<br />Sovereignty is always painful. It is incapable of being borne by persons of impure souls. Generally kings fail to acquire auspicious ends.</p>

<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>एवमेव गवामुक्तं प्रदानं ते नृगेण ह। ऋषिणा नाचिकेतेन पूर्वमेव निदर्शितम्॥<br />You have described to me the gifts of kine formerly made by king Nriga. The Rishi Nachiketa, in ancient times, had described the merits of this act.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>वेदोपनिषदश्चैव सर्वकर्मसु दक्षिणाः। सर्वक्रतुषु चोद्दिष्टं भूमिर्गावोऽथ काञ्चनम्॥<br />The Vedas and the Upanishads also have laid down that in all sacrifices, in fact, in all sorts of religious rites, the sacrificial present should be earth or kine or gold.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>तत्र श्रुतिस्तु परमा सुवर्णं दक्षिणेति वै। एतदिच्छाम्यहं श्रोतुं पितामह यथातथम्॥<br />The Shrutis, however, declare that of all presents, gold is very superior and is, indeed, the best. I wish, O grandfather, to hear you describe truly this subject.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>किं सुवर्णं कथं जातं कस्मिन् काले किमात्मकम्। किं दैवं किं फलं चैव कस्माच्च परमुच्यते॥<br />What is gold? How did it spring up? When did it come into existence? What is its essence? Who is its presiding god? What are its fruits. Why is it considered as the foremost of all things?</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>कस्माद् दानं सुवर्णस्य पूजयन्ति मनीषिणः। कस्माच्च दक्षिणार्थं तद् यज्ञकर्मसु शस्यते॥<br />Why do wise men applaud the gift of gold? Why is gold considered as the best of presents in all sacrifices?</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>कस्माच्च पावनं श्रेष्ठं भूमेर्गोभ्यश्च काञ्चनम्। परमं दक्षिणार्थे च तद् ब्रवीहि पितामह॥<br />Why also is gold considered as a purifier superior to earth itself and kine? Why, indeed, is it considered so superior as a sacrificial present? Do you, O grandfather, describe to me all this.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>भीष्म उवाच शृणु राजन्नवहितो बहुकारणविस्तरम्। जातरूपसमुत्पत्तिमनुभूतं च यन्मया।॥<br />Bhishma said Listen, O king, with rapt attention to me as I recite to you in detail the circumstances connected with the origin of gold as understood by me.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>पिता मम महातेजाः शान्तनुर्निधनं गतः। तस्य दित्सुरहं श्राद्धं गङ्गाद्वारमुपागमम्॥<br />When my highly energetic father Shantanu died, I proceeded to Gangadvara for performing his Shraddha.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>तत्रागम्य पितुः पुत्र श्राद्धकर्म समारभम्। माता मे जाह्नवी चात्र साहाय्यमकरोत् तदा॥<br />Arrived there I began the Shraddha of my father. My mother Janhavi coming there, gave me great assistance.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>ततोऽग्रतस्ततः सिद्धानुपवेश्य बहूनृषीन्। तोयप्रदानात् प्रभृति कार्याण्यहमथारभम्॥<br />Inviting many ascetics crowned with success and making them take their seats before me, I began the preliminary rites consisting of gifts of water and of other things.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>तत् समाप्य यथोद्दिष्टं पूर्वकर्म समाहितः। दातुं निर्वपणं सम्यग् यथावदहमारभम्॥<br />Having with concentrated mind performed all preliminary rites as laid down in the scriptures, I began to duly offer the obsequial cake.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>ततस्तं दर्भविन्यासं भित्त्वा सुरुचिरागदः। प्रलम्बाभरणो बाहुरुदतिष्ठद् विशाम्पते॥<br />I then saw, O king, that a beautiful arm, adorned with armlets and other ornaments, rose a up, piercing the ground, through the blades of Kusha grass which I had spread.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>तमुत्थितमहं दृष्ट्वा परं विस्मयमागमम्। प्रतिग्रहीता साक्षान्मे पितेति भरतर्षभ॥<br />Seeing that arm rise from the ground, I became stricken with wonder. Indeed, O chief of Bharata's race, I thought that my father had come himself for accepting the cake I was about to offer.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>ततो मे पुनरेवासीत् संज्ञा संचिन्त्य शास्त्रतः। नायं वेदेषु विहितो विधिहस्त इति प्रभो॥ पिण्डो देयो नरेणेह ततो मतिरभून्मम। साक्षान्नेह मनुष्यस्य पिण्डं हि पितरः क्वचित्॥ गृह्णन्ति विहितं चेत्थं पिण्डो देयः कुशेष्विति। ततोऽहं तदनादृत्य पितुर्हस्तनिदर्शनम्॥ शास्त्रप्रमाण्यसूक्ष्मं तु विधिं पिण्डस्य संस्मरन्। ततो दर्भेषु तत् सर्वमददं भरतर्षभ।॥<br />Reflecting then, by the light of the scriptures. I became convinced that the ordinance is in the Vedas that the cake should not be presented to the hand of him whose Shraddha is performed. My conviction was that the obsequial cake should never be presented in this world by a man to the visible hand of the nan whose obsequial rites are performed. The departed Manes do not come in their visible forms for taking the cake. On the other hand, the ordinance lays down that it should be presented on the blades of Kusha grass spread the earth for the purpose. I then, disregarding that hand which was the mark of may father's presence, and recollecting the true ordinance of the scriptures regarding to mode of presenting the cake, offered the entire cake, O chief of the Bharatas, upon those blades of Kusha grass that were spread before me.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>शास्त्रमार्गानुसारेण तद् विद्धि मनुजर्षभ। तत: सोऽन्तर्हितो बाहुः पितुर्मम जनाधिप॥<br />Know, O king, that what I did was perfectly consistent with the scriptural ordinance. After this, the arm of my father, O monarch, vanished, in our very sight. on more</p>

Pleased with me they said, O chief of Bharata's race, these words, We have been pleased with you, for the mark you have shown today of your adherence to the ordinance. It has pleased us to see that you have not deviated from the injunctions of the scriptures. The scriptural ordinance, followed by you, has become authoritative, O king.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>आत्मा धर्मः श्रुतं वेदाः पितरश्चर्षिभिः सह। साक्षात् पितामहो ब्रह्मा गुरवोऽथ प्रजापतिः॥ प्रमाणमुपनीता वै स्थिताश्च न विचालिताः। तदिदं सम्यगारब्धं त्वयात्र भरतर्षभ॥<br />By such conduct you have honoured and maintained the authority of yourself, the scriptures, the Vedas, the Pitris and the Rishis, the Grandfather Brahman himself, and those elders, viz., the Prajapatis. Adherence to the scriptures has been upheld. You have today, O chief of the Bharatas, acted very properly.</p>

Do you make gifts of gold. The gift of gold is very purifying. O you that are wellconversant with duties, know that by such acts both ourselves and our forefathers will all be purged of all our sins. Such gifts rescue both ancestors, and descendants of tenth degree of the person who makes them! These were the words that my ancestors, appearing to me in a dream, said to me. I then awoke, o king, and become filled with wonder.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>सुवर्णदानेऽकरवं मतिं च भरतर्षभ। इतिहासमिमं चापि शृणु राजन् पुरातनम्॥<br />Indeed, O chief of Bharata's race, I determined upon making gifts of gold, Listen now, O king, to this old history.</p>

It was first recited to Rama the son of Jamadagni. Formerly Jamadagni's son Rama, existed with great anger, rooted out the Kshatriyas from off the face of the Earth for twentyone times. Having subjugated the entire Earth, the heroic Rama having cyes like lotus petals began to make preparations for celebrating a Horse Sacrifice, O king, that is lauded by all Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and that is capable of granting the fruition of every desire.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>पावनं सर्वभूतानां तेजोद्युतिविवर्धनम्। विपाप्मा च स तेजस्व तेन क्रतुफलेन च॥<br />That sacrifice purifies all creatures and increases the energy and splendour of those who succeed in celebrating it. Gifted with great energy, Rama, by the celebration of that sacrifice, became sinless.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>नैवात्मनोऽथ लघुतां जामदग्न्योऽध्यगच्छत। स तु क्रतुवरेणेष्वा महात्मा दक्षिणावता॥<br />Having, however, celebrated that foremost of sacrifices, the great Rama could not acquire perfect lightness of heart.</p>

Filled with repentance and mercy, he addressed them, saying, highly blessed ones, do you declare that which purifies men engaged in terrific deeds? Thus addressed by him, those great Rishis, fully read in the Vedas and the scriptures, answered him, saying, ( Rama, guided by the authority of the Vedas, do you honour all learned Brahmanas. Acting thus for sometime, do you once more ask the twice born Rishis as to what should be done by you for purifying yourself.</p>

Going then to Vashishtha and Agastya and Kashyapa, that delighter of the Bhrigus, gifted with great energy, asked them the very question, You foremost of Brahmanas, even this is the wish that has originated in my heart.
