<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 81</h3><h4>Description of sacred things</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच पवित्राणां पवित्रं यच्छिष्टं लोके च यद् भवेत्। पावनं परमं चैव तन्मे ब्रूहि पितामह॥<br />Yudhishthira said Tell me, O grandfather, what is that which is the most sacred of all sacred things in the world, other than that which has been already mentioned, and which is the greatest of all purifying objects.</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच गावो महार्थाः पुण्याश्च तारयन्ति च मानवान्। धारयन्ति प्रजाश्चमा हविषा पयसा तथा॥<br />Bhishma said Kine are the foremost of all objects. They are highly sacred and they save men. With their milk and with the Havi manufactured therefrom, kine sustain all creatures in the universe.</p>
<p id='3'>न हि पुण्यतमं किंचिद् गोभ्यो भरतसत्तम। एताः पुण्याः पवित्राश्च त्रिषु लोकेषु सत्तमाः॥<br />O best of the Bharatas, there is nothing that is more sacred than kine. The highest of all things in the three worlds, kine are themselves sacred and capable of purifying others.</p>
<p id='4'>देवानामुपरिष्टाच्च गावः प्रतिवसन्ति वै। दत्त्वा चैतास्तारयन्ते यान्ति स्वर्ग मनीषिणः॥<br />Kine live in a region that is even greater than the region of the celestials. When given away, they save their givers. Wise men succeed in acquiring the celestial region by making gifts of kine.</p>

<p id='6'>गताः परमकं स्थानं देवैरपि सुदुर्लभम्। अपि चात्र पुरागीतां कथयिष्यामि तेऽनघ॥<br />As thc reward of those gifts, they have acquired such regions as are unattainable by the very celestials. There is, about it, O sinless one, a discourse delivered of yore. I shall recite it to you.</p>
<p id='7'>ऋषीणामुत्तमं धीमान् कृष्णद्वैपायनं शुकः। अभिवाद्याह्निककृतः शुचिः प्रयतमानसः॥ पितरं परिपप्रच्छ दृष्टलोकपरावरम्। को यज्ञः सर्वयज्ञानां वरिष्ठोऽभ्युपलक्ष्यते॥<br />Once on a time, having finished his morning rites, the intelligent Shuka approached with a controlled mind his father, that foremost of Rishis, viz., the Island-born Krishna, who knows the distinction between the superior and the inferior, and saluting him, said, What is that sacrifice which appears to you as the foremost of all sacrifices?</p>
<p id='8'>किं च कृत्वा परं स्थानं प्राप्नुवन्ति मनीषिणः। केन देवाः पवित्रेण स्वर्गमश्नन्ति वा विभो॥<br />What is that act by doing which wise men succeed in acquiring the highest region? What is that sacred deed by which the celestials enjoy divine happiness?</p>
<p id='9'>किं च यज्ञस्य यज्ञत्वं क्व च यज्ञः प्रतिष्ठितः। देवानामुत्तमं किं च किं च सत्रमितः परम्॥ पवित्राणां पवित्रं च यत् तद् ब्रूहि पितर्मम।<br />What forms the character of sacrifice as sacrifice? What is that upon which sacrifice rests? What is that which is considered as the best by the deities? What is that sacrifice which is above the sacrifices of this world? Do you also tell me, O father what is that which is the most sacred of all things.</p>
