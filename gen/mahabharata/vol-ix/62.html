<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 62</h3><h4>A description of the best of all gifts</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच इदं देयमिदं देयमितीयं श्रुतिरादरात्। बहुदेयाश्च राजानः किंस्विद् दानमनुत्तमम्॥<br />Yudhishthira said People accept with respect the sayings of the Shrutis which say-This is to be given. This other thing is to be given! As regards kings, again, they make gifts of various things to various men. What, however, O grandfather is the best or foremost of all gifts?</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>भीष्म उवाच अतिदानानि सर्वाणि पृथिवीदानमुच्यते। अचला ह्यक्षया भूमिर्दोग्ध्री कामानिहोत्तमान्॥<br />Bhishma said Of all kinds of gifts, the gift of earth is said to be the first. earth is immovable and indestructible. It is capable of giving to him who possesses it all the best things upon which he may like to have.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>दोग्ध्री वासांसि रत्नानि पशून् व्रीहियवांस्तथा। भूमिदः सर्वभूतेषु शाश्वतीरेधते समाः॥<br />It gives dresses and vestments, jewels and gems, animals, paddy, and barley. Amongst all creatures, the giver of earth grows rich for ever and ever.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>यावद् भूमेरायुरिह तावद् भूमिद एधते। न भूमिदानादस्तीह परं किंचिद् युधिष्ठिर॥<br />As long as the earth lasts, so long does the giver thereof grow rich. There is no gift that is higher, O Yudhishthira, than the gift of earth.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>अप्यल्पं प्रददुः सर्वे पृथिव्या इति नः श्रुतम्। भूमिमेव ददुःसर्वे भूमि ते भुञ्जते जनाः॥<br />we have heard that all men have given a little quantity of earth. All men have made gifts of earth, hence all men enjoy a little of earth.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>स्वकर्मैवोपजीवन्ति नरा इह परत्र च। भूमिभूतिर्महादेवी दातारं कुरुते प्रियम्॥<br />Whether in this or in the next world, all creatures live subject to their own deeds. Earth is Prosperity's self. She is a powerful goddess. She makes him her lord who makes gifts of her in this life to her people.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>य एतां दक्षिणां दद्यादक्षयां राजसत्तम। पुनर्नरत्वं सम्प्राप्य भवेत् स पृथिवीपतिः॥<br />That person, O best of kings, who gives away earth, which is indestructible, as gift, is born in next life as a man and becomes also a lord of Earth.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>यथा दानं तथा भोग इति धर्मेषु निश्चयः। संग्रामे वा तनुं जह्याद् दद्याच्च पृथिवीमिमाम्॥<br />The quantity of one's enjoyment in this life is equal to one's gifts in a pristine life. This is the conclusion pointed out by the scriptures. For a Kshatriya should either give away the Earth in gift or renounce his life in battle.</p>
