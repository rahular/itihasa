<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 3</h3><h4>The story of Vishvamitra as being promoted from a Kshatriya to a Brahmana</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच ब्राह्मण्यं यदि दुष्प्राप्यं त्रिभिर्वर्णैर्नराधिप। कथं प्राप्तं महाराज क्षत्रियेण महात्मना॥ विश्वामित्रेण धर्मात्पन् ब्राह्मणत्वं नरर्षभ। श्रोतुमिच्छामि तत्त्वेन तन्मे ब्रूहि पितामह॥<br />Yudhishthira said If, O prince, it is so very difficult for the other three castes to acquire Brahmanahood, how then did the great Vishvasmitra, O king, though a Kshatriya, acquire the status of a Brahmana? I desire to know this, O sire! Therefore, do you truly describe this matter to me.</p>
<p id='2'>तेन ह्यमितवीर्येण वसिष्ठस्य महात्मनः। हतं पुत्रशतं सद्यस्तपसाऽपि पितामह॥<br />O Sire, by virtue of his austerities that powerful man destroyed in a moment the hundred sons of the great Vasishtha.</p>
<p id='3'>यातुधानाश्च बहवो राक्षसास्तिग्मतेजसः। मन्युनाऽऽविष्टदेहेन सृष्टाः कालान्तकोपमाः॥<br />While under the influence of ire, he created numberless evil spirits and Rakshasas of great vigour and resembling the great destroyer Kala himself.</p>
<p id='4'>महान् कुशिकवंशश्च ब्रह्मर्षिशतसंकुलः। स्थापितो नरलोकेऽस्मिन् विद्वद्ब्राह्मणसंस्तुतः॥<br />The great and learned family of Kushika, containing hundreds of twiceborn sages in it and highly spoken of by the Brahmanas, was founded in this world of men by him.</p>
<p id='5'>ऋचीकस्यात्मजश्चैव शुनःशेपो महातपाः। विमोक्षितो महासत्रात् पशुतामप्युपागतः॥<br />Having been sought to be killed as an animal in the great sacrifice of Amvarisha, Shunashepha of austere penances the son of Richika acquired his deliverance through Vishvamitra.</p>
<p id='6'>हरिश्चन्द्रक्रतौ देवांस्तोषयित्वाऽऽत्मतेजसा। पुत्रतामनु सम्प्राप्तो विश्वामित्रस्य धीमतः॥<br />Having pleased the gods at a sacrifice Harishchandra became a son of the wise Vishvamitra.</p>
<p id='7'>नाभिवादयते ज्येष्ठं देवरातं नराधिप। पुत्राः पञ्चाशदेवापि शप्ताः श्वपचतां गताः॥<br />For not having honoured their eldest brother Devarat, the other fifty brothers of his were imprecated, and all of them became Chandalas.</p>
<p id='8'>त्रिशङ्कुर्वन्धुभिर्मुक्त ऐक्ष्वाकः प्रीतिपूर्वकम्। अवाशिरा दिवं नीतो दक्षिणामाश्रितो दिशम्॥<br />When abandoned by his friends, and hanging with his head down wards in the lower regions, Trisanku, the son of Ikshaku, was translated to heaven at the pleasure of Vishvamitra.</p>
<p id='9'>विश्वामित्रस्य विपुला नदी देवर्षिसेविता। कौशिकी च शिवा पुण्या ब्रह्मर्षिसुरसेविता॥<br />Vishvamitra had a large river, named Kaushiki, that was frequented by celestial Rishis. This sacred and suspicious river was frequented by the celestials and twiceborn Rishis.</p>
<p id='10'>तपोविनकरी चैव पञ्चचूडा सुसम्मता। रम्भा नामाप्सराः शापाद् यस्य शैलत्वमागता॥<br />For disturbing his devotions, the famous celestial nymph Rambha, having fine bracelets, was cursed and changed into a rock.</p>
<p id='11'>तथैवास्य भयाद् बद्ध्वा वसिष्ठः सलिले पुरा। आत्मानं मज्जयन् श्रीमान् विपाशः पुनरुत्थितः॥<br />From fear of Vishvamitra the glorious Vasishtha, in days of yore, binding himself with creepers, threw himself down into a river and again rose released from his fetters,</p>
<p id='12'>तदाप्रभृति पुण्या हि विपाशाऽभून्महानदी। विख्याता कर्मणा तेन वसिष्ठस्य महात्मनः॥<br />On account of this, that large and sacred river became thenceforth famous by the name of Vipasha.</p>
<p id='13'>वाग्भिश्च भगवान् येन देवसेनाग्रगः प्रभुः। स्तुतः प्रीतमनाश्चासीच्छापाञ्चैनममुञ्चत॥ ध्रुवस्यौत्तानपादस्य ब्रह्मर्षीणां तथैव च। मध्यं ज्वलति यो नित्यमुदीचीमाश्रितो दिशम्॥<br />He prayed to the glorious and powerful Indra who was pleased with him and freed him from a curse. Remaining on the northern side of the sky, he sheds his lustre from a position in the midst of the seven twiceborn Rishis, and Dhruva the son of Uttanpada.</p>
<p id='14'>तस्यैतानि च कर्माणि तथान्यानि च कौरव। क्षत्रियस्येत्यतो जातमिदं कौतूहलं मम॥<br />These and many others are his feats. O descendant of Kuru, my curiosity has been kindled in this respect, because they were performed by a Kshstriya.</p>
<p id='15'>किमेतदिति तत्त्वेन प्रब्रूहि भरतर्षभ। देहान्तरमनासाद्य कथं स ब्राह्मणोऽभवत्॥<br />Therefore, O foremost one of Bharata's race do you relate this matter to me truly! How without renouncing his body and taking another body of flesh could he become a Brahmana?</p>
<p id='16'>एतत् तत्त्वेन मे तात सर्वमाख्यातुमर्हसि। मतङ्गस्य यथातत्त्वं तथैवैतद् वदस्व मे॥<br />Do you, O sire, truly describe this matter to me as you have described to me the story of Matanga.</p>
<p id='17'>स्थाने मतङ्गा ब्राह्मण्यं नालभद् भरतर्षभ। चण्डालयोनौ जातो हि कथं ब्राह्मण्यमाप्तवान्॥<br />Matanga was born as a Chandala, and could not acquire Brahmanahood, but how could this man acquire the status of a Brahmana?</p>
<p id='18'>किमेतदिति तत्त्वेन प्रब्रूहि भरतर्षभ। देहान्तरमनासाद्य कथं स ब्राह्मणोऽभवत्॥<br />Therefore, O foremost one of Bharata's race do you relate this matter to me truly! How without renouncing his body and taking another body of flesh could he become a Brahmana?</p>
