One who wishes to live long should never disregard or insult any of these three, however weak or emaciated they may appear to be, viz., the Brahmana, the Kshatriya, and the snake. All three are gifted with dreadful poison. The snake, of angry, burns the victim with only a look of its eye.</p>

The Brahmana, stronger than any of these two, destroys, not only the object of his anger but his entire family as well, not by looks alone but by thought also.</p>
