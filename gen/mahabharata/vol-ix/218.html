<h3>ANUGITA PARVA: Chapter 50</h3><h4>Abstention from Injury. Association and disassociation of Soul and Naturc.</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>ब्रह्मोवाच हन्त वः संप्रवक्ष्यामि यन्मां पृच्छथ सत्तमाः। गुरुणा शिष्यमासाद्य यदुक्तं तन्निबोधत॥<br />Well then I shall describe to you what you ask. Learn what was told by a preceptor to a disciple who came to him.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>समस्तमिह तच्छ्रुत्वा सम्यगेवावधार्यताम्। अहिंसा सर्वभूतानामेतत् कृत्यतमं मतम्॥<br />Hearing it all, do you settle properly (what it should be). Abstention from injuring any creature is considered as the foremost of all duties.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>एतत् पदमनुद्विग्नं वरिष्ठं धर्मलक्षणम्। ज्ञानं निःश्रेय इत्याहुवृद्धा निश्चितदर्शिनः॥<br />That is the highest seat, shorn of anxiety and forming a mark of holiness. The ancients who had seen the certain truth, have said that knowledge is the highest happiness.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>तस्माज्ज्ञानेन शुद्धेन मुच्यते सर्वकिल्बिषैः। हिंसापराश्च ये केचिद् ये च नास्तिकवृत्तयः। लोभमोहसमायुक्तास्ते वै निरयगामिनः॥ आशीर्युक्तानि कर्माणि कुर्वते ये त्वतन्द्रिताः। तेऽस्मिल्लोके प्रमोदन्ते जायमानाः पुनः पुनः॥ कुर्वते ये तु कर्माणि श्रद्दधाना विपश्चितः। अनाशीर्योगसंयुक्तास्ते धीराः साघुदर्शिनः॥<br />Hence, one becomes freed of all sins by pure knowledge. they who are engaged in destruction and harm, they who are infidels in conduct, have to go to Hell on account of their being gifted with cupidity and delusion. Those who, without idleness, perform acts moved thereto by expectation, become repeatedly born in this world and sport in happiness. Those men who, gifted with learning and wisdom, perforın acts with faith, free from expectations, and possessed of concentration of mind, are said to perceive clearly.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>अतः परं प्रवक्ष्यामि सत्त्वक्षेत्रज्ञयोर्यथा। संयोगो विप्रयोगश्च तन्निबोधत सत्तमाः॥ विषयो विषयित्वं च सम्बन्धोऽयमिहोच्यते।<br />I shall, after this. describe how the association and the disassociation takes place of Soul and Nature. You best of men, listen. The relation here is said to be that betwcen the object and the subject.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>विषयी पुरुषो नित्यं सत्त्वं च विषयः स्मृतः॥ व्याख्यातं पूर्वकल्पेन मशकोदुम्बरं यथा। भुज्यमानं न जानीते नित्यं सत्त्वमचेतनम्। यस्त्वेवं तं विजानीते यो भुङ्क्ते यश्च भुज्यते॥<br />Purusha is always the subject; and Nature the object. It has been explained, by what has been said in a previous part of the discourse where it has been pointed out, that they exist after the manner of the gnat and the Udumbara,</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>नित्यं द्वन्द्वसमायुक्तं सत्त्वमाहुर्मनीषिणः। निर्द्वन्द्वो निष्कलो नित्यः क्षेत्रज्ञो निर्गुणात्मकः॥<br />An object of enjoyment as it is, Nature is unintelligent and knows nothing. He, however, who enjoys it, is said to know it, Soul being enjoyer, Nature is enjoyed.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>समं संज्ञानुगश्चैव स सर्वत्र व्यवस्थितः। उपभुङ्क्ते सदा सत्त्वमप: पुष्करपर्णवत्॥<br />The wise have said that Nature is always made up of pairs of opposites. Soul is, on the other hand, destitute of pairs of opposites, devoid of parts, eternal, and free, about its essence, from qualities.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>सर्वैरपि गुणैर्विद्वान् व्यतिषक्तो न लिप्यते। जलबिन्दुर्यथा लोलः पद्मिनीपत्रसंस्थितः॥<br />He lives in everything alike, and walks with knowledge. He always enjoys Nature as a lotus leaf (enjoys) water.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>एवमेवाप्यसंयुक्तः पुरुषः स्यान्न संशयः। द्रव्यमात्रमभूत् सत्त्वं पुरुषस्येति निश्चयः॥<br />Endued with knowledge, he is never tainted even if brought into contact with all the qualities.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>यथा द्रव्यं च कर्ता च संयोगोऽप्यनयोस्तथा। यथा प्रदीपमादाय कश्चित् तमसि गच्छति।<br />Forsooth, Purusha is unattached like the unsteady drop of water on the lotus leaf. This is the certain conclusion that Nature is the property of Purusha.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>तथा सत्त्वप्रदीपेन गच्छन्ति परमैषिणः॥ यावद् द्रव्यं गुणस्तावत् प्रदीपः सम्प्रकाशते।<br />The relation between these two (viz., Purusha and Nature) is like that existing between matter and its maker. As one goes into a dark place carrying a light with him, so those who wish for the Supreme proceed with the light of Nature. As long as matter and quality exist, so long the light shines.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>क्षीणे द्रव्ये गुणे ज्योतिरन्तर्धानाय गच्छति॥ व्यक्तः सत्त्वगुणस्त्वेवं पुरुषोऽव्यक्त इष्यते।<br />The flame, however, becomes put out when matter and quality (or oil and wick) are exhausted. Thus Nature is manifest; while Purusha is said to be unmanifest.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>एतद् विप्रा विजानीत हन्त भूयो ब्रवीमि वः॥ सहस्रेणापि दुर्मेधा न बुद्धिमधिगच्छति।<br />Understand this, you learned Brahmanas! Well, I shall now tell you something more. With even a thousand (explanations), one who has a bad understanding succeeds not in acquiring knowledge.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>चतुर्थेनाप्यथांशेन बुद्धिमान् सुखमेधते॥ एवं धर्मस्य विज्ञेयं संसाधनमुपायतः। उपायज्ञो हि मेधावी सुखमत्यन्तमश्नुते॥<br />One, however, who is gifted with intelligence succeeds in acquiring happiness, through only a fourth share (c: explanations). Thus should the accomplishment of duty be understood as dependent on means. For the intelligent man, having knowledge of means, succeeds in acquiring supreme happiness.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>यथाध्वानमपाथेयः प्रपन्नो मनुजः क्वचित्। क्लेशेन याति महता विनश्येदन्तरापि च॥ तथा कर्मसु विज्ञेयं फलं भवति वा न वा।<br />As some man travelling along a road without provisions of his journey, proceeds with great uneasiness and may even meet with destruction before he reaches the end of his journey, so should it be known that in deeds there may or may not be fruits.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>पुरुषस्यात्मनिःश्रेयः शुभाशुभनिदर्शनम्॥ यथा च दीर्घमध्वानं पद्भ्यामेव प्रपद्यते। अदृष्टपूर्वं सहसा तत्त्वदर्शनवर्जितः॥ तमेव च यथाध्वानं रथेनेहाशुगामिना। गच्छत्यश्वप्रयुक्तेन तथा बुद्धिमतां गतिः॥ ऊर्ध्वं पर्वतमारुह्य नान्ववेक्षेत भूतलम्।<br />The examination of what is agreeable and what disagrceable is one's own self, yields benefit. The progress in life of a man who is devoid of the perception of truth is like that of a man who rashly journey on a long road unseen before. The progress, however, of those who are gifted with intelligence, is like that of men who journey along the same road, riding on a car to which are yoked (fleet) horses and which moves with swiftness. Having ascended to the top of a mountain, one should not cast his eyes on the surface of the earth.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>रथेन रथिनं पश्य क्लिश्यमानमचेतनम्॥ यावद् रथपथस्तावद् रथेन स तु गच्छति।<br />Sceing a man, even though travelling on a car, afflicted and rendered insensible by pain, the inielligent man journeys on a car as long as there is a car-path.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>क्षीणे रथपदे विद्वान् रथमुत्सृज्य गच्छति॥ एवं गच्छति मेधावी तत्त्वयोगविधानवित्। परिज्ञाय गुणज्ञश्च उत्तरादुत्तरोत्तरम्॥<br />The learned man, when he sees the car-path end, abandons his car for going on. Thus does the intelligent man who knows the ordinances about truth and Yoga, proceed. Knowing the qualities, such man, proceeds, comprehending what is next and next.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>यथार्णवं महाघोरमप्लवः सम्प्रगाहते। बाहुभ्यामेव सम्मोहाद् वधं वाञ्छत्यसंशयम्॥ नावा चापि यथा प्राज्ञो विभागज्ञः स्वरित्रया। अश्रान्तः सलिले गच्छेच्छीघ्रं संतरते ह्रदम्॥ तीर्णो गच्छेत् परं पारं नावमुत्सृज्य निर्ममः।<br />As one who plunges, without a boat, into the terrible ocean, with only ones two arms, through delusion, undoubtedly wishes for a range. After destruction; while the wise man conversant with distinctions, goes into the water, with a boat having oars, and soon crosses the lake without fatigue, and having crossed it gets to the other shore and leaves off the boat, freed from the thought of mineness.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>व्याख्यातं पूर्वकल्पेन यथा रथपदातिनोः॥ स्नेहात् सम्मोहमापन्नो नावि दाशो यथा तथा।<br />This has been already explained by the illustration of the car and the pedestrian. One who has been overwhelmed by delusion on account of attachment, sticks to it like a fisherman to his boat.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>ममन्वेनाभिभूत: संस्तत्रैव परिवर्तते॥ नावं न शक्यपारुह्य स्थले विपरिवर्तितुम्।<br />Overcome by the idea of mineness, one wanders within its narrow embarking on a boat it is not possible in moving about on land.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>तथैव रथमारुह्य नाप्सु चर्या विधीयते॥ एवं कर्म कृतं चित्रं विषयस्थं पृथक् पृथक्।<br />Likewise, it is not possible in moving abut on water after one has got on a car. There are thus various actions about various objects.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>यथा कर्म कृतं लोके तथैतानुपद्यते॥ यनैव गन्धिनो रस्यं न रूपस्पर्शशब्दवत्। मन्यन्ते मुनयो बुद्ध्या तत् प्रधानं प्रचक्षते॥ तत्र प्रधानमव्यक्तमव्यक्तस्य गुणो महान्।<br />And as action is performed in this world, so does it result to those who perform them. That which is void of smell. void of taste, and void of touch and sound, that which is meditated upon by the sages with the help of their understanding is said to be Pradhana. Now, Pradhana is unmanifest. A development of the uninanife-t is Mahat.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>महत्प्रधानभूतस्य गुणोऽहंकार एव च॥ अहंकारात् तु सम्भूतो महाभूतकृतो गुणः।<br />A development of Pradhana when it has become Mahat is Egoism. From egoism emanates the great elements.</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>पृथक्त्वेन हि भूतानां विषया वै गुणाः स्मृताः॥ बीजधर्मं तथाव्यक्तं प्रसवात्मकमेव च।<br />And from the great elements respectively, the objects of sense proceed. The unmanifest is of the nature of seed. It produced its essence.</p>
<p id='27'><a href='#27'></a>बीजधर्मो महानात्मा प्रसवश्चेति नः श्रुतम्॥ बीजधर्मस्त्वहंकारः प्रसवश्च पुनः पुनः।<br />We have heard that the great soul has the virtues of a seed, and that is a product. Egoism is of the nature of seed and is a product again and again.</p>
<p id='28'><a href='#28'></a>बीजप्रसवधर्माणि महाभूतानि पञ्च वै॥ बीजधर्मिण इत्याहुः प्रसवं च प्रकुर्वते। विशेषाः पञ्चभूतानां तेषां चित्तं विशेषणम्॥ तत्रैकगुणमाकाशं द्विगुणो वायुरुच्यते।<br />And the five great elements are of the nature of seed and products. The objects of the five great elements are gifted with the nature of seed, and yield products. These have intelligence for their property. Among them, space has one equality; wind is said to have two.</p>
<p id='29'><a href='#29'></a>त्रिगुणं ज्यातिरित्याहुरामश्चपि चतुर्गुणाः॥ पृथ्वी पञ्चगुणा ज्ञेया चरस्थावरसंकुला।<br />Light, it is said, is gifted with three qualities; and water as possessed of four qualities.
