Tell me O grandfather what is the end that these attain to.</p>
<p id='2'>दुःखं प्राणपरित्यागः पुरुषाणां महामृधे। जानासि त्वं महाप्राज्ञ प्राणत्यागं सुदुष्करम्॥ समृद्धौ वासमृद्धौ वा शुभे वा यदि वाऽशुभे। कारणं तत्र में ब्रूहि सर्वज्ञो ह्यसि मे मतः॥<br />To give up life in battle is fraught with sorrow for men. O you of great wisdom you know that to give up life if difficult for men whether they are rich or poor or are in happiness or misery. In my opinion you are gifted with omniscience. Do you tell me the reason of this.</p>
<p id='3'>भीष्म उवाच समृद्धौ वासमृद्धौ वा शुभे वा यदि वाऽशुभे। संसारेऽस्मिन् समायाताः प्राणिनः पृथिवीपते॥<br />Bhishma said In prosperity or adversity in weal or woe, living creatures, O king, coming into this world, live according to a particular method.</p>
<p id='4'>निरता येन भावेन तत्र मे शृणु कारणम्। सम्यक् चायमनुप्रश्नस्त्वयोक्तस्तु युधिष्ठिर॥<br />Listen to me as I explain the reason to you. The question you have put to me is indeed, excellent, O Yudhishthira!</p>
<p id='5'>अत्र ते वर्तयिष्यामि पुरावृत्तमिदं नृप। द्वैपायनस्य संवादं कीटस्य च युधिष्ठिर॥<br />Regarding it, О king, I shall explain to you the old discourse that took place formerly between the Dvaipayana Rishi and a crawling worm.</p>
<p id='6'>ब्रह्मभूतश्चरन् विप्रः कृष्णद्वैपायन: पुरा। ददर्श कीटं धावन्तं शीघ्रं शकटवर्त्मनि॥<br />Formerly when that learned Brahmana, viz., the Krishna Dvaipayana having identified himself with Brahma, roamed over the world, he saw on a road over which cars used to pass a worm moving quickly.</p>
<p id='7'>गतिज्ञः सर्वभूतानां भाषाज्ञश्च शरीरिणाम्। सर्वज्ञः स तदा दृष्ट्वा कीटं वचनमब्रवीत्॥<br />The Rishi knew the of every creature and the language of every animal, Gifted with omniscience, he addressed the worm he saw in these words. course</p>
<p id='8'>व्यास उवाच कीटसंत्रस्तरूपोऽसि त्वरितश्चैव लक्ष्यसे। क्व धावसि तदाचक्ष्व कुतस्ते भयमागतम्॥<br />Vyasa said O worm, you appear to be greatly alarmed and to be in great haste. Tell me, where do you run and whence have you been afraid?</p>
<p id='9'>कीट उवाच शकटस्यास्य महतो घोषं श्रुत्वा भयं मम। आगतं वै महाबुद्धे स्वन एष हि दारुणः॥<br />The worm said I am stricken with fear on hearing the rattle of that large car. O you of great intelligence, it makes a fearful roar. It is almost come.</p>
<p id='10'>श्रूयते न च मां हन्यादिति ह्यस्मादपक्रमे। श्वसतां च शृणोम्येनं गोपुत्राणां प्रतोद्यताम्॥<br />The sound is heard. Will it not kill me? I am flying away for this, I hear the sound of the bulls.</p>
<p id='11'>वहतां सुमहाभारं संनिकर्षे स्वनं प्रभो। नृणां च संवाहयतां श्रूयते विविधः स्वनः॥<br />They are breathing hard under the whip of the driver, as they are carrying the heavy load. I hear also the various sound made by the men who are driving the bulls.</p>
<p id='12'>श्रोतुमस्मद्विधनैष न शक्यः कीटयोनिना। तस्मादतिक्रमाम्येष भयादस्मात् सुदारुणात्॥<br />Creatures which like us are born as worms, cannot bear such sounds. It is therefore that I am flying from this situation of great fright.</p>
<p id='13'>दुःखं हि मृत्युर्भूतानां जीवितं च सुदुर्लभम्। अतो भीत: पलायामि गच्छेयं नासुख सुखात्॥<br />Death is considered by all creatures as painful. Life is an acquisition difficult to make. Hence, I fly away in fear, I do not wish to pass from a state of weal to one of woe.</p>
<p id='14'>भीष्म उवाच इत्युक्तः स तु तं प्राह कुत: कीट सुखं तव। मरणं ते सुखं मन्ये तिर्यग्योनौ तु वर्तसे॥<br />Bhishma said O worm, whence can be your happiness? You belong to the intermediate order of being. I think death would be of happiness to you.</p>
<p id='15'>शब्दं स्पर्श रस गन्धं भोगांश्चोच्चवचान् बहून्। नाभिजानासि कीट त्वं श्रेयो मरणमेव ते॥<br />Sound touch, taste, scent, and various kinds of excellent enjoyments are unknown to you, O worm! I think death will prove a benefit to you.</p>
<p id='16'>कीट उवाच सर्वत्र निरतो जीव इतश्चापि सुखं मम। चिन्तयामि महाप्राज्ञ तस्मादिच्छामि जीवितुम्॥<br />The Worm said A living creature however circumstanced he may be becomes attached to it. In even this order of being I am happy, I think, O you of great wisdom! It is for this that I wish to live.</p>
<p id='17'>इहापि विषयः सर्वो यथादेहं प्रवर्तितः। मानुषाः स्थैर्यजाश्चैव पृथग्भोगा विशेषतः॥<br />In this condition every object of enjoyment exists for me according to the necessity of my body. Human beings and those creatures which originate from immobile objects have different enjoyments.</p>
<p id='18'>अहमासं मनुष्यो वै शूद्रो बहुधनः प्रभो। अब्रह्मण्यो नृशसंश्च कदर्यो वृद्धिजीवनः॥<br />In my former life I was a human being. O powerful one, I was a wealthy Shudra. I was not devoted to the Brahmanas. I was cruel, vile in conduct, and a usurer.</p>
<p id='19'>वाक्तीक्ष्णो निकृतिप्रज्ञो द्वेष्टा विश्वस्य सर्वशः। मिथ्याकृतोऽपि विधिना परस्वहरणे रतः॥<br />I was harsh in speech. I considered cunning as wisdom. I hated all creatures. Taking advantage of pretexts in agreements made between myself and others I used always to take away what belonged to others.</p>
<p id='20'>भृत्यातिथिजनश्चापि गृहे पर्यशितो मया। मात्सर्यात् स्वादुकामेन नृशंसेन बुभुक्षता॥<br />Without feeding servants and guests arrived at my house, I used to fill, when hungry, my own stomach, proud, covetous of good food, cruel as I was.</p>
<p id='21'>देवार्थं पितृयज्ञार्थमन्नं श्रद्धाऽऽहतं मया। न दत्तमर्थकामेन देयमन्नं पुरा किल॥<br />Greedy as I was of riches, I never dedicated, with faith and respect any food to the celestials and the departed Manes, although duty required me to dedicate food to them.</p>
<p id='22'>गुप्तं शरणमाश्रित्य भयेषु शरणागताः। अकस्मात् ते मया त्यक्ता न त्राता अभयैषिणः॥<br />Those men who moved by fear, came to me, for seeking my help, I sent adrift without giving them any protection. I did not extend my help to those who came to me with prayers for removing their fear.</p>
<p id='23'>धनं धान्यं प्रियान् दारान् यानं वासस्तथाद्भुतम्। श्रियं दृष्ट्वा मनुष्याणामसूयामि निरर्थकम्॥<br />I used to feel unreasonable envy at seeing other people's riches and corn, and wives held dear by them, and articles of drink, and good palaces.</p>
<p id='24'>ईष्र्युः परसुखं दृष्ट्वा अन्यस्य च बुभूषकः। त्रिवर्गहन्ता चान्येषामात्मकामानुवर्तकः॥<br />Seeing the happiness of other I was filled with envy and I always wished them poverty. Acting thus which promised to crown my own wishes with fruition, I sought to destroy the virtue, riches, and pleasures of other people.</p>
<p id='25'>नृशंसगुणभूयिष्ठं पुरा कर्म कृतं मया। स्मृत्वा तदनुतप्येऽहं हित्वा प्रियमिवात्मजम्॥<br />In that past life of mine, I committed various deeds moved by cruelty and such other passions. Recollecting those deeds I am filled with repentance and grief, as one is filled with grief at the loss of his dear son.</p>
<p id='26'>शुभानां नाभिजानामि कृतानां कर्मणां फलम्। माता च पूजिता वृद्धा ब्राह्मणश्चार्चितो मया।॥<br />On account of those deeds of mine, I do not know what the fruits are of good deeds. I, however, adored my old mother and on one occasion adored a Brahmana.</p>
<p id='27'>सकृज्जातिगुणोपेतः सङ्गत्या गृहमागतः। अतिथिः पूजितो ब्रह्मस्तेन मां नाजहात् स्मृतिः॥<br />Gifted with birth and accomplishments, that Brahmana, while travelling, came to my house once as a guest. I received him with respectful hospitality. One account of the merit of that deed my memory has not forsaken me.</p>
<p id='28'>कर्मणा पुनरेवाहं सुखमागामि लक्षये। तच्छ्रोतुमहमिच्छामि त्वत्तः श्रेयस्तपोधन॥<br />I think that on account of that deed, I shall once more succeed in regaining happiness. O you having asceticism for wealth you know everything, Tell me please what is for my behoof.</p>
