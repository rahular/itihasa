<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>दमस्य तु फलं राजञ्छृणु त्वं विस्तरेण मे। दान्ताः सर्वत्र सुखिनो दान्ताः सर्वत्र निर्वृताः॥<br />Listen now to me, O king, as I tell you in detail what that fruits, are of self-control. The self-controlled are happy everywhere. The selfcontrolled always enjoy that happiness which results from the absence or subjugation of desire.</p>
