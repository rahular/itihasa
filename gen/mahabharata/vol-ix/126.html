<h3>ANUSHASANIKA PARVA: Chapter 126</h3><h4>Deeds pleasing to Vishnu</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच केन ते च भवेत् प्रीतिः कथं तुष्टिं तु गच्छसि। इति पृष्टः सुरेन्द्रेण प्रोवाच हरिरीश्वरः॥<br />Bhishma said The king of the celestials viz., Indra after the Pitris had ceased to speak addressed the powerful Hari, saying, O Lord what are those deeds which please you? How indeed do men succeed in pleasing you?</p>
<p id='2'>विष्णु उवाच ब्राह्मणानां परीवादो मम विद्वेषणं महत्। ब्राह्मणैः पूजितैर्नित्यं पूजितोऽहं न संशयः॥<br />Vishnu said That which I greatly hate, is the detraction of Brahmanas. Forsooth, if the Brahmanas are adored I consider myself adored.</p>
<p id='3'>नित्याभिवाद्या विप्रेन्द्रा भुक्त्वा पादौ तथात्मनः। तेषां तुष्यामि मानां यश्चक्रे च बलिं हरेत्॥<br />All superior Brahmanas should always be saluted with respect, after feeding them with hospitality. One should respect his own feet also (in the evening). I am pleased with men who act thus, as also with those who worship and make offerings to the whirl that is noticeable on cowdung.</p>
<p id='4'>वामनं ब्राह्मणं दृष्ट्वा वराहं च जलोत्थिम्। उद्धृतां धरणीं चैव मूर्धा धारयते तु यः॥ न तेषामशुभं किंचित् कल्मषं चोपपद्यते। अश्वत्यं रोचनां गां च पूजयेद् यो नरः सदा॥ पूजितं च जगत् तेन सदेवासुरमानुषम्। तेन रूपेण तेषां च पूजां गृह्णामि तत्त्वतः॥<br />They who see a Brahmana that is a dwarf in stature, or a boar that has just risen from water and that bears on his head a quantity of mud taken up from the bank, have never to meet with any evil, They become freed from every sin. That man who adores every day the Ashvattha (Ficus religiosa) and the substance called Gorochana and the cow, is considered as adoring the whole universe with the celestials and Asuras and human beings. Indeed, staying within these, I accept in my own form the adoration that is offered to them.</p>
<p id='5'>पूजा ममैषा नास्त्यन्या यावल्लोकाः प्रतिष्ठिताः। अन्यथा हि वृथा माः पूजयन्त्यल्पवुद्धयः॥ नाहं तत् प्रतिगृह्णामि न सा तुष्टिकरी मम॥<br />The worship that is offered to these is the adoration offered to me. This has been so as long as the worlds have been created. Those little witted men who adore me in a different way, worship me in vain, for the worship of that kind I never accept. Indeed, the worship of other kind is not at all pleasing to me.</p>
<p id='6'>इन्द्र उवाच चक्रं पादौ वराहं च ब्राह्मणं चापि वामनम्। उद्धृतां धरणीं चैव किमर्थं त्वं प्रशंससि॥<br />Indra said Why do you speak highly of the circular marks on cowdung, the feet, the boar, the Brahmana that is a dwarf in stature and mud raised up from the soil?</p>
<p id='7'>भवान् सृजति भूतानि भवान् संहरति प्रजाः। प्रकृतिः सर्वभूतानां समानां सनातनी॥<br />It is you who create all creatures and it is you who destroy them. You are the eternal nature of all transitory things.</p>
<p id='8'>भीष्म उवाच सम्प्रहस्य ततो विष्णुरिदं वचनमब्रवीत्। चक्रेण निहता दैत्याः पद्भ्यां क्रान्ता वसुन्धरा॥<br />Bhishma said Hearing these words of Indra, Vishnu smiled a little and then said, It was with my circular disc that the Daityas were killed. It was with my two feet that the world was covered.</p>
<p id='9'>वाराहं रूपमास्थाय हिरण्याक्षो निपातितः। वामनं रूपमास्थाय जितो राजा मया बलिः॥<br />Assuming the forin of a boar I killed Hiranyaksha. Assuming the form of a dwarf I conquered king Bali.</p>
<p id='10'>परितुष्टो भवाम्येवं मानुषाणां महात्मनाम्। तन्मां ये पूजयिष्यन्ति नास्ति तेषां पराभवः॥<br />Those great men who adore these, gratify me. Indeed, they who worship me in these forms never meet with dcfeat.</p>
<p id='11'>अपि वा ब्राह्मणं दृष्ट्वा ब्रह्मचारिणमागतम्। ब्राह्मणाग्र्याहुतिं दत्त्वा अमृतं तस्य भोजनम्॥<br />If one, seeing a celibate a Brahmana arrived at one's house, offers to him the first portion of his food that belongs as of right to a Brahmana, and eats the residue he is considered as eating Amrita.</p>
<p id='12'>ऐन्द्रीं संध्यामुपासित्वा आदित्याभिमुखः स्थितः। सर्वतीर्थेषु स स्नातो मुच्यते सर्वकिल्बिषैः॥<br />If one, after worshipping the moon-twilight, stands with face directed towards the Sun, he reaps the merit that belongs to the performance of ablutions in all Tirthas and becomes purged off of all sins.</p>
<p id='13'>एतद् वः कथितं गुह्यमखिलेन तपोधनाः। संशयं पृच्छमानानां किं भूयः कथयाम्यहम्॥<br />You Rishis having penances for wealth, I have told you in detail what forms a great mystery. On what else shall I discourse to you? Tell me your doubts!</p>
<p id='14'>बलदेव उवाच श्रूयतां परमं गुह्यं मानुषाणां सुखावहम्। अजानन्तो यदबुधाः क्लिश्यन्ते भूतपीडिताः॥<br />Baladeva said Listen now to another great mystery that yields happiness to men. Unacquainted with it, ignorant persons suffer much distress from other creatures.</p>
<p id='15'>कल्य उत्थाय यो मर्त्यः स्पृशेद् गां वै घृतं दधि। सर्षपं च प्रियर्थं च कल्मषात् प्रतिमुच्यते॥<br />That man who rising early dawn, touches a cow, clarified butter and curds, as also mustard seeds and the larger variety thereof called Priyangu, becomes purged off of all his sins.</p>
<p id='16'>भूतानि चैव सर्वाणि अग्रतः पृष्ठतोऽपि वा। उच्छिष्टं वापि च्छिद्रेषु वर्जयन्ति तपोधनाः॥<br />As regards Rishis having penances for wealth they always avoid all creatures both before and behind, as also all that is impure, while performing Shraddhas.</p>
<p id='17'>देवा ऊचुः प्रगृह्यौदुम्बरं पात्रं तोयपूर्णमुदङ्मुखः। उपवासं तु गृह्णीयाद् यद् वा संकल्पयेद् व्रतम्॥ देवतास्तस्य तुष्यन्ति कामिकं चापि सिध्यति। अन्यथा हि वृथा मर्त्याः कुर्वते स्वल्पबुद्धयः॥<br />The Deities said If a person, taking a vessel of copper filling it with water and facing the East determines upon a fast or the observance of a particular vow, the celestials become pleased with him and all his wishes become crowned with fortune. By observing fasts or vows in any other way, littlewitted man gain nothing.</p>
<p id='18'>उपवासे बलौ चापि ताम्रपात्रं विशिष्यते। बलिर्भिक्षा तथाऱ्या च पितॄणां च तिलोदकम्॥ ताम्रपात्रेण दातव्यमन्यथाऽहल्पफलं भवेत्। गुह्यमेतत् समुद्दिष्टं यथा तुष्यन्ति देवताः॥<br />In uttering the resolution about the observance of fasts and in making offerings to the celestials, the use of a vessel of copper is preferable. In presenting the offerings to the celestials in (giving and accepting) alms, in presenting the ingredients of the Argha, and in offering oblations of water mixed with sesame seeds to the departed Manes, a vessel of copper should be used. By doing these acts in any other way, one acquires little merit. These mysteries have been laid down about how the deities are pleased.</p>
<p id='19'>धर्म उवाच राजपौरुषिके विप्रे घाण्टिके परिचारिके। गोरक्षके वाणिजके तथा कारुकुशीलवे॥ मित्रदुह्यनधीयाने यश्च स्याद् वृषलीपतिः। एतेषु दैवं पित्र्यं वा न देयं स्यात् कथंचन॥<br />Dharma said The offerings made in all rites in honour of the celestials and in those in honour of the departed Manes, should never be given away to a Brahmana who has accepted service under the king or who rings the bell or attends to minor duties in acts of worship or at Shraddhas, or who keeps kine or who drives a trade, or who follows some art as a profession, or who is an actor, or who quarrels with friends or who is destitute of Vedic studies, or who marries a Shudra woman.</p>
<p id='20'>पिण्डदास्तस्य हीयन्ते न च प्रीणाति वै पितॄन्। अतिथिर्यस्य भग्नाशो गृहात् प्रतिनिवर्तते॥<br />The performer of the Shraddha who gives away such offerings to such a Brahmana, losses prosperity and multiplies not his race. He fails, again to gratify his Pitris by doing such an act.</p>
<p id='21'>पितरस्तस्य देवाश्च अग्नयश्च तथैव हि। निराशा: प्रतिगच्छन्ति अतिथेरप्रतिग्रहात्॥<br />From the house of that person whence a guest returns unsatisfied, the Pitris, the deities, and the sacred fires, all return disappointed on account of such treatment of the guest.</p>
<p id='22'>स्त्रीनैर्गोनैः कृतघ्नैश्च ब्रह्मघ्नैर्गुरुतल्पगेः। तुल्यदोषो भवत्येभिर्यस्यातिथिरनर्चितः॥<br />That man who does not perform the duties of hospitality towards the guest arrived at his house comes to be considered as equally sinful with those who are slayers of women or of kine, who are ungrateful towards benefactors, who are slayers of Brahmanas, or who are violators of the beds of their preceptors.</p>
<p id='23'>अग्नि रुवाच पादमुद्यम्य यो मर्त्यः स्पृशेद् गाश्च सुदुर्मतिः। ब्राह्मणं वा महाभागं दीप्यमानं तथानलम्॥ तस्य दोषान् वक्ष्यामि तच्छृणुध्वं समाहिताः। दिवं स्पृशत्यशब्दोऽस्य त्रस्यन्ति पितरश्च वै॥ वैमनस्यं च देवानां कृतं भवति पुष्कलम्। पावकश्च महातेजा हव्यं न प्रतिगृह्णति॥<br />Agni said Listen you with rapt attention. I shall describe the demerits of that man of wicked understanding who lifts up his feet for striking therewith a cow or a highly blessed Brahmana or a burning fire. The infamy of such man spreads throughout the world and reaches the boundary of Heaven itself. His Pítris become filled with fear. The deities also become highly dissatisfied with him. Gifted with great energy, Fire refuses to accept the libations poured by him.</p>
<p id='24'>आजन्मनां शतं चैव नरके पच्यते तु सः। निष्कृतिं च न तस्यापि अनुमन्यन्ति कर्हिचित्॥<br />For a hundred lives he has to rot in Hell. He is never rescued at any time.</p>
<p id='25'>तस्माद् गावो न पादेन स्प्रष्टव्या वै कदाचन। ब्राह्मणश्च महातेजा दीप्यमानस्तथानलः॥ श्रद्वधानेन मर्येन आत्मनो हितमिच्छता। एते दोषा मया प्रोक्तास्त्रिषु यः पादमुत्सृजेत्॥<br />One should, therefore, never touch a cow with his feet or a Brahmana of high energy or a burning fire, if he is gifted with faith and seeks his own behoof. These are the demerits declared by me of one who lifts up his feet towards these three.</p>
<p id='26'>विश्वामित्र उवाच श्रूयतां परमं गुह्यं रहस्यं धर्मसंहितम्। परमान्नेन यो दद्यात् पितॄणामौपहारिकम्॥ गजच्छायायां पूर्वस्यां कुतपे दक्षिणामुखः। यदा भाद्रपदे मासि भवते बहुले मघा॥ श्रूयतां तस्य दानस्य यादृशो गुणविस्तरः। कृतं तेन महच्छ्राद्धं वर्षाणीह त्रयोदश॥<br />Vishwamitra said Listen to a great mystery that is unknown to most of men and which is connected with religion. He, who offers to the departed manes, rice boiled in milk and sugar, sitting with face directed to the south at noontide, in the shade caused by an elephant's body in the month of Bhadrapada, under the constellation Magha, acquires great merits. Hear of those merits. The man who makes such an offering to the Pitris under such circumstances, is considered as performing a great Shraddha each year for thirteen years successively.</p>
<p id='27'>गाव: ऊचुः बहुले समंगे ह्यकुतोऽभये च क्षेमे च सख्येव हि भूयसी च। यथा पुरा ब्रह्मपुरे सवत्सा शतक्रतोर्वज्रधरस्य यज्ञे।॥ भूयश्च या विष्णुपदे स्थिता ता विभावसोश्चापि पथे स्थिता या। देवाश्च सर्वे सह नारदेन प्रकुर्वते सर्वसहेति नाम॥ मन्त्रेणैतेनाभिवन्देत यो वै विमुच्यते पापकृतेन कर्मणा। लोकानवाप्नोति पुरंदरस्य गवां फलं चन्द्रमसो द्युतिं च<br />The Kine said That man becomes purged off of all his sins who worships a cow with these Mantras. viz., O Bahula, O Samanga, O you who are fearless everywhere, O you who are forgiving and full of auspiciousness, O friend, O source of all plenty, in the region of Brahman, formerly you were present with your calf in the sacrifice of Indra the holder of the thunderbolt! You were stationed in the sky and in the path of Agni! The celestials with Narada among them worshipped you on that occasion by calling you Sarvamsaha! Such a man attains to the region of Purandara. He acquires, besides, the merits that belong to kine, and the splendour of the Moon also.</p>
<p id='28'>एतं हि मन्त्रं त्रिदशभिजुष्टं पठेत यः पर्वसु गोष्ठमध्ये। न तस्य पापं न भयं न शोकः सहस्रनेत्रस्य च याति लोकम्॥<br />Such a man becomes freed from every sin, every fear, every grief. At the end, he acquires residence in the happy region of the Thousand eyed Indra.</p>
<p id='29'>भीष्म उवाच अथ सप्त महाभाग ऋषयो लोकविश्रुताः। वसिष्ठप्रमुखः सर्वे ब्रह्माणं पद्मसम्भवम्॥<br />Bhishma said After this, the highly blessed and illustrious seven Rishis headed by Vashishtha, rose and going round the Louts-born Brahman stood around him with hands joined in respect.</p>
<p id='30'>प्रदक्षिणमभिक्रम्य सर्वे प्राञ्जलयः स्थिताः। उवाच वचनं तेषां वसिष्ठो ब्रह्मावित्तमः॥<br />Vashishtha, that foremost of all persons conversant with Brahma became their spokesman and put this question which conduces to the behoof of all creatures but especially to the Brahmanas and Kshatriyas.</p>
<p id='31'>सर्वप्राणिहितं प्रश्न ब्रह्मक्षत्रे विशेषतः। द्रव्यहीनाः कथं मा दरिद्राः साधुवर्तिनः॥<br />By doing what acts may virtuous men who have no worldly belongings succeed in acquiring the merits of sacrifices?</p>
<p id='32'>प्राप्नुवन्तीह यज्ञस्य फलं केन च कर्मणा। एतच्छ्रुत्वा वचस्तेषां ब्रह्मा वचनमब्रवीत्॥<br />Hearing this question of theirs the Grandfather Brahman began to say what follows.</p>
<p id='33'>ब्राह्मण उवाच अहो प्रश्नो महाभागा गूढार्थः परमः शुभः। सूक्ष्मः श्रेयांश्च मर्त्यानां भवद्भिः समुदाहृतः॥<br />Brahman said Excellent is this question, you highly blessed ones! It is at once auspicious and high and full of mystery. This question that you have put is subtile and conduces to the wellbeing of mankind.</p>
<p id='34'>श्रूयतां सर्वमाख्यास्ये निखिलेन तपोधनाः। यथा यज्ञफलं मो लभते नात्र संशयः॥<br />You Rishis having penances for wealth, I shall recite everything to you in full. Do you listen with attention to what I say as to how men acquire the merits of sacrifices.</p>
<p id='35'>पौषमासस्य शुक्ले वै यदा युज्येत रोहिणी। तेन नक्षत्रयोगेन आकाशशयनो भवेत्॥ एकवस्त्रः शुचिः स्नातः श्रद्दधानः समाहितः। सोमस्य रश्मयः पीत्वा महायज्ञफलं लभेत्॥<br />In the lighted fortnight of the month of Pausha, when the constellation Rohini is in conjunction, if one purifying himself by a bath lies, under the canopy of heaven clad in a single piece of cloth, with faith and rapt attention, and drinks the rays of the Moon, he wins the merits of great sacrifices,</p>
<p id='36'>एतद् वः परमं गुह्यं कथितं द्विजसत्तमाः। यन्मां भवन्तः पृच्छन्ति सूक्ष्मतत्त्वार्थदर्शिनः॥<br />You foremost of twice born persons, this is a great mystery that I declare it to you in reply to your question, you who know the truths of all subjects. attention, and drinks the rays of the Moon, he wins the merits of great sacrifices,</p>
<p id='37'>एतद् वः परमं गुह्यं कथितं द्विजसत्तमाः। यन्मां भवन्तः पृच्छन्ति सूक्ष्मतत्त्वार्थदर्शिनः॥<br />You foremost of twice born persons, this is a great mystery that I declare it to you in reply to your question, you who know the truths of all subjects.</p>
