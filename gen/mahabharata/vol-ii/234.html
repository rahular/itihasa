<h3>DRAUPADI SATYABHAMA SAMVADA PARVA: Chapter 234</h3><h4>The words of Draupadi</h4><p id='1'>द्रौपद्युवाच इमं तु ते मार्गमपेतमोहं वक्ष्यामि चित्तग्रहणाय भर्तुः। अस्मिन् यथावत् सखि वर्तमाना भर्तारमाच्छेत्स्यसि कामिनीभ्यः॥<br />Draupadi said: I shall now point out to you a way for attracting the hearts of your husband which is free from deceit. O friend, by duly adopting it, you will be able to withdraw your husband from other women.</p>
<p id='2'>नैतादृशं दैवतमस्ति सत्ये सर्वेषु लोकेषु सदेवकेषु। यथा पतिस्तस्य त सर्वकाम लभ्याः प्रसादात् कुपितश्च हन्यात्॥<br />O Satyabhama, in all the worlds including that of the celestials, there is no god equal to the husband. When gratified with you, you may get (from your husband) ever object of desire, but when angry, all of them may be lost.</p>
<p id='3'>तस्मादपत्यं विविधाश्च भोगाः शय्यासनान्युत्तमदर्शनानि। वस्त्राणि माल्यानि तथैव गन्धाः स्वर्गश्च लोको विपुला च कीर्तिः॥<br />It is from her husband that the wife obtains offspring and various articles of enjoyments. From your husband you may have handsome beds and seats, robes and garlands, perfumes and great fame and heaven itself hereafter.</p>
<p id='4'>सुखं सुखेनेह न जातु लभ्यं दुःखेन साध्वी लभते सुखानि। सा कृष्णमाराधय सौहदेन प्रेम्णा च नित्यं प्रतिकर्मणा च॥<br />One cannot obtain happiness here by means that are easy. The woman that is chaste obtains happiness with great misery. Therefore always adore Krishna with friendship, love and sufferings.</p>
<p id='5'>र्दाक्षिण्ययोगैर्विविधैश्च गन्धैः। अस्याः प्रियोऽस्मीति यथा विदित्वा त्वामेव संश्लिष्यति तद् विधस्त्व॥<br />Act in such a way by offering handsome seats and excellent garlands and various perfumes and prompt service that he may be devoted to you, thinking, "I am truly loved by her."</p>
<p id='6'>श्रुत्वा स्वरं द्वारगतस्य भर्तुः प्रत्युत्थिता तिष्ठ गृहस्य मध्ये। दृष्ट्वा प्रविष्टं त्वरिताऽऽसनेन पायेन चैनं प्रतिपूजयस्व॥<br />Hearing the voice of your husband at the gate, rise from your seat and stay in readiness within the room. As soon as you see him enter your room, worship him by offering him a seat and water to wash his feet.</p>
<p id='7'>मुत्थाय सर्वं स्वयमेव कार्यम्। जानातु कृष्णस्तव भावमेतं सर्वात्मना मां भजतीति सत्ये॥<br />O Satyabhama, when he orders a maidservant to do any thing, soon get up and do it yourself. Let Krishna know that you adore him with all your heart.</p>
<p id='8'>त्वत्संनिधौ यत् कथयेत् पतिस्ते यद्यप्यगुह्यं परिरक्षितव्यम्। काचित् सपत्नी तव वासुदेवं प्रत्यादिशेत् तेन भवेद् विरागः॥<br />Whatever your husband speaks before you, do not speak it out to every body, though it does not deserve to be concealed, for if any of your co-wives is to speak of it Vasudeva (Krishna), he might be irritated with you.</p>
<p id='9'>स्तान् भोजयेथा विविधैरुपायैः। द्वेष्यैरुपेक्ष्यैरहितैश्च तस्य भिद्यस्व नित्यं कुहकोद्यतैश्च॥<br />Always seek the good of your husband and feed by every means in your power those that are dear and devoted to him. You should always keep yourself aloof from those that are hostile to your husband or those who seek to do him injury and those that are deceitful.</p>
<p id='10'>मदं प्रमादं पुरुषेषु हित्वा संयच्छ भावं प्रतिगृह्य मौनम्। प्रद्युम्नसाम्बावपि ते कुमारी नोपासितव्यौ रहिते कदाचित्॥<br />Avoiding all excitement and carelessness in the presence of men, conceal your mind by observing silence. You should not stay or talk long even with your sons Pradyumna and Samba.</p>
<p id='11'>महाकुलीनाभिरपापिकाभिः स्त्रीभिः सतीभिस्तव सख्यमस्तु। चण्डाश्च शौण्डाश्च महाशनाश्च चौराश्च दुष्टाश्चपलाश्च वाः॥<br />You should make friendship with only those ladies who are highly born, who are sinless and devoted to their husbands; you should always shun women who are wrathful, addicted to drinks, gluttonous, thievish, wicked and fickle.</p>
<p id='12'>एतद् यशस्यं भगदैवतं च स्वार्थं तथा शत्रुनिबर्हणं च। महार्हमाल्याभरणाङ्गरागा भर्तारमाराधय पुण्यगन्धा॥<br />Such conduct is always praiseworthy and it always produces prosperity. While it neutralizes hostility, it also leads one to heaven. Therefore worship your husband, adorning yourself with costly garments and ornaments and besmearing yourself with unguents and perfumes.</p>
