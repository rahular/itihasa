Its branches are unending and represent the luxuries and the words etc. are the fragrant giving the material pleasures added with this tree. The root to that cosmos formed tree is Avidya (ignorance). A number of reverse flowing continuously are in the form of temptation and luxuries. These rivers are emanated from the root of that ignorance. These rivers appear attractive having pure water with fragrance extraneously and float the satiating matters like water and as sweet as honey.</p>
<p id='29'>शाखां शाखां महानद्यः संयान्ति सिकताशयाः। धानापूपा मांसशाकाः सदा पायसकर्दमाः॥<br />However, these all are incapable to give any fruitful result like fried barley, field with a number of pores like sweet bread, impure as the flesh, void like dry vegetable and generate malice to the heart and mind not lesser than marsh inspite of appearing like sweet dish, These are distinct to each other like sand particles and these flow inside the branches of that cane tree (Calamus).</p>
