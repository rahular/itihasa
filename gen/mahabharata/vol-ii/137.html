<h3>TIRTHAYATRA PARVA: Chapter 137</h3><h4>History of Yavakrit</h4><p id='1'>लोमश उवाच भरद्वाजस्तु कौन्तेय कृत्वा स्वाध्यायमाछिकम्। समित्कलापमादाय प्रविवेश स्वमाश्रयम्॥<br />Lomasha said: O son of Kunti, having collected the sacrificial fuel and after performing the ritual duties of the day Bharadvaja entered his hermitage.</p>
<p id='2'>तं स्म दृष्टवा सर्वे प्रत्युत्तिष्ठन्ति पावकाः। न त्वेनमुपतिष्ठन्ति हतपुत्रं तदाग्नथः॥<br />As his son was killed, the (sacrificial) fire, which used to welcome him every day, did not come that day to welcome him.</p>
<p id='3'>वैकृतं त्वग्निहोत्रे स लक्षयित्वा महातपाः। तमन्धं शूद्रमासीनं गृहपालमथाब्रवीत्॥<br />Having seen this change in the Agnihotra, that great ascetic thus spoke to that blind Shudra gate-keeper who was seated there.</p>
<p id='4'>किं नु मे नाग्नयः शूद्र प्रतिनन्दन्ति दर्शनम्। त्वं चापि न यथापूर्वं कच्चित् क्षेममिहाश्रमे॥<br />"O Shudra, why does not the fire delight on seeing me? You too do not express delight as you always do? Is everything well in the hermitage?</p>
<p id='5'>कम्चिन्न रैभ्यं पुत्रो मे गतवानल्पचेतनः। एतदाचक्ष्व मे शीघ्रं न हि शुद्ध्यति मे मनः॥<br />I hope my foolish son had not gone to Raivya? Tell me all this quickly; misgivings fill my mind</p>
<p id='6'>शूद्र उवाच रैभ्यं यातो नूनमयं पुत्रस्ते मन्दचेतनः। तथा हि निहतः शेते राक्षसेन बलीयसा॥<br />Shudra said: Your foolish son went to the great sage and therefore he lies prostrate being killed by a powerful Rakshasha.</p>
<p id='7'>प्रकाल्यमानस्तेनायं शृलहप्तेन रक्षसा। अग्न्यागारं प्रति द्वारि मया दोऱ्यां निवारितः॥<br />He was pursued by a Rakshasha with uplifted spear; and he attempted to enter this room, but he was stopped at the door by me.</p>
<p id='8'>ततः स विहताशोऽत्र जलकामोऽशुचिर्भुवम्। निहतः सोऽतिवेगेन शूलहस्तेन रक्षसा॥<br />Thereupon being desirous to obtain water (in this room) in an unclean state, (he tried to force a passage, but his way being barred with my arms), he stood hopeless and (at that state) he was killed by the Rakshasha who held a spear in his hand.</p>
<p id='9'>भरद्वाजस्तु तच्छ्रुत्वा शूद्रस्य विप्रियं महत्। गतासुं पुत्रमादाय विललाप सुदुःखितः॥<br />Lomasha said: Having hcard from the Shudra, of this great calamity, Bharadvaja, embracing his dead son, began to lament for him.</p>
<p id='10'>भरद्वाज उवाच ब्राह्मणानां किलार्थाय ननु त्वं तप्तवांस्तपः। द्विजानामनधीता वै वेदाः सम्प्रतिभान्त्विति॥<br />Bharadvaja said : For the good of the Brahmana you performed the severe austerities, so that the Vedas unstudied by any Brahmanas might be manifest in you.</p>
<p id='11'>तथा कल्याणशीलस्त्वं ब्राह्मणेषु महात्मसु। अनागाः सर्वभूतेषु कर्कशत्वमुपेयिवान्॥<br />Your conduct towards the Brahmanas had always been for their good and you had been always innocent in regard to all creatures. But at last you turned to be rude.</p>
<p id='12'>प्रतिषिद्धो मया तात रैभ्यावसथदर्शनात्। गतवानेव तं द्रष्टुं कालान्तकयमोपमम्॥<br />O child, I prohibited you from visiting the residence of Raivya, but you went there to visit it which was like the all-destroying death.</p>
<p id='13'>यः स जानन महातेजा वृद्धस्यैकं ममात्मजम्। गतवानेव कोपस्य वशं परमदुर्मतिः॥<br />That greatly effulgent one knows me to be old and (he knew also) that I had only one son. But that wicked-minded one still became subject to anger.</p>
<p id='14'>पुत्रशोकमनुप्राप्त एष रैभ्यस्य कर्मणा। त्यक्ष्यामि त्वामृते पुत्र प्राणानिष्टतमान् भुवि॥<br />I have been afflicted with the grief at my son's death on account of Raivya. O son, for your death I shall give up my life which is the most precious thing in the world.</p>
<p id='15'>यथाहं पुत्रशोकेन देहं त्यक्ष्यामि किल्विषी। तथा ज्येष्ठः सुतो रैभ्यं हिंस्याच्छीघ्रमनागसम्॥<br />As I give up my life on account of the gricf at the death of my son, so will the eldest son of Raivya kill him, though he would be innocent.</p>
<p id='16'>सुखिनो वै नरा येषां जात्या पुत्रो न विद्यते। ते पुत्रशोकमप्राप्य विचरन्ति यथासुखम्॥<br />Happy are those to whom children are never born! Without experiencing the grief at their son's death, they happily move about.</p>
<p id='17'>ये तु पुत्रकृताच्छोकाद् भृशं व्याकुलचेतसः। शपन्तीष्टान् सखीनार्तास्तेभ्यः पापतरो नु कः॥<br />Who can in this world be more sinful than those, who from the grief at their son's death and thus becoming deprived of their sense, curse their dearest friends?</p>
<p id='18'>परासुश्च सुतो दृष्टः शप्तश्चेष्टः सखा मया। ईदृशीमापदं कोऽत्र द्वितीयोऽनुभविष्यति॥<br />Having seen my son dead, I have cursed my dearest friend. What second man is there who mects with such a (grcat) calamity.</p>
<p id='19'>लोमश उवाच विलप्यैवं बहुविधं भरद्वाजोऽदहत् सुतम्। सुसमिद्धं ततः पश्चात् प्रविवेश हुताशनम्॥<br />Lomasha said : Having thus variously lamented for his son, Bharadvaja cremated him and then he himself entered a blazing fire.</p>
