<p id='2'>तान् दृष्ट्वा द्रवतः सर्वान् धार्तराष्ट्रान् पराङ्मुखान्। दुर्योधनो महाराजो नासीत् तत्र पराङ्मुखः॥<br />Seeing all the Kuru soldiers flying from the enemy, the great king Duryodhana refused to run away.</p>
<p id='3'>तामापतन्ती सम्प्रेक्ष्य गन्धर्वाणां महाचमूम्। महता शरवर्षेण सोऽभ्यवर्षदरिंदमः॥<br />Seeing the greatly powerful Gandharva army rushing towards him, that chastiser of foes hurled on them a thick shower of arrows.</p>

<p id='5'>युगमीषां वरूथं च तथैव ध्वजसारथी। अश्वांस्त्रिवेणुं तल्पं च तिलशो व्यधमञ्छरैः॥ दुर्योधनं चित्रसेनो विरथं पतितं भुवि। अभिद्रुत्य महाबाहुर्जीवग्राहमथाग्रहीत्॥<br />With their arrows, they cut off into pieces its yoke, shafts, fenders, the flag-staff, threefold bamboo poles and the chief turret. They also cut off his charioteer and horses. When Duryodhana thus deprived to his car fell on the ground, the mighty-armed Chitrasena rushed upon him and seized him with such force that it seemed as if his life itself was taken.</p>
<p id='6'>तस्मिन् गृहीते राजेन्द्र स्थितं दुःशासनं रथे। पर्यगृह्णन्त गन्धर्वाः परिवार्य समन्ततः॥<br />O king of kings, when he was thus taken prisoner, the Gandharvas surrounded the car on which Duhshasana was seated; and they took him also as a prisoner.</p>

<p id='8'>सैन्यं तद् धार्तराष्ट्रस्य गन्धर्वैः समभिद्रुतम्। पूर्वं प्रभग्नाः सहिताः पाण्डवानभ्ययुस्तदा॥<br />The soldiers of the son of Dhritarashtra who were routed by the Gandharvas then came to the Pandavas.</p>
<p id='9'>शकटापणवेशाश्च यानयुग्यं च सर्वशः। शरणं पाण्डवाञ्जग्मुह्रियमाणे महीपतौ।॥<br />When the king (Duryodhana) was taken prisoner, the vehicles, the shops, the pavilions, the conveyances and the beasts of burden were all made over to the Pandavas for protection. some</p>
<p id='10'>सैनिका ऊचुः प्रियदर्शी महाबाहुर्धार्तराष्ट्रो महाबलः। गन्धर्वैह्रियते राजा पार्थास्तमनुधावत॥<br />The soldiers said: The handsome, the mighty-armed and the greatly powerful son of Dhritarashtra (Duryodhana) is taken away by the Gandharvas as prisoner. O sons of Pritha, follow them.</p>
<p id='11'>दुःशासनो दुर्विषहो दुर्मुखो दुर्जयस्तथा। बद्ध्वा ह्रियन्ते गन्धर्वै राजदाराश्च सर्वशः॥<br />Duhshasana, Durvisha, Durmukha and Durjaya are all being led away as prisoners bound in chains and also the ladies of the royal household.</p>
<p id='12'>इति दुर्योधनामात्याः क्रोशन्तो राजगृद्धिनः। आर्ता दीनाप्ततः सर्वे युधिष्ठिरमुपागमन्॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Thus crying, the followers of Duryodhana, afflicted with grief and sorrow, came to Yudhishthira desiring to effect the rescue of their king.</p>
<p id='13'>तांस्तथा व्यथितान् दीनान् भिक्षमाणान् युधिष्ठिरम्। वृद्धान् दुर्योधनामात्यान् भीमसेनोऽभ्यभाषत॥<br />Then to those old counsellors of Duryodhana who came, in grief and being melancholy, ask protection from Yudhishthira, Bhimsena said,</p>
<p id='14'>महता हि प्रयत्नेन संना गजवाजिभिः। अस्माभिर्यदनुष्ठेयं गन्धर्वैस्तदनुष्ठितम्॥<br />"That, we ought to have done with great efforts arriving ourselves in the line of battle, supported by horses and elephants has indeed been done (today) by the Gandharvas.</p>
<p id='15'>अन्यथा वर्तमानानामर्थो जातोऽयमन्यथा। दुर्मन्त्रितमिदं तावद् राज्ञो दुर्दूतदेविनः॥<br />They that came here with other purposes have been overtaken by consequences which they have not foreseen. This is the result of the c'il counsus of a king who is fond of gambling.</p>
<p id='16'>द्वेष्टारमन्ये क्लीबस्य पातयन्तीति नः श्रुतम्। इदं कृतं नः प्रत्यक्षं गन्धर्वैरतिमानुषम्॥<br />It has been heard by us that even the enemy of a inan who is powerful is overthrown by to others. the Gandharvas have done this extraordinary feat before our very eyes.</p>
<p id='17'>दिष्ट्या लोके पुमानस्ति कश्चिदस्मत्प्रिये स्थितः। येनास्माकं हृतो भार आसीनानां सुखावहः॥<br />There is in the world still fortunately (for us) some who is desirous of doing us good and who has taken upon his shoulder our pleasant load.</p>
<p id='18'>शीतवातातपसहांस्तपसा चैव कर्शितान्। समस्थो विषमस्थान् हि द्रष्टुमिच्छति दुर्मतिः॥<br />The wicked-minded wretch had come here to us, himself being in prosperity, while we are now sunk in misery, being emaciated by severe austerities and exposed to wind, cold and heat.</p>
<p id='19'>अधर्मचारिणस्तस्य कौरव्यस्य दुरात्मनः। ये शीलमनुवर्तन्ते ते पश्यन्ति पराभवम्॥<br />Those that imitate the conduct of that sinful and wicked Kuru (Duryodhana) are now seeing his own disgrace.</p>
<p id='20'>अधर्मो हि कृतस्तेन येनैतदुपशिक्षितम्। अनृशंसास्तु कौन्तेयास्तत् प्रत्यक्षं ब्रवीमि वः॥<br />He who instructed Duryodhana to do this had certainly acted sinfully. I tell you, the sons of Kunti are not wicked and sinful."</p>
<p id='21'>एवं ब्रुवाणं कौन्तेयं भीमसेनमपस्वरम्। न काल: परुषस्यायमिति राजाभ्यभाषत॥<br />When the son of Kunti Bhimasena was thus talking in a voice of sarcasm, the king (Yudhishthira) said, “This is not the time for using cruel words.”</p>
