<h3>NALOPAKHYANA PARVA: Chapter 7O</h3><h4>The declaration of Damayanti's second Svayamvara</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>बृहदश्व उवाच अथ दीर्घस्य कालस्य पर्णादो नाम वै द्विजः। प्रत्येत्य नगरं भैमीमिदं वचनमब्रवीत्॥<br />Brihadashva said : After a very long time, a Brahmana, Parnada by name, came back to the city of the king of the Vidharbhas and spoke to the daughter of king Bhima these words:</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>नैषधं मृगयानेन दमयन्ति मया नलम्। अयोध्या नगरी गत्वा भाङ्गासुरिमुपस्थितः॥<br />“O Damayanti, searching Nala, the king of the Nishadhas, at last I went to the city of the Ayodhya and presented myself to Vangasuri.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>श्रावितश्च मया वाक्यं त्वदीयं स महाजने। ऋतुपर्णो महाभागो यथोक्तं वरवर्णिनि॥ तच्छुत्वा नाब्रवीत् किंचिदृतुपर्णो नराधिपः। न च पारिषदः कश्चिद् भाष्यमाणो मयासकृत्॥<br />O fair-complexioned one, O best of women, I recited the very words of yours before that illustrious Rituparna. Hearing these words, which I had repeatedly uttered to them, neither king Rituparna, nor any one of his courtiers, said anything in reply.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>अनुज्ञातं तु मां राज्ञा विजने कश्चिदब्रवीत्। ऋतुपर्णस्य पुरुषो बाहुको नाम नामतः॥<br />When I was dismissed by the king, some person in the service of Rituparna, Bahuka by name, told me in private.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>सूतस्तस्य नरेन्द्रस्य विरूपो ह्रस्वबाहुकः। शीघ्रयानेषु कुशलो मृष्टकर्ता च भोजने॥<br />That Bahuka is the charioteer of that foremost of monarchs. He is also possessed of extraordinary appearance and short arms; and is skilled in driving with speed and also in cooking sweet food.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>स विनिःश्वस्य बहुशो रुदित्वा च पुनः पुनः। कुशलं चैव मां पृष्ट्वा पश्चादिदमभाषत।॥<br />Sighing heavily and frequently and weeping incessantly, he asked about my welfare; and then addressed me with these words:</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>वैषम्यमपि सम्प्राप्ता गोपायन्ति कुलस्त्रियः। आत्मानमात्मना सत्यो जित: स्वर्गो न संशयः॥<br />'Although fallen into great calamity, the chaste women guard themselves by their own efforts; and thus undoubtedly obtain heaven (heavenly blessings).</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>रहिता भर्तृभिश्चैव न कुप्यन्ति कदाचन। प्राणांश्चारित्रकवचान्धारयन्ति वरस्त्रियः॥<br />Again, chaste women, even if they be forsaken by their husbands, do never become angry (with them); rather they hold their lives shielded by virtuous behaviours.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>विषमस्थेन मूढेन परिभ्रष्टसुखेन च। यत् सा तेन परित्यक्ता तत्र न क्रोद्भुमर्हति॥<br />She should not be angry, forsaken as she was by a person, who himself was foolish, overtaken by distress and also destitute of all happiness.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>प्राणयात्रां परिप्रेप्सोः शकुनैर्हतवाससः। आधिभिर्दह्यमानस्य श्यामा न क्रोद्भुमर्हति॥<br />It behoves the lady of unchanging youth not to be angry with a person, who was deprived to his cloth by a bird while trying for sustenance (in the forest); and also who was burning with woe.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>सत्कृतासत्कृता वापि पतिं दृष्ट्वा तथागतम्। भ्रष्टराज्यं श्रिया हीनं क्षुधितं व्यसनाप्लुतम्॥<br />Also, it behoves the lady, treated fairly or unfairly, not to be angry with her husband, seeing him in that miserable condition, in which he was deprived of both wealth and kingdom and oppressed with hunger and overwhelmed with distress.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>तस्य तद् वचनं श्रुत्वा त्वरितोऽहमिहागतः। श्रुत्वा प्रमाणं भवती राज्ञश्चैव निवेदय॥<br />Hearing these words of his, I instantly came here. Do you, therefore, inform the king all about these words, which you have heard.”</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>एतच्छ्रुत्वाश्रुपूर्णाक्षी पर्णादस्य विशाम्पते। दमयन्ती रहोऽभ्येत्य मातरं प्रत्यभाषत॥<br />O monarch, hearing these words of Parnada, Damayanti, with her eyes filled with tears, repaired to her mother and said to her these words,</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>अयमर्थो न संवेद्यो भीमे मातः कदाचन। त्वत्संनिधौ नियोक्ष्येऽहं सुदेवं द्विजसत्तमम्॥ यथा न नृपतिर्भीमः प्रतिपद्येत मे मतम्। तथा त्वया प्रकर्तव्यं मम चेत् प्रियमिच्छसि॥<br />"O mother, let not king Bhima, by any means, know my object. I like to employ that foremost of the Brahmanas, Sudeva, in your presence. Should you desire my welfare, do you act in such a manner that king Bhima will not come to know this purpose of mine.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>यथा चाहं समानीता सुदेवेनाशु बान्धवान्। तेनैव मङ्गलेनाशु सुदेवो यातु मा चिरम्॥ समानेतुं नलं मातरयोध्यां नगरीमितः।<br />Let Sudeva go at once, with the performance of the same auspicious ceremonies, by the doing of which I was brought to my relatives instantly by him. O mother, let him go hence to the city of Ayodhya in order to bring Nala here."</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>विश्रान्तं तु ततः पश्चात् पर्णादं द्विजसत्तमम्॥ अर्चयामास वैदर्भाधनेनातीव भाविनी। नले चेहागते तत्र भूयो दास्यामि ते वसु॥<br />Thereupon the beauteous lady, the daughter of the king of the Vidharbhas, worshipped, with the bestowal of immense riches, the foremost of the regenerate ones, who has now taken perfect rest. And she said to him, “O Brahmana, I will, again, give you much wealth at the arrival of Nala here.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>त्वया हि मे बहु कृतं यदन्यो न करिष्यति। यद् भाहं समेष्यामि शीघ्रमेव द्विजोत्तम॥<br />O foremost of the regenerate ones, indeed you have done much for me, which none else will do; and for this reason only that I will soon regain my husband.”</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>स एवमुक्तोऽथाश्वास्य आशीर्वादैः सुमङ्गलैः। गृहानुपययौ चापि कृतार्थः सुमहामनाः॥<br />Thus addressed by her, that high-souled Brahmana solaced Damayanti by the expression of auspicious benedictions, and then he returned home, thinking himself successful in his endeavours.</p>

<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>गत्वा सुदेव नगरीमयोध्यावासिनं नृपम्। ऋतुपर्णं वचो ब्रूहि सम्पतन्निव कामगः॥<br />“O Sudeva, like a bird which falls straight, do you at once depart to the city of Ayodhya and tell king Ritupara, Who dwells in it, these words:</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>आस्थास्यति पुनर्भमी दमयन्ती स्वयंवरम्। तत्र गच्छन्ति राजानो राजपुत्राश्च सर्वशः॥<br />'Damayanti, the daughter of king Bhima, will again hold the Svayamvara, to which all the kings and princes are rushing from all directions.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>तथा च गणितः कालः श्वोभूते स भविष्यति। यदि सम्भावनीयं ते गच्छ शीघ्रमरिंदम्॥<br />Calculating the time, this will beheld tomorrow. So, if possible, O chastiser of foes, go at once.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>सूर्योदये द्वितीयं सा भर्तारं वरयिष्यति। न हि स ज्ञायते वीरो नलो जीवति वा न वा॥<br />At the next sun-rise she will accept a second husband; as it is not known whether heroic Nala is still living or otherwise.'</p>
