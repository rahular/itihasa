<h3>TIRTHAYATRA PARVA: Chapter 112</h3><h4>History of Rishyashringa</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>ऋष्यशृङ्ग उवाच इहागतो जटिलो ब्रह्मचारी न वै ह्रस्वो नातिदीर्घो मनस्वी। सुवर्णवर्ण: कमलायताक्षः स्वतः सुराणामिव शोभमानः॥<br />Rishyashringa said : Here came a Brahmachari with masses of hair on his head. That intelligent one was neither short nor tall. His complexion was like gold; his expansive eyes were like the lotus. He was as blazing and beautiful as a celestials.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>समृद्धरूपः सवितेव दीप्तः सुश्लक्ष्णकृष्णाक्षिरतीव गौरः। नीलः प्रसन्नाश्च जटाः सुगन्धा हिरण्यरज्जुग्रथिताः सुदीर्घाः॥<br />His exceeding beauty was blazing like the sun, his eyes were very graceful and black. His matted locks were blue, fragrant, long and tied up with strings of gold.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>आश्चर्यरूपा पुनरस्य कण्ठे विभ्राजते विद्युदिवान्तरिक्षे। दजातरोमौ सुमनोहरौ च॥<br />A beautiful ornament was shining round his neck; it looked like the lightning in the sky. Under the throat (on his breast) he had two fleshy hairless and exceedingly beautiful balls.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>विलग्नमध्यश्च स नाभिदेशे कटिश्च तस्यातिकृतप्रमाणा। तथास्य चीरान्तरतः प्रभाति हिरण्मयी मेखला मे यथेयम्॥<br />His waist was slender, his navel heat and region about the ribs smooth. There shone a golden string from under his cloth like this waist string of mine.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>अन्यच्च तस्याद्भुतदर्शनीयं विकूजितं पादयोः सम्प्रभाति। पाण्योश्च तद्वत् स्वनवन्निबद्धौ कलापकावक्षमाला यथेयम्॥<br />There was on his feet something of a wonderful shape which gave forth a jingling sound. There were also ornaments tied upon his wrists that made a similar sound; they looked like this rosary here.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>विचेष्टमानस्य च तस्य तानि कूजन्ति हंसाः सरसीव मत्ताः। चीराणि तस्याद्भुतदर्शनानि नेमानि तद्वन्मम रूपवन्ति॥<br />When he moved about, those ornaments made the sound as that of delightful swans on the waters of a tank. His clothes were of extraordinary make; my clothes are not so beautiful as his.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>वक्त्रं च तस्याद्भुतदर्शनीयं प्रव्याहृतं ह्लादयतीव चेतः। पुंस्कोकिलस्येव च तस्य वाणी तां शृण्वतो मे व्यथितोऽन्तरात्मा।॥<br />His face was of extraordinary beauty, his voice gladdened the heart. His words were like the voice of male Kokilas, hearing which I felt it to my innermost heart.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>यथा वनं माधवमासि मध्ये समीरितं श्वसनेनेव भाति। तथा स भात्युत्तमपुण्यगन्धी निषेव्यमाणः पवनेन तात॥<br />As the forest in the midst of the vernal season assumed a beauty when fanned by the breeze, O sire, so that excellent and fragrant one assumes a beauty when fanned by the breeze.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>सुसंयताश्चापि जटा विषक्ता द्वैधीकृता नातिसमा ललाटे। कर्णौ च चित्रैरिव चक्रवाकैः समावृतौ तस्य सुरूपवद्भिः॥<br />Her massy hair is neatly tied unto they stuck to the head and forehead evenly divided in two. His two eyes seemed to be covered by wonderful and exceedingly beautiful Chakravaka (birds).</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>तथा फलं वृत्तमथो विचित्रं समाहरत् पाणिना दक्षिणेन। तद् भूमिमासाद्य पुनः पुनश्च समुत्पतत्यद्भुतरूपमुच्चैः॥<br />He carried in his right hand a wonderful globular fruit which reached the ground and again and again rose up to the sky in a wonderful way.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>तच्चाभिहत्य परिवर्ततेऽसौ वातेरितो वृक्ष इवावघूर्णन्। तं प्रेक्षतः पुत्रमिवामराणां प्रीतिः परा तात रतिश्च जाता॥<br />He beat it and turned himself round; he whirled like a tree moved by the breeze. O sire, when I looked at him, he seemed to me a son of the immortals. My joy was extreme and I felt great pleasure.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>स मे समाश्लिष्य पुनः शरीरं जटासु गृह्याभ्यवनाम्य वक्त्रम्। वक्त्रेण वक्त्रं प्रणिधाय शब्द चकार तन्मेऽजनयत् प्रहर्षम्॥<br />He clasped my body; he took hold of my matted hair and he bent down my mouth; mingling his mouth with mine, he uttered a sound which gave me great pleasure.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>न चापि पाद्यं बहु मन्यतेऽसौ फलानि चेमानि मयाऽऽहतानि। एवंव्रतोऽस्मीति च मामवोचत् फलानि चान्यानि समाददन्मे।॥<br />He did not care for water to wash his feet or for fruits offered by me to him. He told me such was the religious observance practised by him. He gave me other fruits.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>मयोपयुक्तनि फलानि यानि नेमानि तुल्यानि रसेन तुषाम्। न चापि तेषां त्वगियं यथैषां साराणि नैषामिव सन्ति तेषाम्॥<br />Those fruits were tasted by me. These (fruits here) are not equal to them in taste. Those (given by him) had neither rind nor stone as these (fruits here) have.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>तोयानि चैवातिरसानि मह्यं प्रादात् स व पातुमुदाररूपः। पीत्वैव यान्यभ्यधिकः प्रहर्षो ममाभवद् भूश्चलितेव चासीत्॥<br />That noble featured one gave me to drink wear of exceedingly fine flavour. Having drunk it, I experienced great pleasure and I felt as if the ground under my feet was moving away.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>इमानि चित्राणि च गन्धवन्ति माल्यानि तस्योद्चथितानि पट्टैः। यानि प्रकीर्येह गतः स्वमेव स आश्रमं तपसा द्योतमानः॥<br />These are the beautiful and fragrant garlands entwined with silken threads. They belonged to him. Blazing in ascetic merits he scattered these garlands here and he then went back to his own hermitage.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>गतेन तेनास्मि कृतो विचेता गात्रं च मे सम्परिदह्यतीव। इच्छामि तस्यान्तिकमाशु गन्तुं तं चेह नित्यं परिवर्तमानम्॥<br />At his departure my heart has become sad and my body seems to be burning. I desire to go to him as soon as I can. I desire that he should always walk about here.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>गच्छामि तस्यान्तिकमेव तात का नाम सा ब्रह्मचर्या च तस्या इच्छाम्यहं चरितुं तेन साधु यथा तपः स चरत्यार्यधर्मा॥<br />O sire, I shall this very moment go to him. What is the name of the Brahmacharya that is practised by him? I desire to lead the same life with him, the same religious life led by that man of noble virtue.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>चर्तुं तथेच्छा हृदये ममास्ति दुनोति चित्तं यदि तं न पश्ये॥<br />My heart is yearning to practise the same (religious observance). My heart will burn if I do not see him.</p>
