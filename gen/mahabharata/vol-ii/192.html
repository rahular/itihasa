<p id='2'>अथाचष्ट मार्कण्डेयोऽपूर्वमिदं श्रूयतां ब्राह्मणानां चरितम्॥<br />Markandeya replied, “Hear the account of the Brahmanas in the days of old."</p>
<p id='3'>अयोध्यायामिक्ष्वाकुकुलोद्वहः पार्थिवः परिक्षिन्नाम मृगयामगमत्॥<br />Markandeya said : A king of Ayodhya, born in Ikshvaku's dynasty, named Parikshit (once) went out hunting.</p>
<p id='4'>तमेकाश्वेन मृगमनुसरन्तं मृगो दूरमपाहरत्॥<br />Pursuing a deer alone on a single horse he went away to a great distance (from his followers and retinue).</p>
<p id='5'>अध्वनि जातश्रमः क्षुत्तृष्णाभिभूतश्चैकस्मिन् देशे नीलं गहनं वनखण्डमपश्यत्॥<br />Fatigued and afflicted with hunger and thirst, he saw in that part of the country where he was (thus) led, a dark and dense forest.</p>
<p id='6'>तच्च विवेश ततस्तस्य वनखण्डस्य मध्येऽतीव रमणीयं सरो दृष्ट्वा साश्च एव व्यगाहत॥<br />He entered it (the forest). Seeing in the deep forest a charming lake, he with his horse bathed there.</p>
<p id='7'>अथाश्वस्तः स बिसमृणालमश्वायाग्रतो निक्षिप्य पुष्करिणीतीरे संविवेश। ततः शयानो मधुरं गीतमशृणोत्॥<br />Thus being refreshed and placing some lotus-stalks before the horse (for him to eat), he sat on the side of the lake. Lying down there he heard a sweet strain of music.</p>
<p id='8'>स श्रुत्वाचिन्तयन्नेह मनुष्यगतिं पश्यामि कस्य खल्वयं गीतशब्द इति॥<br />Hearing it he reflected, “I do not see any trace of any human being here: whose strain of music is then this?"</p>
<p id='9'>अथापश्यत् कन्यां परमरूपदर्शनीयां पुष्पाण्यवचिन्वन्ती गायन्तीं च। अथ सा राज्ञः समीपे पर्यक्रामत्॥<br />He then saw a damsel of great beauty and grace gathering flowers and singing (as she was doing it). She soon came near the king.</p>
<p id='10'>तामब्रवीद् राजा कस्यासि भद्रे का वा त्वमिति। सा तां प्रत्युवाच कन्या स्मीति राजोवाचार्थी त्वयाहमिति॥<br />To her said he, “O blessed lady, who are you and to whom do you belong?" "She replied, I am a maiden." The king said, “I ask you to be mine."</p>
<p id='11'>अथोवाच कन्या समयेनाहं शक्या त्वया लब्धुं नान्यथेति राजा तां समयमपृच्छत्। कन्योवाच नोदकं मे दर्शयितव्यमिति॥<br />To him replied the maiden, "Give me a pledge, only then I can be yours.” The king asked about the pledge and the maiden said, “I must never sce water."</p>
<p id='12'>स राजा तां बाढमित्युक्त्वा तामुपयेमे कृतोद्वाहश्च राजा परिक्षित् क्रीडपानो मुदा परमया युक्तस्तूष्णीं सङ्गम्य तया सहास्ते॥<br />The king asked, “Be it so" and he then married her. Having married her, the king Parikshit sported with her in great joy and sat with her in silence.</p>
<p id='13'>ततस्तत्रैवासीने राजनि सेनान्वगच्छत्॥<br />When he was thus living, his soldiers arrived at that spot.</p>
<p id='14'>सा सेनोपविष्टं राजानं परिवार्यातिष्ठत्। पर्याश्वस्तश्च राजा तयैव सह शिबिकया प्रायादवघोटितया स स्वं नगरमनुप्राप्य रहसि तया सहास्ते॥<br />Seeing the kings, the soldiers stood surrounded him. Chcered by the arrival of his soldiers, the king entered a Palakin and went to his city. Arriving at his own city, he lived with her in privacy.</p>
<p id='15'>तत्राभ्याशस्थोऽपि कश्चिन्नापश्यदथ प्रधानामात्योऽभ्याशचरास्तस्य स्त्रियोऽपृच्छत्॥ किमत्र प्रयोजनं वर्तते इत्यथाब्रुवंस्ताः स्त्रियः॥<br />Even those who were stationed near him could not see him. Thereupon his chief ininister asked those women that waited upon him, "What is your business?” The women said,</p>
<p id='16'>अपूर्वमिव पश्याम उदकं नात्र नीयत इत्यथामात्योऽनुदकं वनं कारयित्वोदारवृक्षं। बहुपुष्पफलमूलं तस्य मध्ये मुक्ताजालमायीं पार्श्वे वापी गूढां सुधासलिललिप्तां स रहस्युपगम्य राजान-मब्रवीत्॥ वनमिदमुदारकं साध्वत्र रम्यतामिति॥<br />“We see here a matchlessly beautiful damsel and the king has married her giving her a pledge, namely that he would never show her any water." Having heard all this, he (the minister) made an artificial forest containing many trees with numerous fruits and flowers. He excavated a large and deep tank within that forest in one of its corners. He covered it with a net of pearls and its water looked like ambrosia. One day he spoke thus to the king in private. “This is a beautiful forest having no water any where. Sport here in joy."</p>
<p id='17'>स तस्य वचनात् तयैव सह देव्या तद् वनं प्राविशत्। स कदाचित् तस्मिन् कानने रम्ये तयैव सह व्यवाहरदथ क्षुत्तृष्णार्दितः श्रान्तोऽतिमुक्तकागार-मपश्यत्॥<br />At these words of the minister, he (the king) entered that forest with his beautiful wife. One day when he was sporting in that charming forest, he became tired and fatigued and afflicted with hunger and thirst. He then saw a bower of Madhavi (creeper).</p>
<p id='18'>तत् प्रविश्य राजा सह प्रियया सुधाकृतां विमला सलिलपूर्णां वापीमपश्यत्॥ दृष्ट्वैव च तां तस्याश्च तीरे सहैव तया देव्यावातिष्ठत्॥<br />Entering it with his beloved, the king saw a tank full of water which was transparent and which was as sweet as nectar. Seeing it with his beautiful wife, he sat down on its bank.</p>
<p id='19'>अथ तां देवीं राजाब्रवीत् साध्ववतर वापीसलिलमिति। सा तद्वचः श्रुत्वावतीर्य वापी न्यमज्जन्न पुनरुदमज्जत्॥<br />Then the king thus spoke to that lady, “Cheerfully bathe in this water." Having heard his words, she got down under the water, but she did not reappear again.</p>
<p id='20'>तां स मृगयमाणो राजा नापश्यद् वापीमथ निःस्राव्य मण्डूकं श्वभ्रमुखे दृष्ट्वा क्रुद्ध आज्ञापयामास स राजा॥<br />When the king searched for her, he did not find any trace of her. He then ordered the water of the tank to be pumped out. He thereupon saw a frog sitting at the mouth of a hole. On seeing this, the king passed the following order in anger.</p>
<p id='21'>सर्वत्र मण्डूकवधः क्रियतामिति यो मयार्थी स मां मृतमण्डूकोपायनमदायोपतिष्ठेदिति॥<br />“Kill all frogs wherever they are to be found. Whoever wishes to see me, let him come to me with a dead frog as tribute."</p>
<p id='22'>अथ मण्डूकवधे तीरे क्रियमाणे दिक्षु सर्वासु मण्डूकान् भयमाविवेश। ते भीता मण्डूकराज्ञे यथावृत्तं न्यवेदयन्॥<br />When this fearful destruction of frogs went on, the frightened frogs went to their king and told him all that had happened.</p>
<p id='23'>ततो मण्डूकाराट् तापसवेषधारी राजानमभ्यगच्छदुपेत्य चैनमुवाच॥<br />Thereupon the king of the frogs, assuming the garb of an ascetic Brahmana, came to that monarch and thus spoke to him,</p>
<p id='24'>मा राजन् क्रोधवशं गमः प्रसादं कुरु नार्हसि मण्डूकानामनपराधिनां वधं कर्तुमिति। श्लोकौ चात्र भवतः॥<br />“O king, do not allow anger to take possession of you. Be king, you should not destroy the innocent frogs."</p>
<p id='25'>मा मण्डूकान् जिघांस त्वं कोपं संधारयाच्युत। प्रक्षीयतेधनोद्रेको जनानामविजानताम्॥ प्रतिजानीहि नैतांस्त्वं प्राप्य क्रोधं विमोक्ष्यसि। अलं कृत्वा तवाधर्मं मण्डूकैः किं हतैर्हि ते॥<br />Two slokas here follow O undeteriorating one, do not destroy the frogs. Pacify your wrath. The prosperity and ascetic merit of those that have their souls steeped in ignorance always suffer diminution. Pledge yourself not to be angry with the frogs. What need have you to commit such a sin? what purpose will be served by killing the frogs?”</p>
<p id='26'>तमेवंवादिनमिष्टजनशोकपरीतात्मा राजाथोवाच॥<br />To him the king whose heart was full of the grief for the disappearance of his dear one thus spoke,</p>
<p id='27'>न हि क्षम्यते तन्मया हनिष्याम्येतानेतैर्दुरात्मभिः प्रिया मे भक्षिता सर्वथैव मे वध्या मण्डूका नार्हसि विद्वन् मामुपरो मिति॥<br />"I will never forgive the frogs. I will certainly destroy them. My beloved wife has been devoured by one of these wicked wretches. The frogs therefore will always deserve to be killed by me. O lcarned man, you shall not intercede on their behalf."</p>
<p id='28'>स तद् वाक्यमुपलभ्य व्यथितेन्द्रियमनाः प्रोवाच प्रसीद राजन्नहमायुर्नाम मण्डूकराजो मम सा दुहिता सुशोभना नाम। तस्या हि दौःशील्यमेतद् बवहस्त्या राजानो विप्रलब्धाः पूर्वा इति॥ तमब्रवीद् राजा तया समर्थी सा मे दीयतामिति।<br />Having heard his words, he (the frog king) thus spoke with his senses and mind much pained, "O king, be kind. I am the king of the frogs, named Ayu. She was my daughter, named Sushobhana. This is but an instance of her bad character. She had deceived many other kings before. Then the king said, “I desire to have her. Let her be given to me by you."</p>
<p id='29'>अथैनां राज्ञे पितादादब्रवीच्चैनामेनं राजानं शुश्रूषस्वेति॥<br />Thereupon her father bestowed her upon him and he spoke to her thus, “Wait upon this king."</p>
<p id='30'>स एवमुक्त्वा दुहितरं क्रुद्धः शशाप यस्मात् त्वया राजानो विप्रलब्धा बहवस्तस्माद ब्रह्मण्यानि तवापत्यानि भविष्यन्त्यानृतिकत्वात् तवेति॥<br />Having said this, he thus cursed his daughter in anger, “As you have deceived many kings, for your this untruthful conduct, your sons will be haters of Brahmanas."</p>
<p id='31'>स च राजा तामुपलभ्य तस्यां सुरतगुणानिवद्धहृदयो लोकत्रयैश्वर्यमिवोपलभ्य हर्षेण वाष्पकलया वाचा प्रणिपत्याभिपूज्य मण्डूकराजमब्रवादनुगृहीतोऽस्मीति।।<br />Having obtained her, the king became greatly enamoured of her for her great accomplishments. Feeling that he had, as it were, obtained the sovereignty of the three worlds, he bowed down his head to the king of the frogs. Honouring him in due form he thus spoke with his voice choked with tears of joy, "I have been much favoured."</p>
<p id='32'>स च मण्डूकराजो दुहितरमनुज्ञाप्य यथागतमगच्छत्॥<br />The king of the frogs, then biding farewell to his daughter, went away whence he had come.</p>
<p id='33'>अथ कस्यचित् कालस्य तस्यां कुमारास्त्रयस्तस्य राज्ञः सम्बभूवुः शलो दलो बलश्चेति। ततस्तेषां ज्येष्ठं शलं समये पिता राज्येऽभिषिच्य तपसि धृतात्मा वनं जगाम्॥<br />After sometime, the king begot on her three sons. They were named, Shala, Dala and Bala. Sometime after, the king, their father, installing the eldest son on the throne, went to a forest with the desire of practising asceticism.</p>
<p id='34'>अथ कदाचिच्छलो मृगयामनुचरन् मृगमासाद्य रथेनान्वधावत्॥<br />One day Shala, when out in hunting, saw a deer and pursued it on his car.</p>
<p id='35'>सूतं चोवाच शीघ्रं मां वहस्वेति स तथोक्तः सूतो राजानमब्रवीत्॥<br />He spoke to the charioteer “Drive me faster.” Having been thus addressed the charioteer said to the king,</p>
<p id='36'>न क्रियतामनुबन्धो नैष शक्यस्त्वया मृगोऽयं ग्रहीतुं यद्यपि ते रथे युक्तौ वाम्यौ स्यातामिति।।ततोऽब्रवीद् राजा सूतमाचक्ष्व मे वाम्यौ हन्मि च त्वामिति। स एवमुक्तो राजभयभीत: सूतो वामदेवशापभीतश्च सन् नाचख्यौ राज्ञे। ततः पुनः स राजा खङ्गमुद्यम्य शीघ्रं कथयस्वेति तमाह हनिय॑ त्वामिति। स तदाऽऽह राजभयभीतः सूतो वामदेवस्याश्चौ वाम्यौ मनोजवाविति॥<br />"Do not entertain such a purpose. This deer is incapable of being caught by you. If however Vami horses were yoked to your chariot, then you could have caught it.” Thereupon the king said to the charioteer. Tell me all about the Vami horses or else I shall kill you,” Having been thus addressed by the king, the charioteer became greatly frightened. He was afraid of the king, he was also afraid of the Vamadeva; and therefore he did not tell the king anything. Thereupon the king uplifting his sword again said to him. “Tell me soon or I will certainly kill you.” Being afraid of the king, the charioteer said, “Vami horses are those that belong to Vamadeva, they are as fleet as the mind.</p>
<p id='37'>अथैनमेवं ब्रुवाणमब्रवीद् राजा वामदेवाश्रमं प्रयाहीति स गत्वा वामदेवाश्रमं तमृषिमब्रवीत्॥<br />When he said this, the king thus spoke to him, "go (at once) to the hermitage of Vamadeva." Having gone to the hermitage of Vamadeva, he thus spoke to that Rishi,</p>
<p id='38'>भगवन् मृगो मे विद्धः पलायते सम्भावयितुमर्हसि वाम्यौ दातुमिति। तमब्रवीदृषिर्ददानि ते वाम्यौ कृतकार्येण भवता ममैव वाम्यौ निर्यात्यौ क्षिप्रमिति। स च तावश्वौ प्रतिगृह्यानुज्ञाप्य ऋषिं प्रायाद् वामीप्रयुक्तेन रथेन मृगं प्रतिगच्छंश्चाब्रवीत् सूतमश्वरत्नाविमावयोग्यौ ब्राह्मणानां नैतौ प्रतिदेयौ वामदेवायेत्युक्त्वा मृगमवाप्य स्वनगरमेत्याश्वावन्तः पुरेऽस्थापयत्॥<br />"O exalted one, a deer shot by me is flying away. You should make me capable of catching it by giving me your pair of Vami horses. The Rishi replied, "I give you my pair of Vami horses; but after accomplishing your object, you must soon return them to me." Having taken those horses and having obtained the Rishi's permission, the king yoked the paid of Vami horses to his car and then pursued the deer. When he had left the hermitage, he thus spoke to his charioteer. “There (two) jewels of horses the Brahmanas (by no means) deserve to possess. They must not be returned to Vamadeva.” Having said this and caught the deer, he returned to his capital and kept the Vami horses in the inner apartments of his palace.</p>
<p id='39'>अथर्षिश्चिन्तयामास तरुणो राजपुत्रः कल्याणं पत्रमासाद्य रमते न प्रतिनिर्यातयत्यहो कष्टमिति॥<br />Thereupon the Rishi reflected, “This prince is young. Having obtained an excellent pair of horses, he is sporting with them in great joy without returning them to me. Alas! What a pity!"</p>
<p id='40'>स मनसा विचिन्त्य मासि पूर्णे शिष्यमब्रवीत्॥ गच्छात्रेय राजानं ब्रूहि यदि पर्याप्तं निर्यातयोपाध्यायवाम्याविति। स गत्वैवं तं राजानमब्रवीत् तं राजा प्रत्युवाच राज्ञामेतद्वाहनमनर्हा ब्राह्मणा रत्नानामेवंविधानां किं ब्राह्मणानामश्वैः कार्यं साधु गम्यताम्॥<br />Having thus thought in his mind, he spoke to one of his disciples after full one month had passed away. “O Atreya, go and ask the king what he had done with the Vami horses. He should return them to your preceptor. He went to the king and spoke to him as instructed. Thereupon the king replied, “These two horses deserve (only) to be possessed by kings. The Brahmanas do not deserve to possess jewels of such value. What business have Brahmanas with horses? Go back with contentment."</p>
<p id='41'>स गत्वैतदुपाध्यायाचष्ट तच्छ्रुत्वा वचनमप्रियं वामदेवः क्रोधपरीतात्मा स्वयमेव राजानमभिगम्याश्वार्थमचोदयन्न चाददद् राजा॥<br />Going back he told all to the preceptor. Having heard this sad news, Vamadeva was filled with wrath and he himself went to the king and asked for his horses. But he declined to give him what he asked.</p>
<p id='42'>वामदेव उवाच प्रयच्छ वाम्यौ मम पार्थिव त्वं कृतं हि ते कार्यमाभ्यामशक्यम्। मा त्वा वधीद् वरुणो घोरपाशौब्रह्मक्षत्रस्यान्तरे वर्तमानम्॥<br />Vamadeva said: O king, give me my Vami horses. By them you have accomplished something which was impossible to be accomplished by you. By transgressing the practices of both the Brahmanas and the Kshatriyas, do not cause your own death by the terrible curse of Varuna.</p>
<p id='43'>राजोवाच अनड्वाहौ सुव्रतौ साधु दान्तावेतद् विप्राणां वाहनं वामदेव। ताभ्यां याहि त्वं तत्र कामो महर्षे छन्दांसि वै त्वादृशं संवहन्ति॥<br />The king said : O Vamadeva, these two excellent, well trained and docile bulls are fit animals for Brahmanas. Go with them wherever you like. Even the Vedas carry person, like you, (what will you do with horses)?</p>
<p id='44'>वामदेव उवाच छन्दांसि वै मादृशं संवहन्ति लोकेऽमुष्मिन् पार्थिव यानि सन्ति। अस्मिन्स्तु लोके मम यानमेतदस्मद्विधानामपरेषां च राजन्॥<br />Vamadeva said : O king, the Vedas indeed carry persons like us, but that is in the next world. But in this world animals like these (horses) carry me and also men like me and also all others,</p>
<p id='45'>राजोवाच चत्वारस्त्वां वा गर्दभाः संवहन्तु श्रेष्ठाश्वतर्यो हरयो वातरंहाः। तैस्त्वं याहि क्षत्रियस्यैष वाहो ममैव वाम्यौ न तवैतौ हि विद्धि॥<br />The king said: Let four asses carry you or four mules of the best kind or four horses as fleet as the wind. Go away with these, the pair of Vami horses deserve to be possessed only by the Kshatriyas. Therefore, know that those (Vami horses) are not yours.</p>
<p id='46'>वामदेव उवाच घोरं व्रतं ब्राह्मणस्यैतदाहुरेतद् राजन् यदिहाजीवमानः। अयस्मया घोररूपा महान्तश्चत्वारो वा यातुधानाः सुरौद्राः। मया प्रयुक्तास्त्वद्वधमीप्समाना वहन्तु त्वां शितशूलाश्चतु॥<br />Vamadeva said: O king, very severe vows have been ordained for the Brahmanas. If I have observed them, then let. four fearful and mightyRakshasas of terrible appearance and iron body pursue you at my command and kill you and then carry you on their sharp lances after cutting up your body into four parts.</p>
<p id='47'>राजोवाच ये त्वां विदुर्ब्राह्मणं वामदेव वाचा हन्तुं मनसा कर्मणा वा। ते त्वां सशिष्यमिह पातयन्तु मद्वाक्यनुन्नाः शितशूलासिहस्ता:॥<br />The king said: O Vamadeva, let those that are armed with bright lances and swords and that know you to be a Brahmana who desires to take life in thought, word and deed, at my command cut you down with all your disciples,</p>
<p id='48'>वामदेव उवाच ममैतौ वाम्यौ प्रतिगृह्य राजन् पुनर्ददानीति प्रपद्य त्वम्। प्रयच्छ शीघ्रं मम वाम्यौ त्वमश्वौ यद्यात्मानं जीवितुं ते क्षमं स्यात्॥<br />Vamadeva said: O king, when you receive from me these Vami horses, you had said, I will return them." Therefore give me back my Vami horses, so that you can save your life.</p>
<p id='49'>राजोवाच न ब्राह्मणेभ्यो मृगया प्रसूता न त्वानुशास्म्यद्यप्रभृति हसत्यम्। तवैवाज्ञां सम्प्रणिधाय सर्वां तथा ब्रह्मन् पुण्यलोकं लभेयम्॥<br />The king said: Hunting is ordained for the Kshatriyas. I do not punish you for your untruthfulness. O Brahmana, obeying all your commands, I shall obtain the blessed region.</p>
<p id='50'>वामदेव उवाच नानुयोगा ब्राह्मणानां भवन्ति मे वाचा राजन् मनसा कर्मणा वा। स्तेन श्रेष्ठो भवति हि जीवमानः॥<br />Vamadeva said : A Brahmana can never be punished in thoughts, words or deeds. That learned man who succeeds by ascetic austerities on knowing a Brahmana to be so does not attain to prominence in this world.</p>
<p id='51'>मार्कण्डेय उवाच एवमुक्ते वामदेवेन राजन् समुत्तस्थू राक्षसा घोररूपाः। तैः शूलहस्तैर्वध्यमानः स राजा प्रोवाचेदं वाक्यमुच्चैस्तदानीम्॥<br />Markandeya said : O king, when the king had been thus addressed by Vamadeva, there rose four fearful-featured Rakshasas. As they with up lifted lances in their hands came to the king with the intention of killing him, he thus cried aloud,</p>
<p id='52'>विधेया मे यदि चेमे विशोऽपि। नोत्स्रक्ष्येऽहं वामदेवस्य वाम्यौ नैवंविधाधर्मशीला भवन्ति॥<br />"O Brahmana, if all the Ikshvakus, if Dala (my brother), if all these Vaishyas tell me, even then I will not give up these Vami horses to Vamadeva, for these men can never (then) be virtuous."</p>
<p id='53'>हतो जगामाशु महीं क्षितीशः। मिक्ष्वाकवो वै दलमभ्यषिञ्चन्॥<br />When he was thus speaking, they (the Rakshasas) killed him and that lord of earth fell on the ground. Thereupon learning in the death of the king, the Ikshvakus installed Dala on the throne."</p>
<p id='54'>राज्ये तदा तत्र गत्वा स विप्रः प्रोवाचेदं वचनं वामदेवः। मेवं राजन् सर्वधर्मेषु दृष्टम्॥<br />Then the Brahmana Vamadeva went to his kingdom and spoke thus to the king Dala, “O king, it has been ordained in all the Shastras that men should give away to the Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='55'>विभेषि चेत् त्वमधर्मान्नरेन्द्र प्रयच्छ मे शीघ्रमेवाद्य वाम्यौ। एतच्छ्रुत्वा वामदेवस्य वाक्यं स पार्थिवः सूतमुवाच रोषात॥<br />O king, if you fear sin, then give me my Vami horses back without any delay." Having heard these words of Vamadeva, that king spoke thus to the charioteer in anger,"</p>
<p id='56'>एकं हि मे सायकं चित्ररूपं दिग्धं विषेणाहर संगृहीतम्। येन विद्धो वामदेवः शयीत संदश्यमानः श्वभिरार्तरूपः॥<br />Bring me one of those beautiful but poisonous arrows that are kept with you, so that pierced by it, Vamadeva may lie prostrate on the ground in pain and be torn by the dogs.</p>

Hearing that he had been killed by his arrows, Dala spoke these words.</p>

Let Vamadeva be blessed with a long life.</p>
<p id='62'>वामदेव उवाच संस्पृश्यैनां महिषी सायकेन ततस्तस्मादेनसो मोक्ष्यसे त्वम्। ततस्तथा कृतवान् पार्थिवस्तु ततो मुनि राजपुत्री बभाषे॥<br />Vamadeva said: Touching your queen with this arrow, you may cleanse yourself off this sin. After that the king did as he was directed and then the princess spoke thus to the Rishi.</p>
<p id='63'>राजपुत्र्युवाच यथा युक्ता वामदेवाहमेनं दिने दिने संदिशन्ती नृशंसम्। ब्राह्मणेभ्यो मृगयती सूनृतानि तथा ब्रह्मन् पुण्यलोकं लभेयम्॥<br />The Queen said : O Vamadeva, let me be able to instruct duly this foolish, husband of mine from day to day imparting to him words of grave import. Let me always wait upon and serve the Brahmanas; and by this, O twice born one, let me acquire the sacred regions after death.</p>

Thereupon that king, becoming exceedingly happy and bowing to the great Rishi, gave him his Vami horses.</p>
