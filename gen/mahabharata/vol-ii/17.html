On it (the car) stood a standard, bearing, the figure of a gaping-inouthed Makara.It was as fearful as Yama himself. He rushed upon the his steeds who were rather flying than running over the ground. The hero, equipped with quiver and sword and with his fingers incased in leather, stringed with great strength the bow which possessed the splendour of bow which possessed the splendour of lightning. Transferring it from hand to hand as if in contempt of the enemy, he spread confusion émong the Danavas and the other warriors, the inhabitants of Saubha.</p>
<p id='2'>तस्य विक्षिपतश्चापं संदधानस्य चासकृत्। नान्तरं ददृशे कश्चिन्निघ्नत: शात्रवान् रणे॥<br />As he went on killing the Danavas in battle and as he sat in contempt of the foe (on his car), none could mark the slightest interval between the successive arrows (shot by him.)</p>
