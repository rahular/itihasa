<h3>ARANEYA PARVA)-Continued The questions put by Yaksha (to Yudhishthira: Chapter 313</h3><h4></h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच स ददर्श हतान् भ्रातृन् लोकपालानिव च्युतान्। युगान्ते समनुप्राप्ते शक्रप्रतिमगौरवान्॥<br />Vaishampayana said : He (Yudhishthira) then beheld his brothers, glorious as Shakra himself, lying dead like the Lokapalas dropped down form their regions at the end of a Yuga.</p>
<p id='2'>विनिकीर्णधनुर्बाणं दृष्ट्वा निहतमर्जुनम्। भीमसेनं यमौ चैव निर्विचेष्टान् गतायुषः॥ स दीर्घमुष्णं नि:श्वस्य शोकवाष्पपरिप्लुतः। तान् दृष्ट्वा पतितान् भ्रातृन् सर्वांश्चिन्तासमन्वितः॥ धर्मपुत्रो महाबाहुर्विललाप सुविस्तरम्।<br />Seeing Arjuna dead with his bow and arrow lying scattered and also Bhimasena and the twins lying motionless with life extinct, Yudhishthira breathing out a long and hot sigh was bathed in tears caused by grief. Afflicted with anxiety at beholding all his brothers lying dead. The mighty-armed son of Dharma gave bent to a great profusion of grief</p>
<p id='3'>ननु त्वया महाबाहो प्रतिज्ञातं वृकोदरा॥ सुयोधनस्य भेत्स्यामि गदया सक्थिनी रणे। व्यर्थं तदद्य मे सर्वं त्वयि वीर निपातिते॥ महात्मनि महाबाहो कुरूणां कीर्तिवर्धने।<br />He said, "O mighty-armed Vrikodara, you swore, I will break the thighs of Duryodhana with mace in battle.' O Bhima, since you are dead all that has become to no purpose to me.</p>
<p id='4'>मनुष्यसम्भवा वाचो विधर्मिण्य: प्रतिश्रुताः॥ भवतां दिव्यवाचस्तु ता भवन्तु कथं मृषा।<br />O high-minded and mighty-armed enhancer of the glory of the Kurus, human promises may not be fulfilled, but how is it that celestials words with regard to you have proved untrue?</p>
<p id='5'>देवाश्चापि यदावाचन सूतके त्वां धनंजय॥ सहस्राक्षादनवरः कुन्ति पुत्रस्तवेति वै। उत्तरे पारियात्रे च जगुर्भूतानि सर्वशः॥ विप्रणष्टां श्रियं चैषामाहर्ता पुनरञ्जसा। नास्य जेता रणे कश्चिदजेता नैष कस्यचित्॥<br />O Dhananjaya, when you were born, the very gods themselves said, “O Kunti, this son of yours shall in no way be inferior to the thousand-eyed deity.” And in the northern r'aripatra mountain all the beings sang, “The prosperity these have been deprived of, by enemies, shall surely be recovered by this one. There shall be no vanquisher of him in battle and there shall be none whom he will not be able to conquer."</p>
<p id='6'>सोऽयं मृत्युवंश यातः कथं जिष्णुमहाबलः। अयं ममाशां संहत्य शेते भूमौ धनंजयः॥ आश्रित्य यं वयं नाथं दुःखान्येतानि सेहिम।<br />How is it, then, that this highly powerful Jishnu has been subject to death? Why does that Dhananjaya lie dead on the ground destroying all my hopes, depending on whom we have gone through all these miseries?</p>
<p id='7'>रणे प्रमत्तौ वीरौ च सदा शत्रुनिबर्हणौ॥ कथं रिपुवशं यातौ कुन्तीपुत्रौ महाबलौ। यौ सर्वास्त्राप्रतिहतौ भीमसेनधनंजयौ॥<br />Why have these two highly powerful and heroic sons of Kunti, Bhimasena and Dhananjaya, furious in battle, who always destroyed their enemies and whom no weapons could resist, been subjugated by the enemy?</p>
<p id='8'>अश्मसारमयं नूनं हृदयं ममम दुहृदः। यमौ यदेतौ दृष्ट्वाद्य पतितौ नावदीर्यते॥<br />Surely this vile heart of me is made of the essence of marble, since seeing these twins lying dead today it is not riven.</p>
<p id='9'>शास्त्रज्ञा देशकालज्ञास्तपोयुक्ताः क्रियान्विताः। अकृत्वा सदृशं कर्म किं शेध्वं पुरुषर्षभाः॥<br />Why do you, O most exalted of men, versed in the Shastras, acquainted with the rules of proper time and place, performers of religious rites, lie dead without performing acts 'worthy of you?</p>
<p id='10'>अविक्षतशरीराश्चाप्यप्रमृष्टशरासनाः। असंज्ञा भुवि संगम्य किं शेध्वमपराजिताः॥<br />O unvanquished ones, with your bodies unwounded and bows untouched, why do you lie insensible embracing the earth”?</p>
<p id='11'>सानूनिवारेः संसुप्तान् दृष्ट्वा भ्रातृन् महामतिः। सुखं प्रसुप्तान् प्रस्विनः खिन्नः कष्टां दशां गतः॥<br />And that large hearted one, beholding his brothers sweetly asleep as (they slept peacefully) on the plateaus of mountains perspired profusely, became sorely afflicted and was reduced to a piteous plight,</p>
<p id='12'>एवमेवेदमित्युक्त्वा धर्मात्मा स नरेश्वरः। शोकसागरमध्यस्थो दध्यौ कारणमाकुलः॥<br />That virtuous souled lord of men, saying "it is so," and drowned in the sea of sorrow and with an agitated heart, began to think of the cause of his brothers' death.</p>
<p id='13'>इतिकर्तव्यतां चेति देशकालविभागवित्। नाभिपेदे महाबाहुश्चिन्तयानो महामतिः॥<br />And though that high-minded one of mighty arms, acquainted with the divisions of time and place, pondered much, he could not settle what he should do.</p>
<p id='14'>अथ संस्तभ्य धर्मात्मा तदाऽऽत्मानं तपोयुतः। एवं विलप्य बहुधा धर्मपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरः॥<br />Thus lamenting profusely, the virtuous minded son of Tapa or Dharma, Yudhishthira, pacified his soul.</p>
<p id='15'>बुद्ध्या विचिन्तयामास वीराः केन निपातिताः॥<br />And began, by the exercise of his intelligence, to ponder thus “by whom these warriors have been slain?</p>
<p id='16'>नैषां शस्त्रप्रहारोऽस्ति पदं नेहास्ति कस्यचित्। भूतं महदिदं मन्ये भ्रातरो येन मे हताः॥<br />There are no strokes of weapons on their bodies nor are there any foot prints of any body. I consider he is a mighty being who has slain my brothers.</p>
<p id='17'>एकाचं चिन्तयिष्यामि पीत्वा वेत्स्यामि वा जलम्। स्यात् तु दुर्योधनेनेदमुपांशुविहितं कृतम्॥ गान्धारराजरचितं सततं जिह्मबुद्धिना। यस्य कार्यमकार्यं वा सममेव भवत्युत॥ कस्तस्य विश्वसेद् वीरो दुष्कृतेकृतात्मनः। अथवा पुरुषैर्गुढैः प्रयोगोऽयं दुरात्मनः॥<br />I will reflect on this with concentration or I will try to know of it after drinking water. Perhaps the crooked-minded Duryodhana with whom good and evil are alike has got it (the tark) destruc.ive of life, made by the king of Gandhara. What cool-headed person can trust that wicked minded man ever bent on evil deeds? Or perhaps that wicked souled one has caused it to be made by some secret messengers of his."</p>
<p id='18'>भवेदिति महाबुद्धिर्बहुधा तदचिन्तयत्। तस्यासीन्न विषेणेदमुदकं दूषितं यथा॥<br />Thus that highly intellectual one gave way to many thoughts. But he could, in no way, persuade himself that the water was prisoned,</p>
<p id='19'>मृतानामपि चैतेषां विकृतं नैव जायते। मुखवर्णाः प्रसन्ना मे भ्रातृणामित्यचिन्तयत्॥<br />For, though dead, their features had undergone no change. And he thought "the colour on the face of my brothers is still lively.</p>
<p id='20'>एकैकशश्चौघबलानिमान् पुरुषसत्तमान्। कोऽन्यः प्रतिसमासेत कालान्तकयमादृते॥<br />Each of these foremost of men is possessed of the force of a water fall. Who else, therefore, can vanquish them except that being who carries away every thing in proper time."</p>
<p id='21'>एतेन व्यवसायेन तत् तोयं व्यवगाढवान्। गाहमानश्च तत् तोयमन्तरिक्षात् स शुश्रुवे॥<br />Thinking it to be certain, he plunged into that water. And as he got into it he heard these words from the firmament.</p>
<p id='22'>यक्ष उवाच अहं बकः शैवलमत्स्यभक्षो नीता मया प्रेतवशं तवानुजाः। त्वं पञ्चमो भविता राजपुत्र न चेत् प्रश्नान् पृच्छतो व्याकरोषि॥<br />The Yaksha said: I am a crane living on moss and fish. Your younger brothers have been, by me, brought under the control of death. If, O king's son, you do not answer the questions put by me, you shall be the fifth victim.</p>

<p id='27'>विषहेरन् महायुद्धे कृतं ते तन्महाद्भुतम्। न ते जानामि यत् कार्यं नाभिजानामि काक्षितम्॥<br />Could stand them in mighty conflict. (Therefore) what you have done is highly marvellous. Neither am I aware of what is your business nor do I know of your intentions.</p>
<p id='28'>कौतूहलं महज्जातं साध्वसं चागतं मम। येनास्म्युद्विग्नहदयः समुत्पन्नशिरोज्वरः॥ पृच्छामि भगवंस्तस्मात् को भवानिह तिष्ठति।<br />I am very curious (to learn all this) and am terrified also. For which my heart is troubled and my head is racked. Therefore, O adorable one, I ask you who you are that are staying here.</p>

And that best of the Bharatas saw that huge-bodied Yaksha endued with unnatural eyes, tall as a palm tree, blazing like the sun or the fire, irresistible, huge as a rock, staying on a tree and uttering deep loud roars like the rumbling of the clouds.</p>
<p id='31'>यक्ष उवाच इमे ते भ्रातरो राजन् वार्यमाणा मयासकृत्॥ बलात् तोयं जिहीर्षन्तस्ततो वै मृदिता मया। न पेयमुदकं राजन् प्राणानिह परीप्सता॥ पार्थ मा साहसं कार्मिम पूर्वपरिग्रहः। प्रश्नानुक्त्वा तु कौन्तेय ततः पिब हरस्व च।॥<br />The Yaksha said: These brothers of you, O king, though again and again forbidden by me. Wanted to take away water by force. I have therefore killed them. He that has a love for his life ought not, O king, to drink this water. O Partha, do not attempt it. This (pond) has been taken possession of by me before. O son of Kunti, answering my questions, you may drink and take away water.</p>
