<h3>None: Chapter 200</h3><h4>The merits of charity</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच श्रुत्वा स राजा राजर्षेरिन्द्रद्युम्नस्य तत् तदा। मार्कण्डेयान्महाभागात् स्वर्गस्य प्रतिपादनम्॥ युधिष्ठिरो महाराज पुनः पप्रच्छ तं मुनिम्।<br />Vaishampayana said : Having heard from the highly exalted Markandeya the story of the royal sage Indradyumna's regaining heaven, the king Yudhishthira, the great monarch, again asked the Rishi,</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>कीदृशीषु ह्यवस्थासु दत्त्वा दानं महामुने॥ इन्द्रलोकं त्वनुभवेत् पुरुषस्तद् द्रवीहि मे।<br />“O great Rishi, tell me how a man should practice charity to go to the regions of Indra.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>गार्हस्थ्येऽप्यथवा बाल्ये यौवने स्थविरेऽपि वा। यथा फलं समश्याति तथा त्वं कथयस्व मे॥<br />Is it by practicing charity when leading the domestic life or in boyhood or in youth or in the old age (that one goes to Indra's abode)? Tell me the respective merits of charity in different stages of life.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>मार्कण्डेय उवाच वृथा जन्मानि चत्वारि वृथा दानानि षोडश। वृथा जन्म ह्यपुत्रस्य ये च धर्मबहिष्कृताः॥ परपाकेषु येऽश्नन्ति आत्मार्थं च पचेत् तु यः। पर्यश्नन्ति वृथा ये च तदसत्यं प्रकीर्त्यते।५॥<br />Markandeya said : The life, that is useless, is of four kinds and the charity which is useless is of sixteen kinds. That life is useless in which there is no son born, in which one has no virtue. In which one lives on food given by another and in which one cook (food) for himself only, without giving to the Pitris, the celestials and the guests and one who eats before all these.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>आरूढपतिते दत्तमन्यायोपहृतं च यत्। व्यर्थंतु पतिते दानं ब्राह्मणे तस्करे तथा॥<br />The gift to one who has fallen away from the path of virtue and the gift of wealth which has been earned wrongly and dishonestly are both useless. The gifts to a fallen Brahmana, to a thief to a false preceptor, are also useless.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>गुरौ चानृतिके पापे कृतघ्ने ग्रामयाजके। वेदविक्रयिणे दत्तं तथा वृषलयाजके॥ ब्रह्मबन्धुषु यद् दत्तं यद् दत्तं वृषलीपतौ। स्त्रीजनेषु च यद् दत्तं व्यालग्राहे तथैव च॥ परिचारकेषु यद् दत्तं वृथा दानानि षोडश।<br />The gift to an untruthful man, to one who officiates at sacrifices performed by all classes of people residing in a village, to one that sells the Vedas to a Brahmana who cooks for a Shudra, to one who is by birth a Brahmana, but who does not perform the duties of his order, is all in vain. The gift to one who has married a girl already in her puberty, to a woman, to one who sports with a snake and to one who is engaged in minimal services, is also in vain. These are the sixteen useless charities.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>तमोवृतस्तु यो दद्याद् भयात् क्रोधात् तथैव च।॥ भुङ्क्ते च दानं तत् सर्वं गर्भस्थस्तु नरः सदा। ददद् दानं द्विजातिभ्यो वृद्धभावेन मानवः॥<br />He who gives away wealth out of fear or anger. Enjoys the fruits of that charity when he remains in the womb of his mother. The man who gives away (wealth) to the Brahmanas, enjoys its fruits while he is in old age.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>तस्मात् सर्वास्ववस्थासु सर्वदानानि पार्थिव दातव्यानि द्विजातिभ्यः स्वर्गमार्गजिगीषया॥<br />O king, therefore, the man who desires to get to the path of heaven should under all conditions give away (wealth) to the Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच चातुर्वर्ण्यस्य सर्वस्य वर्तमानाः प्रतिग्रहे। केन विप्रा विशेषेण तारयन्ति तरन्ति च॥<br />Yudhishthira said : By what means do the Brahmanas, who receive gifts from all the four orders, save others as well as themselves?</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>मार्कण्डेय उवाच जपैर्मन्त्रैश्च होमैश्च स्वाध्यायाध्ययनेन च। नावं वेदमयीं कृत्वा तारयन्ति तरन्ति च॥<br />Markandeya said: By Japa, by Mantras by Homa and by the study of the Vedas, they (Brahmanas) build a Veda boat and with it they save others as well as themselves.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>ब्राह्मणांस्तोषयेद् यस्तु तुष्यन्ते तस्य देवताः। वचनाच्चापि विप्राणां स्वर्गलोकमवाप्नुयात्॥<br />The celestials themselves are gratified with that man who gratifies the Brahmanas. At the command of a Brahmana a man obtains heaven.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>पितृदैवतपूजाभिर्ब्राह्मणाभ्यर्चनेन च। अनन्तं पुण्यलोकं तु गन्तासि त्वं न संशयः॥<br />O king, you will certainly go to heaven for your worshipping the Pitris and the celestials and for your showing great reverence to the Brahmanas,</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>श्लेष्मादिभिर्व्याप्ततनुम्रियमाणो विचेतनः। ब्राह्मणा एव सम्पूज्याः पुण्यं स्वर्गमभीप्सता।१६।।<br />Even if your body be dull and weak and full of phlegm. He who desires to obtain virtue and heaven should worship the Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>श्राद्धकाले तु यत्नेन भोक्तव्या ह्यजुगुप्सिताः। दुर्वर्णः कुनखी कुष्ठी मायावी कुण्डगोलकौ॥ वर्जनीयाः प्रयलेन काण्डपृष्ठाश्च देहिनः। जुगुप्सितं हि यच्छ्राद्धं दहत्यग्निरिवेन्धनम्॥<br />One should with great care feed them at the time of Shraddha ceremonies, but those among them (Brahmana) that are cursed or fallen, that are either exceeding handsome or excessively black, that have diseased nails, that are lepers, that are deceitful, that are bastards, born of widows or of women with their husbands in exile and that support themselves by the profession of arms, all these should be excluded. A censurable Shraddha consumes the performer as fire consumes the wood.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>ये ये श्राद्धे न युज्यन्ते मूकान्धबधिरादयः। तेऽपि सर्वे नियोक्तव्या मिश्रिता वेदपारगैः॥<br />If those that are to be employed in a Shraddha happen to be dumb, blind or deaf, care should be taken to employ them with the Brahmanas who are learned in the Vedas.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>प्रतिग्रहश्च वै देयः शृणु यस्य युधिष्ठिर। प्रदातारं तथाऽऽत्मानं यस्तारयति शक्तिमान्॥ तस्मिन् देयं द्विजे दानं सर्वागमविजानता। प्रदातारं यथाऽऽत्मानं तारयेद् यः स शक्तिमान्॥<br />O Yudhishthira, hear now what you should give away. He who knows the Vedas should give away to only those Brahmanas who are able to save both the giver and himself, for he only is to be considered a competent (Brahmana) who can save the giver and himself.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>न तथा हविषो होमैन पुष्पैर्नानुलेपनैः। अग्नयः पार्थ तुष्यन्ति यथा ह्यतिथिभोजने॥<br />O son of Pritha, the sacred fire does not become so much gratified in receiving the libations of Ghee, the offering of flowers and sandal paste and other perfumes as by the entertainment of guests.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>तस्मात् त्वं सर्वयत्नेन यतस्वातिथिभोजने। पादोदकं पादघृतं दीपमन्नं प्रतिश्रयम्॥ प्रयच्छन्ति तु ये राजन् नोपसर्पन्ति ते यमम्।<br />Therefore with all care entertain guests. O king, those that give to his guests water to wash his feet, butter to rub over his tired legs, light in darkness and food and shelter, do not (at all) go before Yama.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>देवमाल्यापनयनं द्विजोच्छिष्टावमार्जनम्॥ आकल्प: परिचर्या च गात्रसंवाहनानि च। अत्रैकैकं नृपश्रेष्ठ गोदानाद्ध्यतिरिच्यते॥<br />The removal of garlands of flowers offered to the gods, the removal of the remnant of a Brahmana's food, serving with prepared pastes, the shampooing of a Brahmana's legs, O foremost of kings, each of these gives better fruits than the giving away of kine.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>कपिलायाः प्रदानात् तु मुच्यते नात्र संशयः। तस्मादलंकृतां दद्यात् कपिलां तु द्विजातये॥<br />A man certainly rescues himself (from hell) by giving away Kapila cow, therefore a Kapila cow, decked with ornaments, should be given to a Brahmana.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>श्रोत्रियाय दरिद्राय गृहस्थायाग्निहोत्रिणे। पुत्रदाराभिभूताय तथा ह्यनुपकारिणे॥<br />One should make gifts to a person nobly born, one who is learned in the Vedas, one that is fair, one who leads a domestic life, but who is burdened with wife and children, one who duly worships the sacred fire and one who has done you no service.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>एवंविधेषु दातव्या न समृद्धेषु भारत। को गुणो भरतश्रेष्ठ समृद्धेष्वभिवर्जितम्॥<br />O best of the Bharata race, O descendant of Bharata, you should always give away to such men and not to those who are wealthy. What merit is there to give (wealth) to one who is wealthy?</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>एकस्यैका प्रदातव्या न बहूनां कदाचन। सा गौर्विक्रयमापन्ना हन्यात् त्रिपुरुषं कुलम्॥ न तारयति दातारं ब्राह्मणं नैव नैव तु।<br />One cow must be given to one Brahmana. One single cow must not be given to many Brahmanas. If that cow is sold, three generations of the giver's family would be lost. Such a gift will neither rescue the giver nor the Brahmana who takes it.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>सुवर्णस्य विशुद्धस्य सुवर्णं यः प्रयच्छति॥ सुवर्णानां शतं तेन दत्तं भवति शाश्वतम्।<br />He who gives away eighty Ratis of pure gold, obtains the everlasting fruit of giving away one hundred pieces of gold.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>अनड्वाहं तु यो दद्याद् बलवन्तं धुरंधरम्॥ स लिस्तरति दुर्गाणि स्वर्गलोकं च गच्छति।<br />He who gives away a strong bull capable of drawing the plough, does not certainly meet with any calamity; he finally goes to heaven.</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>वसुन्धरां तु यो दद्याद् द्विजाय विदुरात्मने।॥ दातारं ह्यनुगच्छन्ति सर्वे कामाभिवाञ्छिताः।<br />He who gives away land to a learned Brahmana, has all his desires fulfilled.</p>
<p id='27'><a href='#27'></a>पृच्छन्ति चात्र दातारं वदन्ति पुरुषा भुवि॥ अध्वनि क्षीणगात्राश्च पांसुपादावगुण्ठिताः। तेषामेव श्रमार्तानां यो ह्यन्नं कथयेद् बुधः॥ अन्नदातृसमः सोऽपि कीयंते नात्र संशयः।<br />The tired traveller, with weakened limbs and with feet besmeared with dust, asks for the name of him who gives him food. There are men who answer him by telling him the name. That wise man who informs the toil-worn travellers the name of the persons who give them food is certainly considered equal in virtue as the giver of food himself.</p>
<p id='28'><a href='#28'></a>तस्मात् त्वं सर्वदानानि हित्वान्नं सम्प्रयच्छ हा॥ न हीदृशं पुण्यफलं विचित्रमिह विद्यते। यथाशक्ति च यो दद्यादन्नं विप्रेषु संस्कृतम्॥ स तेन कर्मणाऽऽमोति प्रजापतिसलोकताम्।<br />O Yudhishthira, Therefore (even) abstaining from other kinds of gifts, give away food. There is no virtue so great as that of giving well-cooked and pure food to the Brahmanas according to one's ability. That man by his this act obtains the companionship of Prajapati.</p>
<p id='29'><a href='#29'></a>अन्नमेव विशिष्टं हि तस्मात् परतरं न च॥ अन्नं प्रजापतिश्चोक्तः स च संवत्सरो मतः। संवत्सरस्तु यज्ञोऽसौ सर्वं यज्ञे प्रतिष्ठितम्॥<br />There is no gift superior to that of food. The food is the foremost and the first of all things. It is said that food is Prajapati. Prajapati (again) is considered as year and the year is sacrifice.</p>
<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>तस्मात् सर्वाणि भूतानि स्थावराणि चराणि च। तस्मादन्नं विशिष्टं हि सर्वेभ्य इति विश्रुतम्॥<br />From sacrifice all mobile and immobile creatures take their birth. For this reason it has been heard by us that food is the foremost of all things.</p>
<p id='31'><a href='#31'></a>येषां तटाकानि महोदकानि वाप्यश्च कूपाश्च प्रतिश्रयाश्च। अन्नस्य दानं मधुरा च वाणी यमस्य ते निर्वचना भवन्ति॥<br />Those, that give away lakes and large tanks, wells and ponds, shelter and food with sweet words, have not to bear the up-braiding of Yama.</p>
<p id='32'><a href='#32'></a>धान्यं श्रमेणार्जितवित्तसंचितं विप्रे सुशीले च प्रयच्छते यः। वसुन्धरा तस्य भवेत् सुतुष्टा धारां वसूनां प्रतिमुञ्चतीव॥<br />Earth is always satisfied with that man who gives rice and wealth earned by his own labour to the Brahmanas whose behaviour is good. She pours upon such a man showers of wealth.</p>
<p id='33'><a href='#33'></a>अन्नदाः प्रथमं यान्ति सत्यवाक् तदनन्तरम्। अयाचितप्रदाता च समं यान्ति त्रयो जनाः॥<br />The giver of food walks first, then follows the speaker of truth; and then the man who gives away to a person who does not ask. But all these three go to the same place.</p>
<p id='34'><a href='#34'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच कौतूहलसमुत्पन्नः पर्यपृच्छद् युधिष्ठिरः। मार्कण्डेयं महात्मानं पुनरेव सहानुजः॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Being filled with curiosity, Yudhishthira, with his brothers, again asked the illustrious Markandeya.</p>

What is its measurement? How does a man pass over it and by what meant? Tell me all this.</p>
<p id='36'><a href='#36'></a>मार्कण्डेय उवाच सर्वगुह्यतमं प्रश्न पवित्रमृषिसंस्तुतम्। कथयिष्यामि ते राजन् धर्म्य धर्मभृतां वर॥<br />Markandeya said : O king, O foremost of all virtuous men, your this question relates to a great mystery. It is sacred and it is much praised by the Rishis. I shall speak to you about this Dharma.</p>
<p id='37'><a href='#37'></a>षडशीतिसहस्राणि योजनानां नराधिप। यमलोकस्य चाध्वानमन्तरं मानुषस्य च॥<br />O ruler of men, the distance of the region of Yama from the abode of men is eighty-six thousand yojanas.</p>

There is no water there and it is terrible to look at. There is nowhere in that region any shade of any tree, any water and any resting place, in which the traveller when fatigued, may take rest for some time.</p>
<p id='39'><a href='#39'></a>नीयते यमदूतैस्तु यमस्याज्ञाकरैर्बलात्॥ नराः स्त्रियस्तथैवान्ये पृथिव्यां जीवसंज्ञिताः।<br />Along this path are forcibly taken by messenger of Yama, obedient to his command, all men and women and all creatures that have life.</p>

Those that have given. umbrellas thus (to the Brahmanas) go along this path with umbrellas, warding off the sun's rays.</p>

Those that have given cloths go along attired in cloths and those that have not given cloths go along naked,</p>

Those that have given lights go along in great happiness lighting the way before them.</p>

O son of Pandu, he who fasts for three nights taking only one meal without a second goes to a region free from disease and anxiety. The water has this excellent property that it produces happiness in the region of the dead.</p>

Weakened with travelling and besmeared with the dust on this way, the traveller asks for the name of him who gives food and comes in hope to his house to worship him with all care, for he is a great Brahmana.</p>

Before her delivery is complete, a cow with her calf in the air in the course of falling from the uterus to the earth is to be considered as equal to the earth herself.</p>

As an offering of ghee to Agnis is never in vain, so a gift to the Brahmanas learned in the Vedas is never in vain.</p>
<p id='64'><a href='#64'></a>मन्युप्रहरणा विप्रा न विप्राः शस्त्रयोधिनः। निहन्युर्मन्युना विप्रा वज्रपाणिरिवासुरान्॥<br />The Brahinanas have anger as their weapon; they never fight with weapons made of iron or steel. The Brahmanas kill their enemies with anger, as the wielder of thunder killed the Asuras.</p>
