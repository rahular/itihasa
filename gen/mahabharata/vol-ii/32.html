<h3>None: Chapter 32</h3><h4>The conversation between Draupadi and Yudhishthira</h4><p id='1'>द्रौपद्युवाच नावमन्ये न गर्हे चधर्मं पार्थ कथंचन। ईश्वरं कुत एवाहमवमस्ये प्रजापतिम्॥<br />Draupadi said : I never disregard or speak ill of religion, O son of Pritha; why should I disregard God, the lord of creations?</p>
<p id='2'>आर्ताहं प्रलपामीदमिति मां विद्धि भारत। भूयश्च विलपिष्यामि सुमनास्त्वं निबोध मे॥<br />O descendant of Bharata, consider me raving as being stricken with misery, listen to me, I shall again bewail.</p>
<p id='3'>कर्म खल्विह कर्तव्यं जानतामित्रकर्शन। अकर्माणो हि जीवन्ति स्थावरा नेतरे जनाः॥<br />O represser of enemies, forsooth every conscious being should engage in actions in this world; it is only the immobile and not even other creatures that can live without action.</p>
<p id='4'>यावद्गोस्तनपानाच्च यावच्छायोपसेवनात्। जन्तवः कर्मणा वृत्तिमाप्नुवन्ति युधिष्ठिर॥<br />Immediately after the birth the calf sucks the mother's teat. (People feel distress) as soon as incantations are performed on their statues; the creatures, O Yudhishthira, deserve the character of their lives according to pristine actions.</p>
<p id='5'>जङ्गमेषु विशेषेण मनुष्या भरतर्षभ। इच्छन्ति कर्मणा वृत्तिमवाप्तुं प्रेत्य चेह च॥<br />O foremost of Bharatas, this is the difference of man from mobile creatures, that he aspires to like his course of life both in this world and in the next by means of his acts.</p>
<p id='6'>उत्थानमभिजानन्ति सर्वभूतानि भारत। प्रत्यक्षं फलमश्नन्ति कर्मणां लोकसाक्षिकम्॥<br />O descendant of Bharata, all creatures perceive the impression of the pristine life and they visibly reap in this world the fruits of their acts.</p>
<p id='7'>सर्वे हि स्वं समुत्थानमुपजीवन्ति जन्तवः। अपिधाता विधाता च यथायमुदके बकः॥<br />All creatures live according to the impression of the pristine life, even the creatures and the ordainers of the universe like a crane that lives on the water.</p>
<p id='8'>अकर्मणां वै भूतानां वृत्तिः स्यान्न हि काचन। तदेवाभिप्रपद्येत न विहन्यात् कदाचन॥<br />The course of life for a creatures that does not act is impossible; for them there is action and never inaction.</p>
<p id='9'>स्वकर्म कुरु मा ग्लासी: कर्मणा भव दंशितः। कृतं हि योऽभिजानाति सहस्रे सोऽस्ति नास्ति च॥<br />You should therefore act and never incur censure by leaving affection; cover yourself with action as with an armour. There might not be one in a thousand who does not truly understand the utility of work.</p>
<p id='10'>तस्य चापि भवेत् कार्यं विवृद्धौ रक्षणे तथा। भक्ष्यमाणो ह्यनादानात् क्षीयेत् हिमवानपि॥<br />One should act either for increasing or protecting his wealth; if spent without being earned it vanishes although it be like (the mount) Himavana.</p>
<p id='11'>उत्सीदेरन् प्रजाः सर्वा न कुर्युः कर्म चेद् भुवि। तथा ह्येता न वधैरन् कर्म चेदफलं भवेत्॥<br />All creatures would have been exterminated if there were no action; if acts had born no fruits they would not have multiplied.</p>
<p id='12'>अपि चाप्यफलं कर्म पश्यामः कुर्वतो जनान्। नान्यथा ह्यपि गच्छन्ति वृत्ति लोकाः कथंचन॥<br />It is sometimes observed that creatures perform acts that give them no fruits; for without action the course of life would be an impossibility.</p>
<p id='13'>यश्च दिष्टपरो लोके यश्चापि हठवादिकः। उभावपि शठावेतौ कर्मबुद्धिः प्रशस्यते॥<br />Whoever in this world believe in Destiny and whoever in chance are both the worst of people; those only are praiseworthy who believe in the efficacy of acts.</p>
<p id='14'>यो हि दिष्टमुपासीनो निर्विचेष्टः सुखं शयेत्। अवसीदेत् स दुर्बुद्धिरामो घट इवोदके॥<br />He, who has been at ease without any action and believing in Destiny, is soon consumed like an unburnt earthen pot in water.</p>
<p id='15'>तथैव हठदुर्बुद्धिः शक्तः कर्मण्यकर्मकृत्। आसीत न चिरं जीवेदनाथ इव दुर्बलः॥<br />So also that man, who believes in chance and who, though capable of work, does not work, does not live long, for his life is one of weakness and helplessness.</p>
<p id='16'>अकस्मादिह यः कश्चिदर्थं प्राप्नोति पूरुषः। तं हठेनेति मन्यन्ते स हि यत्नो न कस्यचित्॥<br />If a person in the world attains, by accident, to an accession of wealth-people consider it derived from chance for none has tried for it.</p>
<p id='17'>यच्चापि किंचित् पुरुषो दिष्टं नाम भजत्युत। दैवेन विधिना पार्थ तद् दैवमिति निश्चितम्॥<br />O son of Pritha, whatever good fortune a person acquires in consequence of religious rites is called Providential.</p>
<p id='18'>यत् स्वयं कर्मणा किंचित् फलमाप्नोति पूरुषः। प्रत्यक्षमेतल्लोकेषु तत् पौरुषमिति श्रुतम्॥<br />The fruit, that a person reaps by acting himself and which is the direct outcome of his actions, is considered as a proof of manliness.</p>

<p id='20'>एवं हठाच्च दैवाच्च स्वभावात् कर्मणस्तथा। यानि प्राप्नोति पुरुषस्तत् फलं पूर्वकर्मणाम्।।२<br />Whatever is thus acquired accidentally, providentially or spontaneously by a person is the outcome of his pristine actions.</p>
<p id='21'>धातापि हि स्वकर्मैव तैस्तैर्हेतुभिरीश्वरः। विदधाति विभज्येह फलं पूर्वकृतं नृणाम्॥<br />And judging according to their pristine actions, the good and bad, the ordainer of the universe distributes among men, their portions in this world.</p>

<p id='23'>कारणं तस्य देहोऽयंधातुः कर्मणि वर्तते। स यथा प्रेरयत्येनं तथायं कुरुतेऽवशः॥<br />This body is the instrument of God for actions; inert in itself, it performs what is urged on by God.</p>
<p id='24'>तेषु तेषु हि कृत्येषु विनियोक्ता महेश्वरः। सर्वभूतानि कौन्तेय कारयत्यवशान्यपि॥<br />O son of Kunti, it is the supreme Lord of all who makes all creatures do what they do, though they themselves are all inert.</p>
<p id='25'>मनसार्थान् विनिश्चित्य पश्चात् प्राप्नोति कर्मणा। बुद्धिपूर्वं स्वयं वीर पुरुषस्तत्र कारणम्॥<br />O hero, having settled upon some object in mind, a man carries it out into action aided by his intelligence; man is himself therefore the cause.</p>
<p id='26'>संख्यातुं नैव शक्यानि कर्माणि पुरुषर्षभ। अगारनगराणां हि सिद्धिः पुरुषहैतुकी॥ तिले तैलं गवि क्षीरं काष्ठे पावकमन्ततः। धियाधीरो विजानीयादुपायं चास्य सिद्धये॥<br />O best of men, the number of actions cannot be ascertained for towns and palaces are the result of man's acts. By the aid of their intelligence, intelligent men know that oil may be had from sesame, curds from milk and that food may be cooked by means of igniting fuel; they know the means for accomplishing them.</p>
<p id='27'>ततः प्रवर्तते पश्चात् कारणैस्तस्य सिद्धये। तां सिद्धिमुपजीवन्ति कर्मजामिह जन्तवः॥<br />Thereupon they set themselves, by instruinents, to accomplishing them; and creatures maintain their lives by the results acquired in these directions by their own acts.</p>
<p id='28'>कुशलेन कृतं कर्म क; साधु स्वनुष्ठितम्। इदं त्वकुशलेनेति विशेषादुपलभ्यते॥<br />If a work is done by a clever work-man it is done well; from the difference in execution another work may be said to be that of an unskilled hand.</p>
<p id='29'>इष्टापूर्तफलं न स्यान्न शिष्यो न गुरुर्भवेत्। पुरुषः कर्मसाध्येषु स्याच्चेदयमकारणम्॥<br />If a person were not himself the instrument of his acts, the sacrifices would not bear any fruits in his case nor would anybody be a disciple or preceptor.</p>
<p id='30'>कर्तृत्वादेव पुरुषः कर्मसिद्धौ प्रशस्यते। असिद्धौ निन्द्यते चापि कर्मनाशात् कथं त्विह॥<br />It is because a person is himself the instrument of his action that he is praised when or he acquires success, so the doer is censured when he is unsuccessful; nothing else exists.</p>
<p id='31'>सर्वमेव हठेनैके दैवेनैके वदन्त्युत। पुंसः प्रयत्न केचित्त्रैधमेतन्निरुच्यते॥ न चैवेतावता कार्यं मन्यन्त इति चापरे। अस्ति सर्वमदृश्यं तु दिष्टं चैव तथा हठः॥<br />Some say that everything is the outcome of chance, some say everything is providential, whereas others hold that this, is not so, but everything that is said to be the outcome of Destiny or chance is the result of pristine actions.</p>
<p id='32'>दृश्यते हि हठाच्चैव दिष्टाच्चार्थस्य संततिः। किंचिद् दैवाद्धठात् किंचित् किंचिदेव स्वभावतः।३४॥ पुरुषः फलमाप्नोति चतुर्थं नात्र कारणम्। कुशलाः प्रतिजानन्ति ये वै तत्त्वविदो जनाः॥<br />It is seen that wealth proceeds from chance Destiny; something accidental and something natural. In the acquisition of fruits for a man, there is not the fourth cause; this is said by those who are cognizant of truth and well-versed in knowledge.</p>
<p id='33'>तथैवधाता भूतानामिष्टानिष्टफलप्रदः। यदि न स्यान्न भूतानां कृपणो नाम कश्चन॥<br />If God himself were not the bestower of good or bad fruits then among creatures there would not be any miserable being.</p>
<p id='34'>यं यमर्थमभिप्रेप्सुः कुरुते कर्म पूरुषः। तत्तत् सफलमेव स्याद् यदि न स्यात् पुरा कृतम्।<br />If pristine actions had no existence then all purposes for which a man would work should prove successful.</p>
<p id='35'>त्रिद्वारामर्थसिद्धिं तु नानुपश्यन्ति ये नराः। तथैवानर्थसिद्धिं च यथा लोकास्तथैव ते॥<br />Those persons, who do not observe these three doors for the accomplishment of objects as well as for the failure, are dull and exist like the body itself.</p>
<p id='36'>कर्तव्यमेव कर्मेति मनोरेष विनिश्चयः। एकान्तेन ह्यनीहोऽयं पराभवति पूरुषः॥<br />Man should always act; for this is the conclusion of Manu; a person that does not act is always defeated.</p>
<p id='37'>कुर्वतो हि भवत्येव प्रायेणेह युधिष्ठिर। एकान्तफलसिद्धिं तु न विन्दत्यलसः क्वचित्॥<br />A man of action in this world, O Yudhishthira, generally meets with success; the idle however never acquire success.</p>
<p id='38'>असम्भवे त्वस्य हेतुः प्रायश्चित्तं तु लक्षयेत्। कृते कर्मणि राजेन्द्र तथानृण्यमवाप्नुते॥<br />If success becomes impossible a person should remove the difficulties; when engaged in action, O king, he is freed from debts (whether he is successful or not).</p>

<p id='40'>अनर्थाः संशयावस्थाः सिद्ध्यन्ते मुक्त संशयाः। धीरा नराः कर्मरता ननु निःसंशयाः क्वचित्॥<br />Intelligent persons engaged confidently in acts consider all who are diffident as doubting and unsuccessful.</p>
<p id='41'>एकान्तेन ह्यनर्थोऽयं वर्ततेऽस्मासु साम्प्रतम्। स तु निःसंशयं न स्यात् त्वयि कर्मण्यवस्थिते॥<br />Now we are overtaken by misfortune and if you engage in action this misfortune will certainly be removed.</p>
<p id='42'>अथवा सिद्धिरेव स्यादभिमानं तदेव ते। वृकोदरस्य बीभत्सोमा॑त्रोश्च यमयोरपि॥<br />Even if you are unsuccessful it shall be proved to you. Vrikodara, Vivatsu and the twins (that you are unable to take the kingdom).</p>
<p id='43'>अन्येषां कर्म सफलमस्माकमपि वा पुनः। विप्रकर्षण बुध्येत कृतकर्मा यथाफलम्।॥<br />The actions of others have been seen crowned with success and ours might be as well; how can one, performing action, perceive beforehand what would be the result?</p>
<p id='44'>पृथिवीं लागलेनेह भित्त्वा बीजं वपत्युत। आस्तेऽथ कर्षकस्तूष्णीं पर्जन्यस्तत्र कारणम्॥<br />Having tilled the ground with plough one sows the seeds; the tiller then sits silent (for) the clouds are the next cause.</p>
<p id='45'>वृष्टिश्चेन्नानुगृहणीयादनेनास्तत्र कर्षकः। यदन्यः पुरुषः कुर्यात् तत् कृतं सफलं मया॥<br />If however the clouds do not favour him the cultivator is not to blame-he says :-"I have done what others do."</p>
<p id='46'>तच्चेदं फलमस्माकमपराधो न मे क्वचित्। इतिधीरोऽन्ववेक्ष्यैव नात्मानं तत्र गर्हयेत्।।<br />If however I do not meet with success I am not to blame thinking this he contents himself and does not reproach himself.</p>
<p id='47'>कुर्वतो नार्थसिद्धिर्मे भवतीति ह भारत। निर्वेदो नात्र कर्तव्यो द्वावन्यौ ह्या कारणम्॥<br />O descendant of Bharata, no one should despair saying, “I am working still I do not succeed," for besides exertion there are two other ause for success.</p>
<p id='48'>सिद्धिर्वाप्यथवासिद्धिरप्रवृत्तिरतोऽन्यथा। बहूनां समवाये हि भावानां कर्म सिद्ध्यति॥<br />Success or failure, no one should despair, for success in action depends upon the union of many circumstances.</p>
<p id='49'>गुणाभावे फलं न्यूनं भवत्यफलमेव च। अनारम्भे हि न फलं न गुणो दृश्यते क्वचित्॥<br />One element wanting proportionate success does not come or nothing at all; if however no exertion is made no success is acquired, nor any quality is seen.</p>
