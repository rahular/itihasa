<p id='18'>दह्यमानेन तु हृदा रामोऽभ्यपतदाश्रमम्। स ददर्श तदा गृधं निहतं पर्वतोपमम्॥<br />Rama then with a burning heart quickly proceeded forwards the hermitage and (on the way) he beheld the vulture, huge as mountain, in his last moments.</p>
<p id='19'>राक्षसं शङ्कमानस्तं विकृष्य बलवद् धनुः। अभ्यधावत काकुत्स्थस्ततस्तं सहलक्ष्मणः॥<br />Suspecting him to be a Rakshasa, the descendant of Kakustha drawing his bow powerfully, rushed at him with Lakshmana.</p>
