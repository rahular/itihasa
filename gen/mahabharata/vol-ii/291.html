<h3>RAMOPAKHYANA PARVA: Chapter 291</h3><h4>The installation of Rama</h4><p id='1'>मार्कण्डेय उवाच स हत्वा रावणं क्षुद्रं राक्षसेन्द्रं सुरद्विषम्। बभूव हृष्टः ससुहृद् रामः सौमित्रिणा सह॥<br />Markandeya said : Having killed the mean-minded Ravana, the lord of the Rakshasas and the enemy of the gods, great indeed was the joy of Rama and the son of Sumitra.</p>
<p id='2'>ततो हते दशग्रीवे देवाः सर्षिपुरोगमाः। आशीर्भिर्जययुक्ताभिरानचुस्तं महाभुजम्॥<br />The ten-necked being slain, the celestials with the Rishis at their head eulogised the mighty-armed one by uttering blessings indicative of victory,</p>
<p id='3'>रामं कमलपत्राक्षं तुष्टुवुः सर्वदेवताः। गन्धर्वाः पुष्पवर्षेच वाग्भिश्च त्रिदशालयाः॥<br />All the gods together with the Gandharvas and the inhabitants of the celestials regions delighted Rama gifted with eyes resembling lotus-petals by (chanting) hymns (in his praise) and showering flowers (over his head).</p>
<p id='4'>पूजयित्वा यथा रामं प्रतिजग्मुर्यथागतम्। तन्महोत्सवसंकाशमासीदाकाशमच्युत॥<br />Having thus worshipped Rama, they returned to their respective abodes. And O being of everlasting fame, it then appeared as if a great carnival was being held in the firmament.</p>
<p id='5'>ततो हत्वा दशग्रीवं लङ्कां रामो महायशाः। विभीषणाय प्रददौ प्रभुः परपुरञ्जयः॥<br />Then the highly-renowned lord Rama, the destroyer of his enemy's cities, having slain Ravana, gave Lanka to Vibhishana.</p>
<p id='6'>ततः सीतां पुरस्कृत्य विभीषणपुरस्कृताम्। अविध्यो नाम सुप्रज्ञो वृद्धामात्यो विनिर्ययौ॥<br />Then Avindhya, the wise and old adviser of Ravana, preceded by Sita who was herself preceded by Vibhishana, set out from Lanka.</p>
<p id='7'>उवाच च महात्मानं काकुत्स्थं दैन्यमास्थितः। प्रतीच्छ देवीं सद्वृत्तां महात्मञ्जानकीमिति॥<br />And he (Avindhya) with great humility said to the high-souled descendant of Kakustha, “O high-souled one, accept this divine lady, the daughter of Janaka, of spotless character."</p>
<p id='8'>एतच्छ्रुत्वा वचस्तस्मादवतीर्य रथोत्तमात्। बाष्पेणापिहितां सीतां ददशेक्ष्वाकुनन्दनः॥<br />Hearing these words, Rama, the descendant of Kakustha got down from that excellent car and saw Sita weeping profusely.</p>
<p id='9'>तां दृष्ट्वा चारुसर्वाङ्गी यानस्थां शोककर्शिताम् मलोपचितसर्वाङ्गी जटिलां कृष्णवाससम्॥<br />And beholding her of faultless proportions, seated in the vehicle weighed down with grief, covered all over with dirt, having matted locks and wearing a dirty cloth.</p>
<p id='10'>उवाच रामो वैदेही परामर्शविशङ्कितः। गच्छ वैदेहि मुक्ता त्वं यत् कार्यं तन्मया कृतम्॥<br />Rama, suspecting the loss of her virtue, addressed the daughter of the king of Mithila thus, "O Princess of Videha, go (wheresoever you like)! You are now liberated (from your captivity). I have done my duty.</p>
<p id='11'>मामासाद्य पतिं भद्रे न त्वं राक्षसवेश्मनि। जरां व्रजेथा इति मे निहतोऽसौ निशाचरः॥<br />O gentle creatures, I have killed that nightranger thinking that myself being your husband you should not grow old in the abode of the Rakshasa.</p>
<p id='12'>कथं ह्यस्मद्विधो जातु जानन् धर्मविनिश्चयम्। परहस्तगतां नारी मुहूर्तमपि धारयेत्॥<br />How can men like us, well acquainted with moral duty, accept for even a moment, a woman carried off by another?</p>
<p id='13'>सुवृत्तामसुवृत्तां वाप्यहं त्वामद्य मैथिलि। नोत्सहे परिभोगाय श्वावलीढं हविर्यथा॥<br />O daughter of the king of Mithila, whether you are of pure or impure character, I dare not enjoy you, who are now like sanctified butter lapped by a dog?"</p>
<p id='14'>ततः सा सहसा बाला तच्छ्रुत्वा दारुणं वचः। पपात देवी व्यथिता निकृत्ता कदली यथा॥<br />That divine lady, hearing these cruel words (of Rama) was sorely afflicted with grief and suddenly fell down (to the ground) like a plantain tree torn up by the roots.</p>
<p id='15'>योऽप्यस्या हर्षसम्भूतो मुखरागस्तदाभवत्। क्षणेन स पुनर्नष्टो निःश्वास इव दर्पणे॥<br />And the lively colour of her face sprung from her delight (at seeing Rama) as quickly disappeared as breath on a mirror.</p>
<p id='16'>ततस्ते हरयः सर्वे तच्छ्रुत्वा रामभाषितम्। गतासुकल्पा निश्चेष्टा बभूवुः सहलक्ष्मणाः॥<br />Then, hearing these words of Rama all the monk ys together with Lakshmana became motionless as death itself.</p>
<p id='17'>ततो देवो विशुद्धात्मा विमानेन चतुर्मुखः। पायोनिर्जगत्स्रष्टा दर्शयामास राघवम्॥<br />Then the pure-souled and the four-faced god (Brahma) the creator of the universe, who sprang from a lotus (on the nave of Vishnu), appeared before the descendant of Raghu on a chariot.</p>
<p id='18'>शक्रश्चाग्निश्च वायुश्च यमो वरुण एव च। यक्षाधिपश्च भगवांस्तथा सप्तर्षयोऽमलाः॥<br />(Then) Shakra, Agni, Vayu, Yama, Varuna, the divine lord of the Yakshas, the seven holy sages (whom Brahma created first of all).</p>
<p id='19'>राजा दशरथश्चैव दिव्यभास्वरमूर्तिमान्। विमानेन महाहेण हंसयुक्तेन भास्वता॥<br />And king Dasharatha also in his celestials appearance and robes and mounted on a highly-resplendent and bright car (appeared on the scene).</p>
<p id='20'>ततोऽन्तरिक्षं तत् सर्वं देवगन्धर्वसंकुलम्। शुशुभे तारकाचित्रं शरदीव नभस्तलम्॥<br />Then the firmament crowded with the gods and the Gandharvas shone like the autumnal sky studded with stars.</p>
<p id='21'>तत उत्थाय वैदेही तेषां मध्ये यशस्विनी। उवाच वाक्यं कल्याणी रामं पृथुलवक्षसम्॥<br />Then rising in the midst of them, the blessed and renowned princess of Videha spoke these words to the broad-chested Rama.</p>
<p id='22'>राजपुत्र न ते दोषं करोमि विदिता हि ते। गतिः स्त्रीणां नराणां च शृणु चेदं वचो मम॥<br />"O prince, I do not blame you; (for) you are conversant with the ways of men and women. (Yet) listen to these my words.</p>
<p id='23'>अन्तश्चरति भूतानां मातरिश्वा सदागतिः। स मे विमुञ्चतु प्राणान् यदि पापं चराम्यहम्॥<br />The air which is always in motion, moves within (the hearts of) all the creatures. If I have sinned, let it forsake my life.</p>
<p id='24'>अग्निरापस्तथाऽऽकाशं पृथिवी वायुरेव च। विमुञ्चन्तु मम प्राणान् यदि पापं चराम्यहम्॥<br />And not only let air, but let fire, water, space and earth forsake my life if I have erred.</p>

<p id='26'>ततोऽन्तरिक्षे वागासीत् सुभगा लोकसाक्षिणी। पुण्या संहर्षणी तेषां वानराणां महात्मनाम्॥<br />Then a sacred and auspicious voice, joyful to the high-souled monkeys, was heard in the firmament which made the whole universe bear testimony to it.</p>
<p id='27'>वायुरुवाच भो भो राघव सत्यं वै वायुरस्मि सदागतिः। अपापा मैथिली राजन् संगच्छ सह भार्यया॥<br />Vayu said: O descendant of Raghu, (what Sita has said) is true. I am the wind (god) and ever in motion. O king, the princess of Mithila is pure. Be united with your wife.</p>
