<h3>None: Chapter 231</h3><h4>Birth of Skanda</h4><p id='1'>मार्कण्डेय उवाच यदा स्कन्देन मातृणामेवमेतत् प्रियं कृतम्। अथैनमब्रवीत् स्वाहा मम पुत्रस्त्वमौरसः॥<br />Markandeya said : When Skanda had done all these favourite works of the mothers, Svaha appeared before him and said, “You are my son.</p>

<p id='3'>स्वाहोवाच दक्षस्याहं प्रिया कन्या स्वाहा नाम महाभुजा बाल्यात्प्रभृति नित्यं च जातकामा हुताशने॥ न स मां कामिनी पुत्र सम्यक् जानाति पावकः। इच्छामि शाश्वतं वासं वस्तुं पुत्र सहाग्निना॥<br />Svaha said: O mighty-armed one, O child, I am the favourite daughter of Daksha. My name is Svaha; from my youth I am in love with Agni, but that deity does not understand my feelings. I desire to live forever with him.</p>
<p id='4'>स्कन्द उवाच हव्यं कव्यं च यत्किचिद् द्विजानां मन्त्रसंस्तुतम्। होष्यन्त्यग्नौ सदा देवि स्वाहेत्युक्त्वा समुद्धृतम्॥ अद्यप्रभृति दास्यन्ति सुवृत्ताः सत्पथे स्थिताः। एवमग्निस्त्वया सार्धं सदा वत्स्यति शोभने॥<br />Skanda said: O lady, O beautiful one, from this day all the oblations that virtuous, men, who do not deviate from the path of virtue, will offer to the celestials and the Pitris with Mantras uttered by the Brahmanas shall always be offered to Agni coupled with the name of Svaha. Thus, O excellent one, you will always live with Agni.</p>

<p id='8'>उमायोन्यां च रुद्रेण शुक्रं सिक्तं महात्मना। अस्मिन् गिरौ निपतितं मिञ्जिकामिञ्जिकं यतः॥ सम्भूतं लोहितोदे तु शुक्रशेषमवापतत्। सूर्यरश्मिषु चाप्यन्यदन्यच्चैवापतद् भुवि॥ आसक्तमन्यद् वृक्षेषु तदेवं पञ्चधापतत्। तत्र ते विविधाकारा गणा ज्ञेया मनीषिभिः। तव पारिषदा घोरा य एते पिशिताशिनः॥ एवमस्त्विति चाप्युक्त्वा महासेनो महेश्वरम्। अपूजयदमेयात्मा पितरं पितृवत्सलः॥<br />(Slokas to 13 not translated for obvious reason).</p>
<p id='9'>मार्कण्डेय उवाच अर्कपुष्पैस्तु ते पञ्च गणाः पूज्या धनार्थिभिः। व्याधिप्रशमनार्थं च तेषां पूजां समाचरेत्॥<br />Men who are desirous of acquiring wealth should worship these five classes of spirits with the sun-flower. They should also be worshipped for the alleviation of diseases.</p>
<p id='10'>मिञ्जिकामिञ्जिकं चैव मिथुनं रुद्रसम्भवम्। नमस्कार्यं सदैवेह बालानां हितमिच्छता॥ स्त्रियो मानुषमांसादा वृद्धिका नाम नामतः। वृक्षेषु जातास्ता देव्यो नमस्कार्याः प्रजार्थिभिः॥ एवमेते पिशाचानामसंख्येय गणाः स्मृताः। घण्टायाः सपताकायाः शृणु मे सम्भवं नृप॥<br />Minjika and Minjika, begotten by Rudra should always be worshipped by those who desire the good of their children. Those who desire to have children born to them should always worship those female spirits that live on human flesh and that are produced in trees. Thus all Pishachas are divided into innumerable classes. O king, hear now the origin of the bells and standards of Skanda.</p>
<p id='11'>ऐरावतस्य घण्टे द्वे वैजयन्त्याविति श्रुते। गुहस्य ते स्वयं दत्ते क्रमेणानाय्य धीमता॥<br />Airavata had two Bells named Vaijayanti. The intelligent Indra brought them and personally gave them to Guha.</p>

<p id='16'>संतानकवनैः फुल्लैः करवीरवनैरपि। पारिजातवनैश्चैव जपाशोकवनैस्तथा।।२३। कदम्बतरुषण्डैश्च दिव्यैर्मगगणैरपि। दिव्यैः पक्षिगणैश्चैव शुशुभे श्वेतपर्वतः॥ तत्र देवगणा: सर्वे सर्वे देवर्षयस्तथा। मेघतूर्यरवाश्चैव क्षुब्धोदधिसमस्वनाः॥ तन्त्र दिव्याच गन्धर्वा नृत्यन्तेऽप्सररास्तथा! इष्टानां तत्र भूतानां श्रूयते निनदो महान्॥<br />The white mountain was adorned with charming forests full of blossoming Santaka flowers and with forests of Karbira, Parijata, Japa and Ashoka trees and also with wild tracts, overgrown with Kadamba trees; it abounded in innumerable celestials deer and birds. The roaring clouds served the purpose of musical instruments. It sounded like the murmurs of an agitated sea. The celestials, the Gandharvas and the Apsaras began to dance. There rose a loud sound of joy from the merriment of all creatures.</p>
<p id='17'>एवं सेन्द्रं जगत् सर्वं श्वेतपर्वतसंस्थितम्। प्रहृष्टं प्रेक्षते स्कन्दं न च ग्लायति दर्शनात्॥<br />It appeared as if Indra with all the worlds had been transferred to the white mountain. All looked at Skanda with great satisfaction. None felt tired in doing so.</p>
<p id='18'>मार्कण्डेय उवाच यदाभिषिक्तो भगवान सैनापत्येन पावकिः। तदा सम्प्रस्थितः श्रीमान् हृष्टो भद्रवटं हरः॥ रथेनादित्यवर्णेन पार्वत्या सहितः प्रभुः। सहस्रं तस्य सिंहानां तस्मिन् युक्तं रथोत्तमे॥ उत्पपात दिवं शुभं कालेनाभिप्रचोदितम्। ते पिबन्त इवाकाशं त्रासयन्तश्चराचरान्॥<br />When that exalted son of Pavaka was installed as the generallissimo of the celestials army, that handsome and happy lord, riding with Parvati on a car and shining as effulgent as the sun, went to a place called Bhadravata. To his beautiful chariot were yoked thousands of lions and it was driven by Kala (himself). They passed through space and seemed as if they were about to devour the sky.</p>
<p id='19'>सिंहा नभस्यगच्छन्त नदन्तश्चारुकेसराः। तस्मिन् रथे पशुपतिः स्थितो भात्युमया सह॥<br />Striking terror into the hearts of all creatures in the mobile and immobile worlds, those lions flitted through the sky uttering fearful growls. In that chariot was seated Pashupati (Shiva) with the mother Uma.</p>

The great Yaksha Amogha with his followers, the Jrimbhaka Yakshas and other Rakshasas adorned with garlands of flowers were in the right wing of the army. Many celestials warriors with the Vasus and the Rudras, marched in the right wing of the army. Then marched the terrible Yama in company with Death followed by hundreds of fearful diseases. Behind him was carried the fearful, sharp and well-adorned trident of Shiva called Vijaya. The exalted lord of waters Varuna with his terrible Pasha (weapon) surrounded by innumerable aquatic animals marched slowly with the trident. The trident of the Vijaya was followed by Pattisha (weapon) of Rudra guarded.</p>

O king, he was followed by the prosperity-bound Indra accompanied with the Royal sages singing the praises of Vrishadhvaja (Shiva).</p>
<p id='28'>गौरी विद्याथ गान्धारी केशिनी मित्रसाह्वया॥ सावित्र्या सह सर्वास्ताः पार्वत्या यान्ति पृष्ठतः। तत्र विद्यागणा: सर्वे ये केचित् कविभिः कृताः॥<br />Gauri, Vidhya, Gandhari, Keshini, Mitra and Savitri, all followed Parvati and so did also all those that are Vidhyas, created by the learned.</p>

<p id='30'>व्यापृतस्तु श्मशाने यो नित्यं रुद्रस्य वै सखा। पिङ्गलो नाम यक्षेन्द्रो लोकस्यानन्ददायकः॥ एभिश्च सहितो देवस्तत्र याति यथासुखम्। अचतः पृष्ठतश्चैव न हि तस्य गतिर्बुवा॥<br />That foremost of Yakshas, named Pingala, the friend of Rudra, who is always present in the place where corpses are burnt and who is agreeable to all people, merrily marched with him, sometime going in front of the army and sometime falling behind it, his movements were not certain.</p>
<p id='31'>रुद्र सत्कर्मभिर्माः पूजयन्तीह दैवतम्। शिवमित्येव यं प्राहुरीशं रुद्रं पितामहम्॥ भावस्तु विविधाकारैः पूजयन्ति महेश्वरम्। देवसेनापतिस्त्वेवं देवसेनाभिरावृतः। अनुगच्छति देवेशं ब्रह्मण्यः कृत्तिकासुतः॥ अथावबीन्महासेनं महादेवो बृहद् वचः। सप्तमं मारुतस्कन्धं रक्ष नित्यमतन्द्रितः॥<br />Virtuous actions are the offerings with which the deity Rudra is worshipped by mortals. He is also called Shiva, the omnipotent god, the wielder of Pinaka; he is the great god. He is worshipped in various forms. The son of Kritika, the generallissimo of the celestials army, ever respectful to Brahmanas, being thus surrounded by the celestials forces, also followed that lord of the celestials. Then Mahadeva said these weighty words to Mahasena. "Carefully command the seventh army corps of the celestials forces.'</p>
<p id='32'>स्कन्द उवाच सप्तमं मारुतस्कन्धं पालयिष्याम्यहं प्रभो। यदन्यदपि में कार्यं देव तद् वद माचिरम्॥<br />O lord, very well, I shall command, the seventh army corps. Now tell me soon if I am to do any thing else.</p>

<p id='34'>मार्कण्डेय उवाच इत्युक्त्वा विससर्जेनं परिष्वज्य महेश्वरः। विसर्जिते ततः स्कन्दे बभूवौत्पातिकं महत्॥<br />Markandeya said : Having said this, Maheshvara Maheshvara (Shiva) embraced him and then permitted him to go. When Skanda was thus allowed to go, great disasters occurred.</p>
<p id='35'>सहसैव महाराज देवान् सर्वान् प्रमोहयत्। जज्वाल खं सनक्षत्रं प्रमूढं भुवनं भृशम्॥<br />To disturb the equanimity of the celestials. The firmament with the stars was on a blaze. The whole universe became greatly confused.</p>
<p id='36'>चचाल व्यनदच्चोर्वी तमोभूतं जगद् बभौ। ततस्तद् दारुणं दृष्ट्वा क्षुभितः शङ्करस्तदा॥ उमा चैव महाभागा देवाश्च समहर्षयः। ततस्तेषु प्रमूढेषु पर्वताम्बुदसंनिभम्॥ नानाप्रहरणं घोरमदृश्यत् महद् बलम्। तद् वै घोरमसंख्येयं गर्जच्च विविधा गिरः॥ अभ्यद्रवद् रणे देवान् भगवन्तं च शङ्करम्। तैर्विसृष्टान्यनीकेषु बाणजालान्यनेकशः॥<br />The earth tremble I and sent up a rumbling sound. Darkness covered the whole world. Seeing this fearful catastrophy, Shankara (Shiva) with the greatly blessed Uma and with the celestials and the great Rishis became greatly aggrieved. When such confusion overtook them, they saw before them a fearful and mighty army with various weapons; it looked like a mass of clouds and rocks. Those terrible and countless beings, speaking various languages, came where stood Shankara and the celestials. They hurled on the celestials showers of arrows from all directions,</p>
<p id='37'>पर्वताश्च शतघ्यश्च प्रासासिपरिघा गदाः। निपतद्भिश्च तैोरैर्देवानीकं महायुधैः॥ क्षणेन व्यद्रवत् सर्वं विमुखं चाप्यदृश्यत। निकृत्तयोधनागाश्वं कृत्तायुधमहारथम्॥ दानवैरर्दितं सैन्यं देवानां विमुखं बभौ। असुरैर्वध्यमानं तत् पावकैरिव काननम्॥ अपतद् दग्धभूयिष्ठं महाद्रुमवनं यथा। ते विभिन्नशिरोदेहाः प्राद्रवन्तो दिवौकसः॥ न नाथमधिगच्छन्ति वध्यमाना महारणे। अथ तद् विद्रुतं सैन्यं दृष्ट्वा देवः पुरंदरः॥ आश्वासयन्नुवाचेदं बलभिद् दानवादितम्। भयं त्यजत भद्रं वः शूराः शस्त्राणि गृहणत॥<br />And also masses of rocks, maces, clubs, Shataghnis, Prasas and Parighas (all weapons). The celestials army was thrown into great confusion by the shower of those fearful weapons and they began to waver. The Danavas made a great havoc by cutting down the soldiers, horses, elephants, chariots and arins. The celestials forces were then seen to turn their backs upon the enemy. Many of them fell, killed by the Asuras as large trees fall in the forest when a wild fire takes place. The dwellers of heaven fell with their heads cut off from their bodies. They had none to lead them in that fearful battle and they were thus killed by the enemy. Seeing his army unsteady and hard pressed by the Danavas, the lord of the celestials, the slayer of Bala, Purandara, tried to rally them by saying, "O heroes, do not be afraid; may success attend you. Take up your arms.</p>
<p id='38'>कुरुध्वं विक्रमे बुद्धि मा वः काचिद् व्यथा भवेत् जयतैनात् सुदुर्वृत्तान् दानवान् घोरदर्शनान्॥ अभिद्रवत भद्रं वो मया सह महासुरान्। शक्रस्य वचनं श्रुत्वा समाश्वस्ता दिवौकसः॥<br />Resolve upon displaying bravery; you will then meet with no more misfortune and you will then be able to defeat these wicked and terrible wretches, the Danavas. Be blessed; attack the great Danavas with me.” Having heard the words of Shakra, the dwellers of heaven became reassured.</p>
<p id='39'>दानवान् प्रत्ययुध्यन्त शक्रं कृत्वा व्यपाश्रयम्। ततस्ते त्रिदशाः सर्वे मरुतश्च महाबलाः॥<br />And under his leadership they again attacked the Danavas. Thereupon all the celestials and the greatly powerful Marutas.</p>
<p id='40'>प्रत्युद्ययुर्महाभागाः साध्याश्च वसुभिः सह। तैर्विसृष्टान्यनीकेषु क्रुद्धः शस्त्राणि संयुगे॥ शराश्च दैत्यकायेषु पिबन्ति रुधिरं बहु। तेषां देहान् विनिर्भिद्य शरास्ते निशितास्तदा॥ निपतन्तोऽभ्यदृश्यन्त नगेभ्य इव पन्नगाः। तानि दैत्यशरीराणि निर्भिन्नानि स्म सायकैः॥ अपतन् भूतले राजंश्छिन्नाभ्राणीव सर्वशः। ततस्तद् दानवं सैन्यं सर्वैर्देवगणैर्युधि॥<br />Along with the greatly exalted Sadhyas and the Vasus returned to the attack, the arrows which they angrily discharged against the enemy drank a large quantity of blood from the bodies of the Daityas and of their horses and elephants. Their sharp arrows passing through their bodies fell upon the ground looking like so inany snakes falling from the sides of a hill. O_king, the Daityas, thus pierced by the arrows, fell on all sides, looking like so many masses of clouds. Attacked by the celestials on the field of battle, the Danava forces.</p>
<p id='41'>त्रासितं विविधैर्बाणैः कृतं चैव पराङ्मुखम्। अथोत्क्रुष्टं तदा हृष्टैः सर्वैर्देवैरुदायुधैः॥ संहतनि च तूर्याणि प्रावाद्यन्त ह्यनेकशः। एवमन्योन्यसंयुक्तं युद्धमासीत् सुदारुणम्॥<br />Were struck with panic and they wavered at that shower of various arrows. Then the celestials loudly gave vent to their joy with uplifted weapons. The celestials musicians began to play various airs. Thus took place that great battle, so fearful to both sides.</p>
<p id='42'>देवानां दानवानां च मांसशोणितकर्दमम्। अनयो देवलोकस्य सहसैवाभ्यदृश्यत॥ तथा हि दानवा घोरा विनिघ्नन्ति दिवौकसः। ततस्तूर्यप्रणादाश्च भेरीणां च महास्वनः॥ बभूवुर्दानवेन्द्राणां सिहनादाश्च दारुणाः। अथ दैत्यवलाद् घोरान्निष्पपात महाबलः॥ दानवो महिषो नाम प्रगृह्य विपुलं गिरिम्।<br />The battle field was covered with blood and strewn with the bodies of both the Devas and the Danavas. The celestials however, were soon worsted and the fearful Danavas again made a great havoc of the celestials army. The Asura drums were sounded and their shrill bugles were loudly blown. The Danava chiefs sent forth terrific lion-like roars. Then came forward from the fearful Danava army a greatly powerful Danava, named Mahisha with a large mass of rocks in his hands.</p>
<p id='43'>ते तं घरिवादित्यं दृष्ट्वा सम्परिवारितम्॥ तमुद्यतगिरिं राजन् व्यद्रवन्त दिवौकसः।<br />He looked like the sun peeping from amongst a mass of dark clouds. O king, seeing that uplifted mass of rocks about to be hurled on them, the dwellers of heaven fled in confusion.</p>
<p id='44'>अथाभिदुत्य महिषो देवांश्चिक्षेप तं गिरिम्॥ पतता तेन गिरिणा देवसैन्यस्य पार्थिव। भीमरूपेण निहतमयुतं प्रापतद् भुवि॥<br />But they were pursued by Mahisha who hurled on them the rock. O ruler of earth, by the falling of that rock, ten thousand warriors of the celestials army were killed by being crushed to the ground.</p>
<p id='45'>अथ तैर्दानवैः सार्धं महिषस्त्रासयन् सुरान्। अभ्यद्रवद् रणे तूर्णं सिंहः क्षुद्रमृगानिव॥<br />This act of Mahisha struck terror into the hearts of the celestials. With other Danavas, he again attacked them as a lion attacks a herd of small deer.</p>
<p id='46'>तमापतन्तं महिषं दृष्ट्वा सेन्द्रा दिवौकसः। व्यद्रवन्त रणे भीता विकीर्णायुधकेतनाः॥<br />When Indra and the other dwellers of heaven saw that Mahisha was advancing to attack them, they fled leaving behind their arms and colours.</p>
<p id='47'>ततः स महिषः क्रुद्धस्तूर्णं रुद्ररथं ययौ। अभिद्रुत्य च जग्राह रुद्रस्य रथकूबरम्॥<br />Thereupon Mahisha was greatly enraged and the quickly advanced towards the chariot of Rudra. Reaching near, he seized its pole with his hands.</p>
<p id='48'>यदा रुद्ररथं क्रुद्धो महिषः सहसा गतः। रेसतू रोदसी गाढं मुमुहुश्च महर्षयः॥<br />When Mahisha in great wrath thus seized the pole of Rudra's chariot, the earth began to groan and the great Rishis fainted away.</p>
<p id='49'>अनदंश्च महाकाया दैत्या जलधरोपमाः। आसीच्च निश्चितं तेषां जितमस्माभिरित्युत॥<br />Huge and cloud-like Daityas made great noise in joy, thinking that they had already won the victory.</p>
<p id='50'>तथाभूते तु भगवान् नावधीन्महिषं रणे। सस्मार च तदा स्कन्दं मृत्यु तस्य दुरात्मनः॥<br />Though the exalted Rudra was in this plight, he did not kill Mahisha, for he knew that the wicked wretch would be killed by Skanda.</p>
<p id='51'>महिषोऽपि रथं दृष्ट्वा रौद्रोरुद्रस्य चानदत्। देवान संत्रासयंश्चापि दैत्यांश्चापि प्रहर्षयन्॥<br />The fiery Mahisha, gloating over the prize he had secured, sent up in great joy loud roars to the great alarm of the celestials and to the great joy of the Danavas.</p>
<p id='52'>ततस्तस्मिन् भये घोरे देवानां समुपस्थिते। आजगाम महासेनः क्रोधात् सूर्य इव ज्वलन्॥<br />When the celestials were in that great danger, Mahasena burning like a (second) sun came forward in great wrath.</p>
<p id='53'>लोहिताम्बरसंवीतो लोहितस्त्रग्विभूषणः। लोहिताश्वो महाबाहुर्हिरण्यकवचः प्रभुः॥<br />That mighty armed lord was clad in red , clothes, adorned with garlands of red flowers and incased in golden armour.</p>
<p id='54'>रथमादित्यसंकाशमास्थितः कनकप्रभम्। तं दृष्ट्वा दैत्यसेना सा व्यद्रवत् सहसा रणे॥<br />He rode on a golden chariot as bright as the sun, drawn by chest-nut horses. Seeing him the Daitya forces suddenly lost heart in the field of battle.</p>
<p id='55'>स चापि तां प्रज्वलितां महिषस्य विदारिणीम्। मुमोच शक्ति राजेन्द्र महासेनो महाबलः॥ सा मुक्ताभ्यहरत् तस्य महिषस्य शिरो महत्। पपात भिन्ने शिरसि महिषस्त्यक्तजीवितः॥<br />O king of kings, the greatly powerful Mahasena hurled a blazing Shakti (weapon) for the destruction of Mahisha. That weapon cut off his head and he fell on the ground dead.</p>
<p id='56'>पतता शिरसा तेन द्वारं षोडशयोजनम्। पर्वताभेन पिहितं तदागम्यं ततोऽभवत्॥ उत्तराः कुरवस्तेन गच्छन्त्यद्य यथासुखम्। क्षिप्ताक्षिप्ता तु सा शक्तिहत्वा शत्रून् सहस्रशः॥ स्कन्दहस्तमनुप्राप्ता दृश्यते देवदानवैः। प्रायः शरैर्विनिहता महासेनेन धीमता॥ शेषा दैत्यगणा घोरा भीतास्त्रस्ता दुरासदैः। स्कन्दपारिषदैर्हत्वा भक्षिताश्च सहस्रशः॥ दानवान् भक्षयन्तस्ते प्रपिबन्तश्च शोणितम्। क्षणान्निनवं सर्वमकार्षु शहर्षिताः॥<br />His head, as massive as a hill, extending in length sixteen yojanas, falling on the ground barred the entrance to the country of the northern Kurus, though now the people of that country easily pass by that gate. It was seen by the Devas and the Danavas that Skanda hurled his Shakti again and again on the field of battle. It returned to his hands again and again killing thousands of the enemies. The fearful Danavas were killed in large numbers by the arrows of the greatly intelligent Mahasena. Then they were exceedingly alarmed and the followers of Skanda began to kill and cut them down and drink their blood. They in great joy exterminated the Danavas in no time.</p>

Your followers have eaten up hundreds of Danavas,</p>
