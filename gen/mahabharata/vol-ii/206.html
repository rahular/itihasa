<h3>None: Chapter 206</h3><h4>The history of a chaste woman</h4><p id='1'>मार्कण्डेय उवाच कश्चिद् द्विजातिप्रवरो वेदाध्यायी तपोधनः। तपस्वी धर्मशीलश्च कौशिको नाम भारत॥<br />Markandeya said : O descendant of the Bharata race, there was a high class Brahmana, known by the name of Kaushika, who was a student of the Vedas and was rich with the wealth of devotion, himself a great devotee and possessed of virtuous behaviour.</p>
<p id='2'>साङ्गोपनिषदो वेदानधीते द्विजसत्तमः। स वृक्षमूले कस्मिंश्चिद् वेदानुच्चारयन् स्थितः॥<br />That foremost of the Brahmanas had finished the study of the Vedas with the Angas and the Upanishadas. On a certain day, he was reciting the Vedas, seated on the root of a tree.</p>
<p id='3'>उपरिष्टाच्च वृक्षस्य बलाका संन्यलीयत। तया पुरीषमुत्सृष्टं ब्राह्मणस्य तदोप॥ि३॥<br />On that occasion there sat on the top of the tree a female crane, which at the time voided excrement on the body of the Brahmana.</p>

<p id='6'>कारुण्यादभिसंतप्तः पर्यशोचत तां द्विजः। अकार्यं कृतवानस्मि रोषरागबलात्कृतः॥<br />Became oppressed with compassion and lamented for her, saying, 'I have committed a crime forced by passion and anger.'</p>

<p id='8'>प्रविष्टस्तत् कुलं यत्र पूर्वं चरितवांस्तु सः। देहीति याचमानोऽसौ तिष्ठेत्युक्तः स्त्रिया ततः॥<br />He, at last entered a house where he used to come before. There he asked by saying-'Give'. Thereupon he was answered by a female, saying, 'wait'.</p>

<p id='10'>भर्ता प्रविष्टः सहसा तस्या भरतसत्तम। सा तु दृष्ट्वा पतिं साध्वी ब्राह्मणं व्यवहाय तम्॥ पाद्यमाचमनीयं वै ददौ भर्तुस्तथाऽऽसनम्। प्रह्वा पर्यचरच्चापि भर्तारमसितेक्षणा॥<br />Her husband, O foreinost of the Bharat race, entered the house all on a sudden. The chaste house-wife, seeing her husband and neglecting that Brahmana, gave to her husband water for rinsing the feet and mouth, as also a seat.</p>
<p id='11'>आहारेणाथ भक्ष्यैश्च भोज्यैः सुमधुरैस्तथा। उच्छिष्टं भाविता भर्तुर्भुङ्क्ते नित्यं युधिष्ठिर॥<br />Then the black-eyed matron served her husband with sweet food and drink and stood by his side, as if to attend to all what he would want. O Yudhishthira, that lady, devoted to her husband, daily ate the remnants of her husband's dish.</p>
<p id='12'>दैवतं च पति मेने भर्तुश्चित्तानुसारिणी। कर्मणा मनसा वाचा नान्यचित्ताभ्यगात् पतिम्॥<br />That lady, always pursuing the thoughts of her husband, regarded the husband, as a celestial; and either in action, thought or speech, she never considered her husband otherwise.</p>
<p id='13'>तं सर्वभावोपगता पतिशुश्रूषणे रता। साध्वाचारा सुचिर्दक्षा कुटुम्बस्य हितैषिणी॥<br />Her thoughts all turned towards her husband; and she was always engaged in serving her lord. She was virtuous and was skillful in good behaviours; and also was ever beneficent to her relatives.</p>
<p id='14'>भर्तुश्चापि हितं यत् तत् सततं सानुवर्तते। देवतातिथिभृत्यानां श्वश्रूश्वशुरयोस्तथा॥ शुश्रूषणपरा नित्यं सततं संयतेन्द्रिया।<br />She was always attentive to what was beneficial to her husband and with her controlled passions she daily attended to the service of the gods, the guests, the mother-inlaw, the father-in-law and the servants.</p>

<p id='16'>वीडिता साभवत् साध्वी तदा भरतसत्तम। भिक्षामादाय विप्राय निर्जगाम यशस्विनी॥<br />Remembering this she was ashamed. Then, O foremost of the Bharata race, that chaste and famous lady went away to give alms to the Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='17'>ब्राह्मण उवाच किमिदं भवति त्वं मां तिष्ठेत्युक्त्वा वराङ्गने। उपरोधं कृतवती न विसर्जितवत्यसि॥<br />The Brahmana said : O the most excellent of women, what was this, that you requested me to wait and that you have not dismissed me?</p>

<p id='21'>इन्द्रोऽप्येषां प्रणमते किं पुनर्मानवो भुवि। अवलिप्ते न जानीषे वृद्धानां न श्रुतं त्वया॥ ब्राह्मणा ह्यग्निसदृशा दहेयुः पृथिवीमपि।<br />Not to mention the men on earth, even Indra bows down to them. O proud one, do you not know or have you not heard from old men that really the Brahmanas are like fire and even can burn the wheel earth.</p>
<p id='22'>स्त्र्युवाच नाहं बलाका विप्रर्षे त्यज क्रोधं तपोधन॥ अनया क्रुद्धया दृष्ट्या क्रुद्धः किं मां करिष्यसि। नावजानाम्यहं विप्रान् देवैस्तुल्यान् मनस्विनः॥<br />The Woman said: O sage-like Brahmana, O you who are possessed of the wealth of asceticism, do not consider that I am the female crane. Wrathful as you are, what will you do to me by this your wrathful look? Really I never disrespect the Brahmanas, who are like the celestials themselves, possessed of great energy.</p>

<p id='26'>बहुप्रभावाः श्रूयन्ते ब्राह्मणानां महात्मनाम्॥ क्रोधः सुविपुलो ब्रह्मन् प्रसादश्च महात्मनाम्। अस्मिंस्त्वतिक्रमे ब्रह्मन् क्षन्तुमर्हसि मेऽनघ॥<br />Thus the superior energy of the high-souled Brahmanas has been heard.

<p id='29'>बलाका हि त्वया दग्धा रोषात् तद् विदितं मया क्रोधः शत्रुः शरीरस्थो मनुष्याणां द्विजोत्तम॥<br />It is known to me that the female crane was consumed by you with your wrath. But, O best of the Brahmanas, the wrath of persons, that resides in their body, is their mortal enemy.</p>
<p id='30'>यः क्रोधमोहौ त्यजति तं देवा ब्राह्मणं विदुः। यो वदेदिह सत्यानि गुरुं संतोषयेत च॥ हिंसितश्च न हिंसेत तं देवा ब्राह्मणं विदुः।<br />The gods know him to be a Brahmana, who forsakes his wrath and spiritual ignorance; and who also speaks the truth here and comforts the preceptor, who having himself injured, never injures others.</p>
