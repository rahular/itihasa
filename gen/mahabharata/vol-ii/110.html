The son of Pandu (Yudhishthira), seeing these various wonderful things, asked Lomasha about those astonishing sights.</p>

<p id='13'>ते दर्शनं त्वनिच्छन्तो देवाः शक्रपुरोगमाः। दुर्ग चक्रुरिमं देशं गिरि प्रत्यूहरूपकम्॥<br />The celestials with Sakra (Indra) at their head did not like to be seen and therefore they made this place inaccessible by raising up hills.</p>

<p id='20'>ततो नन्दाप्लुताङ्गस्त्वं कौशिकीमभियास्यसि। विश्वामित्रेण यत्रोग्रं तपस्तप्तमनुत्तमम्॥<br />Then washing your body in the Nanda, you will go to the Kaushiki where the excellent and severe asceticism was performed by Vishvamitra.</p>
<p id='21'>वैशम्पायन उवाच ततस्तत्र समाप्लुत्य गात्राणि सगणो नृपः। जगाम कौशिकी पुण्यां रम्यां शीतजलां शुभाम्॥<br />O king, washing his there with all his men, he went to the sacred, charming and blessed Kaushiki of cool water,</p>

<p id='28'>किमर्थं च भयाच्छक्रस्तस्य बालस्यधीमतः। अनावृष्ट्यां प्रवृत्तायां ववर्ष बलवृत्रहा।॥<br />Why from the fear of that intelligent boy the destroyer of Bala and Vritra Sakra (Indra) poured down rain when a draught was raging? ।</p>
<p id='29'>कथंरूपा च सा शान्ता राजपुत्री यतव्रता। लोभयामास या चेतो मृगभूतस्य तस्य वै॥ लोमपादश्च राजर्षिर्यदाश्रूयतधार्मिकः। कथं वै विषये तस्य नावर्षत् पाकशासनः॥<br />What sort of a princess that vow-observing Shanta was, who tempted his heart by becoming at nd? Why did not the chastiser of . foes (Indra) pour rain in the kingdom of the royal sage Lomapada when it is heard that he was very virtuous.</p>
<p id='30'>एतन्मे भगवन् सर्वं विस्तरेण यथातथम्। वक्तुमर्हसि शुश्रूषोर्ऋष्यशृङ्गस्य चेष्टितम्॥<br />O exalted one, you should narrate to me all this in detail, the incidents of Rishyashringa's life as they happened.</p>
<p id='31'>लोमश उवाच विभाण्डकस्य विप्रस्तपसा भावितात्मनः। अमोघवीर्यस्य सतः प्रजापतिसमद्युतेः॥ शृणु पुत्रो यथा जात ऋष्यशृङ्गः प्रतापवान्। महार्हस्य महातेजा बालः स्थविरसम्मतः॥<br />Lomasha said: Hear how the powerful Rishyashringa was born as a son of the Brahmana Rishi Vibhandaka whose soul had been subdued by asceticism, whose seed never failed, who was learned and who was as effulgent as the Creator. He (Rishyashringa) was highly honoured, greatly effulgent and was regarded by old men, though he was but a boy.</p>
<p id='32'>महाह्रदं समासाद्य काश्यपस्तपसि स्थितः। दीर्घकालं परिश्रान्त ऋषिः स देवसम्मितः॥<br />Going to the great lake, the son of Kashyapa engaged himself in great austerities. And that celestials-like Rishi became fatigued after a long period of time.</p>
<p id='33'>तस्य रेतः प्रचस्कन्द दृष्ट्वाप्सरसमुर्वशीम्। अप्सूपस्पृशतो राजन् मृगी तच्चापिबत् तदा॥ सह तोयेन तृषिता गर्भिणी चाभवत् ततः। सा पुरोक्ता भगवता ब्रह्मणा लोककर्तृणा॥ देवकन्या मृगी भूत्वा मुनि सूय विमोक्ष्यसे। अमोघत्वाद् विधेश्चैव भावित्वाद् दैवनिर्मितात्॥ तस्यां मृग्यां समभवत् तस्य पुत्रो महानृषिः। ऋष्यशृङ्गस्तपोनित्यो वन एवाभ्यवर्तत॥<br />O king, when he was washing his face, he saw the Apsara Urvashi and his seed fell. A hind drank it up, thirsty as she was, with the water (she had been drinking). She thus conceived. As she was formerly told by the exalted creator of the world, (Brahma), that celestials damsel became a hind and was freed by begetting a Rishi. As the words of the creator could not be false. in that hind was born his (Vibhandaka's) son, a great Rishi, named Rishyashringa, who was always devoted to asceticism and who passed his time in the forest.</p>
<p id='34'>तस्यर्षेः शृङ्गं शिरसि राजन्नासीन्महात्मनः। तेनर्ण्यशृङ्ग इत्येवं तदा स प्रथितोऽभवत्॥<br />O king, on the head of that illustrious Rishi there was a born; he therefore became known as Rishyashringa.</p>
<p id='35'>न तेन दृष्टपूर्वोऽन्यः पितुरन्यत्र मानुषः। तस्मात् तस्य मनो नित्यं ब्रह्मचर्येऽभवन्नृप॥<br />O king, excepting his father, he did not ever see anybody else, therefore his mind was fully devoted to the duties of a continent life (Brahmacharya).</p>
<p id='36'>एतस्मिन्नेव काले तु सखा दशरथस्य लोमपाद इति ख्यातो ह्यङ्गानामीश्वरोऽभवत्॥<br />At this time there was a king of Anga, known by the name of Lomapada, who was the friend of Dasharatha.</p>
<p id='37'>तेन कामात् कृतं मिथ्या बाह्मणस्येति नः श्रुतिः। स ब्राह्मणैः परित्यक्तस्ततो वै जगतः पतिः॥ पुरोहितापचाराच्च तस्य राज्ञो यदृच्छया। न ववर्ष सहस्राक्षास्ततोऽपीड्यन्त वै प्रजाः॥<br />We have heard that he wantonly told a falsehood to a Brahmana. That ruler of earth was therefore abandoned by all the Brahmanas. Thus without having had a priest, the king became sinful and therefore the deity of one thousand eyes (Indra) stopped to shower rain; and thus his subjects began to suffer.</p>
<p id='38'>स ब्राह्मणान् पर्यपृच्छत् तपोयुक्तान् मनीषिणः। प्रवर्षणे सुरेन्द्रस्य समर्थान् पृथिवीपते॥<br />O ruler of earth, he asked the Brahmanas who were intelligent, able and fit how rain might be poured by the lord of the celestials.</p>
<p id='39'>कथं प्रवर्षेत् पर्जन्य उपायः परिदृश्यताम्। तमूचुश्चोदितास्ते तु स्वमतानि मनीषिणः॥<br />(He said), “How can the clouds pour rain, find out a means." Those intelligent men assembling together, gave out each their own opinions.</p>
<p id='40'>तत्र त्वेको मुनिवरस्तं राजानमुवाच ह। कुपितास्तव राजेन्द्र ब्राह्मणा निष्कृतिं चर॥<br />son Thereupon one great Rishi thus spoke to the king, “O king of kings, the Brahmanas are angry with you. Do something to appease them.</p>
<p id='41'>ऋष्यशृङ्गं मुनिसुतमानयस्व च पार्थिव। वानेयमनभिज्ञं च नारीणामार्जवे रतम्॥ स चेदवतरेद् राजन् विषयं ते महातपाः। सद्यः प्रवर्षेत् पर्जन्य इति मे नात्र संशयः॥<br />O king, send for the Rishi's Rishyashringa who knows nothing of the female sex, who dwells in the forest and who takes delight in simplicity. If that great ascetic, O king, come to your kingdom, there is not the least doubt that the clouds will instantly pour rains."</p>
<p id='42'>एतच्छु त्वा वचो राजन् कृत्वा निष्कृतिमात्मनः। स गत्वा पुनरागच्छत् प्रसन्नेषु द्विजातिषु॥<br />O king, having heard these words and resolving to make atonement (for his past misdeeds) he went and came back when the Brahmanas had become appeased.</p>
<p id='43'>राजानमागतं श्रुत्वा प्रतिसंजहषुः प्रजाः। ततोऽङ्गपतिराहूय सचिवान् मन्त्रकोविदान्॥<br />Having heard of the arrival of the being, the subjects became exceedingly glad. Then the ruler of Anga summoned his ministers, proficient in giving counsel.</p>
<p id='44'>ऋष्यशृङ्गागमे यत्नमकरोन्मन्त्रनिश्चये। सोऽध्यगच्छदुपायं तु तैरमात्यैः सहाच्युतः॥<br />He made great efforts to bring Rishyashringa to his kingdom. O undeteriorating one, he at last found out a means in consultation with his ministers.</p>
<p id='45'>शास्त्रज्ञैरलमर्थज्ञैर्नीत्यां च परिनिष्ठितः। ततश्चानाययामास वारमुख्या महीपतिः॥ वेश्याः सर्वत्र निष्णातास्ता उवाच स पार्थिवः। ऋष्यशृङ्गमषेः पुत्रमानयध्वमुपायतः॥<br />Who were all versed in the Shastras, who were all exceedingly proficient in worldly matters and ever able in practical matters. That ruler of earth then brought some courtesans, women of the two, clever in everything. To them the king said, “Find out some means to bring the Rishi's son Rishyashringa.</p>
<p id='46'>लोभयित्वाभिविश्वास्य विषयं मम शोभनाः। ता राजभयभीताश्च शापभीताश्च योषितः॥ अशक्यमूचुस्तत् कार्यं विवर्णा गतचेतसः। तत्र त्वेका जरद्योषा राजानमिदमब्रवीत्॥<br />To my kingdom, O beautiful ones, by tempting him and by securing his confidence. Those women were afraid of the king and afraid as well of (the Rishi's) curse. They becamc pale and confounded; and they said that the business was beyond their power (to accomplish). Thereupon one among them, an old woman thus spoke to the king.</p>
<p id='47'>प्रयतिष्ये महाराज तमानेतुं तपोधनम्। अभिप्रेतांस्तु मे कामांस्त्वमनुज्ञातुमर्हसि॥ ततः शक्ष्याम्यानयितुमृष्यशृङ्गमृषेः सुतम्। तस्याः सर्वमभिप्रेतमन्वजानात् स पार्थिवः॥<br />"O great king, I shall try to bring here that great ascetic. You should however order to procure for me certain things in connection with it. I shall then be able to bring the Rishi's son Rishyashringa here." The king ordered that everything she wanted should be procured.</p>
<p id='48'>धनं च प्रददौ भूरि रत्नानि विविधानि च। ततो रूपेण सम्पन्ना वयसा च महीपते। स्त्रिय आदाय काश्चित् सा जगाम वनमञ्जसा॥<br />He gave her much wealth and various gems and jewels. O ruler of earth, taking with her some young and beautiful women, she then went soon to the forest.</p>
