<h3>TIRTHAYATRA PARVA: Chapter 117</h3><h4>History of Jamadagni</h4><p id='1'>राम उवाच ममापराधात् तैः क्षुदैर्हतस्त्वं तात बालिशैः। कार्तवीर्यस्य दायादैर्वने मृग इवेषुभिः॥<br />Rama said: O father, for my fault you have been killed like a deer in the forest with arrows by those mean and foolish wretches, the sons of Kirtavirya.</p>
<p id='2'>धर्मज्ञस्य कथं तात वर्तमानस्य सत्पथे। मृत्युरेवंविधो युक्तः सर्वभूतेष्वनागसः॥<br />O father, virtuous and ever steady in the honest path as you were, how can fate permit that you should die in this way?</p>
<p id='3'>किं नु तैर्न कृतं पापं यैर्भवास्तपसि स्थितः। अयुध्यमानो वृद्धः सन् हतः शरशतैः शितैः॥<br />What an awful sin must have been committed by them who have with hundreds of arrows killed you who were ever engaged in asceticism, who were old and who were averse to fight with them.</p>
<p id='4'>किं नु ते तत्र वक्ष्यन्ति सचिवेषु सुहृत्सु च। अयुध्यमानं धर्मज्ञमेकं हत्वानपत्रपाः॥<br />How can those shameless men speak of their (shameful) deed to their friends and relatives that they have killed virtuous man who was averse to fight.</p>
<p id='5'>विलप्यैवं सकरुणं बहु नानाविधं नृप। प्रेतकार्याणि सर्वाणि पितुश्चक्रे महातपाः॥ ददाह पितरं चाग्नौ रामः परपुरंजयः। प्रतिजज्ञे वधं चापि सर्वक्षत्रस्य भारत॥<br />Avitavarna Said: O king, thus did he lamentin piteous manner; and then that great ascetic performed all the obsequies of his (deceased) father. That conqueror of hostile cities, Rama, then set fire (to the funeral pyre) of his, father, O descendant of Bharata and then took an oath to destroy all Kshatriyas.</p>
<p id='6'>संक्रुद्धोऽतिबलः संख्ये शस्त्रमादाय वीर्यवान्। जनिवान् कार्तवीर्यस्य सुतानेकोऽन्तकोपमः॥<br />That mighty hero, greatly powerful in battle, equal to god of death himself, then took up weapons in anger; and alone he killed the sons of Kirtavirya.</p>
<p id='7'>तेषां चानुगता ये च क्षत्रियाः क्षत्रियर्षभ। तांश्च सर्वानवामृद्गाद् रामः प्रहरता वरः॥<br />O best of Kshatriyas, that foremost of all wielders of arms, Rama, destroyed all those Kshatriyas who were their followers.</p>
<p id='8'>त्रिःसप्तकृत्वः पृथिवीं कृत्वा निःक्षत्रियां प्रभुः। समन्तपञ्चके पञ्च चकार रुधिरहदान्॥<br />Twenty-one times that lord made the earth Kshatriya-less. With their blood he made five lakes in Samantapanchaka.</p>
<p id='9'>स तेषु तर्पयामास भृगुन् भृगुकुलोद्वहः। साक्षाद् ददर्श चर्चीकं स च रामं न्यवारयत्॥<br />That perpetuator of the Bhrigu race then offered there oblations to his ancestors. Then Rechika appeared to him in a visible form and stopped him.</p>
<p id='10'>ततो यज्ञेन महता जामदग्न्यः प्रतापवान्। तर्पयामास देवेन्द्रमृत्विग्भ्यः प्रददौ महीम्॥<br />Then the mighty son of Jamadagni offered libations to the lord of the celestials in a great sacrifice, in which he bestowed the earth of the Ritvijas.</p>
<p id='11'>वेदी चाप्यददद्वैमी कश्यपाय महात्मने। दशव्यामायतां कृत्वा नवोत्सेधां विशाम्पते॥<br />O king, he built an altar made of gold which was ten vyamas (2O yards) in breadth and nine in height. He made a gift of it to the illustrious Kashyapa.</p>
<p id='12'>तां कश्यपस्यानुमते ब्राह्मणाः खण्डशस्तदा। व्यभजस्ते तदा राजन् प्रख्याताः खाण्डवायनाः॥<br />O king, then at the request of Kashyapa, the Brahmanas divided it into a number of shares and thus they came to be called the Khandavayanas (share-takers).</p>
<p id='13'>स प्रदाय महीं तस्मै कश्यपाय महात्मने। अस्मिन् महेन्द्रे शैलेन्द्रे वसत्यमितविक्रमः॥<br />O king, having bestowed the earth on the illustrious Kashyapa, he engaged in severe austerities on the Mahendra, the foremost of mountains.</p>
<p id='14'>एवं वैरमभूत् तस्य क्षत्रियैर्लोकवासिभिः। पृथिवी चापि विजिता रामेणामिततेजसा॥<br />Thus did hostility arise between him and the Kshatriyas that lived on the earth. The entire world was thus conquered by the imineasurably effulgent Rama.</p>
<p id='15'>वैशम्पायन उवाच ततश्चतुर्दशी रामः समयेन महामनाः। दर्शयामास तान् विप्रान्धर्मराजं च सानुजम्॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Then on the fourteenth day of noon, the high-souled Rama at the proper hour appeared before the Brahinanas and Dharınaraja (Yudhishthira) with his younger brothers.</p>
<p id='16'>स तमानर्च राजेन्द्र भ्रातृभिः सहितः प्रभुः। द्विजानां च परां पूजां चक्रे नृपतिसत्तमः॥<br />O king of kings, that foremost of kings, that lord, then with his brothers offered highest worship to the Brahmanas; and they also worshipped him (Rama).</p>
<p id='17'>अर्चित्वा जामदग्न्यं स पूजितस्तेन चोदितः। महेन्द्र उष्य तां रात्रि प्रययौ दक्षिणामुखः॥<br />Having worshipped the son of Jamadagni and having received due respect from him, he (Yudhishthira) spent a night on the Mahendra (mountain) and he then started towards the south.</p>
