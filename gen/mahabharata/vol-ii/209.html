<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>व्याध उवाच श्रुतिप्रमाणो धर्मोऽयमिति वृद्धानुशासनम्। सूक्ष्मा गतिर्हि धर्मस्य बहुशाखा ह्यनन्तिका॥<br />The Fowler said: It is ordained by the old as found in the Shruti that the ways of virtue are subtle, diverse and infinite.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>प्राणान्तिके विवाहे च वक्तव्यमनृतं भवेत्। अनृतेन भवेत् सत्यं सत्येनैवानृतं भवेत्॥<br />In life being at risk and in marriage, it is proper to speak an untruth. Sometimes by untruth, truth is maintained and by truth untruth is maintained.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>यद् भूतहितमत्यन्तं तत् सत्यमिति धारणा। विपर्ययकृतोऽधर्मः पश्य धर्मस्य सूक्ष्मताम्॥<br />Whatever conduces to the greatest good of all creatures is considered to be the truth. Virtue is thus perverted. Do you mark its subtle ways?</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>यत् करोत्यशुभं कर्म शुभं वा यदि सत्तम। अवश्यं तत् समाप्नोति पुरुषो नात्र संशयः॥ विषमां च दशां प्राप्तो देवान् गर्हति वै भृशम्। आत्मनः कर्मदोषाणि न विजानात्यपण्डितः॥<br />O excellent one, man's actions are either good or bad and he undoubtedly reaps their fruits. The ignorant man, having attained to an object state, grossly abuses the gods, not knowing that it is the result of his own evil Karma.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>मूढो नैकृतिकश्चापि चपलश्च द्विजोत्तम। सुखदुःखविपर्यासान् सदा समुपपद्यते॥<br />O foremost of Brahmanas, the foolish men, designing men and the fickle men attain the very reverse of happiness or misery.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>नैनं प्रज्ञा सुनीतं वा त्रायते नैव पौरुषम्। योऽयमिच्छेद् यथा कामं तं तं कामं स आप्नुयात्।८॥ यदि स्यादपराधीनं पौरुषस्य क्रियाफलम्। संयताश्चापि दक्षाश्च मतिमन्तश्च मानवाः॥<br />Neither learning nor good morals, nor personal exertion can save them. If the fruits of one's exertions were not dependent on any thing else, men would have obtained the object of their desire by their own exertions. Able, intelligent and diligent men.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>दृश्यन्ते निष्फलाः सन्तः प्रहीणाः सर्वकर्मभिः। भूतानामयरः कश्चिद्धिंसायां सततोत्थितः॥ वञ्चनायां च लोकस्य स सुखी जीवते सदा। अचेष्टमपि चासीनं श्री: कंचिदुपतिष्ठति॥<br />Are seen to have been baffled in their efforts; and they attain the fruits of their actions. Persons who are always active in injuring others and in practising deception lead a happy life in this world. There are many who obtain prosperity without any exertion.</p>

The miserly persons with the object of having sons worship the celestials and perform asceticism.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>दशमासधृता गर्भे जायन्ते कुलपांसनाः। अपरे धनधान्यैश्च भोगैश्च पितृसंचितैः॥<br />These sons, remaining for ten months in the womb, (when born) become the stains of their family. Other enjoy luxury, wealth and coins amassed by their ancestors.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>विपुलैरभिजायन्ते लब्धास्तैरेव मङ्गलैः। कर्मजा हि मनुष्याणां रोगा नास्त्यत्र संशयः॥ आधिभिश्चैव बाध्यन्ते व्याधैः क्षुद्रमृगा इव। ते चापि कुशलैवैद्यैर्निपुणैः सम्भृतौषधैः॥ व्याधयो विनिवार्यन्ते मृगा व्याधैरिव द्विज। येषामस्ति च भोक्तव्यं ग्रहणीदोषपीडिताः॥<br />The diseases froin which men suffers are certainly the result of their own Karma. They then behave like small deer in the hands of the hunters. They are afflicted with mental troubles. O Brahmana, as deer are stopped by the hunters, so these diseases are checked by able and skillful physician with their many drugs. Those that have objects of enjoyments suffer from severe bowl complaints.</p>

If there were absolute freedom of action, then no creature would die and none would be subject to decay or await his evil doom. Every body would then attain the object of his desire. All persons try to excel their neighbours; they try to do it with the utmost of their power, but the result becomes the reverse.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>बहवः सम्प्रदृश्यन्ते तुल्यनक्षत्रमङ्गलाः। महच्च फलवैषम्यं दृश्यते कर्मसंधिषु॥<br />Many persons are born under the influence of the same star and the same auspicious good luck, but a great diversity is observed in all their actions.</p>

<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>व्याध उवाच न जीवनाशोऽस्ति हि देहभेदे मिथ्यैतदाहुर्मियते किलेति। जीवस्तु देहान्तरितः प्रयाति दशार्धतैवास्य शरीरभेदः॥<br />The Fowler said : The spirit does not die, in death it simply has a change of abode. They are mistaken who foolishly say that all creatures are to die. The are never soul only goes to another body and its this change of abode is called the Death.</p>

O excellent one, how does it come to belong to a sinful or virtuous man?</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>व्याध उवाच गर्भाधानसमायुक्तं कर्मेदं सम्प्रदृश्यते। समासेन तु ते क्षिप्रं प्रवक्ष्यामि द्विजोत्तम॥ यथा सम्भृतसम्भारः पुनरेव प्रजायते। शुभकृच्छुभयोनीषु पापकृत् पापयोनिषु॥<br />The Fowler said: This mystery belongs to the subject of procreation, but I shall briefly describe it to you.

By a combination of good and bad (actions), it acquires the state of human beings. By indulging in sensuality and similar vicious propensities, it is born as lower animals and by sinful acts it goes to hell.</p>

Man's proper duty consists in his following his own proper avocations such being the case, these avocations never become confused and mixed up.</p>
<p id='38'><a href='#38'></a>प्राज्ञो धर्मेण रमते धर्मं चैवोपजीवति। तस्माद् धर्मादवाप्तेन घनेन द्विजसत्तम॥ तस्यैव सिञ्चते मूलं गुणान् पश्यति तत्र वै। धर्मात्मा भवति ह्येवं चित्तं चास्य प्रसीदति॥<br />The wise man delights in virtue and he lives by virtue.

Of his own free will, he becomes indifferent to all worldly pursuits, but he does not forsake virtue. Observing everything worldly as transcient, he tries to renounce everything and not calculating on mere chance, he devises means for the attainments of salvation. Thus does he renounce all worldly pursuits and shuns all sins.</p>

How might they be subdued? What is the good of subduing them? How does a creature obtain the fruits of doing it? I eagerly desire to kuow all about these matters.</p>
