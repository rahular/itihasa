Thus honoured by a respectful reception, the kings took up their abodes (in the city of Bhima).</p>
<p id='9'>एतस्मिन्नेव काले तु सुराणामृषिसत्तमौ। अटमानौ महात्मानाविन्द्रलोकमितो गतौ॥ नारदः पर्वतश्चैव महाप्राज्ञौ महाव्रतौ। देवराजस्य भवनं विविशाते सुपूजितौ॥<br />At this juncture, those most exalted of the divine sages, the illustrious, greatly wise and austere Narada and Parvata, having arrived at the regions of Indra, obtained admittance into his palace with a respectful reception.</p>

<p id='12'>बृहदश्व उवाच नारदस्य वचः श्रुत्वा पप्रच्छ बलवृत्रहा। धर्मज्ञाः पृथिवीपालास्त्यक्तजीवितयोधिनः॥ शस्त्रेण निधनं काले ये गच्छन्त्यपराङ्मुखाः। अयं लोकोऽक्षयस्तेषां यथैव मम कामधुक्॥ क्व नु ते क्षत्रियाः शूरा न हि पश्यामि तानहम्। आगच्छतो महीपालान् दयितानतिथीन् मम॥ एवमुक्तस्तु शक्रेण नारदः प्रत्यभाषत।<br />Brihadashva said : Hearing the speeches of Narada the slayer of Bala and Vitra, asked, “Where are those warlike Kshatriyas and why do I not find those princes, coming to me, as they are my most favourite guests? They are the virtuous rulers of the earth, renouncing their life in battle. Your meet death by weapons, when time is come; and never turn their faces away from the battle; their is this world, eternal unto them and bestowing upon them all the objects of enjoyments, even as it does to me. Narada, thus addressed by Shakra, said in reply.</p>
<p id='13'>नारद उवाच शृणु मे मघवन् येन न दृश्यन्ते महीक्षितः॥ विदर्भराज्ञो दुहिता दमयन्तीति विश्रुता। रूपेण समतिक्रान्ता पृथिव्यां सर्वयोषितः॥<br />Narada said : O Maghavat, listen to me, why the rulers of the earth are not being seen by you now. The king of the Vidharbhas has a daughter the famous Damayanti; who, in beauty, surpasses all the women of the earth.</p>
<p id='14'>तस्याः स्वयंवरः शक्र भविता न चिरादिव। तत्र गच्छन्ति राजानो राजपुत्राश्च सर्वशः॥<br />O Shakra, her Svayamvara will shortly take place. There the kings and princes are going from all directions.</p>
<p id='15'>तां रत्नभूतां लोकस्य प्रार्थयन्तो महीक्षितः। काक्षन्ति स्म विशेषेण बलवृत्रनिषूदन॥ सर्वे<br />O slayer of Bala and Vitra, the kings, desirous of getting that pearl of the earth, all desire to have her most eagerly.</p>
<p id='16'>एतस्मिन् कथ्यमाने तु लोकपालाश्च साग्निकाः। आजग्मुर्देवराजस्य समीपममरोत्तमाः॥<br />While they were discoursing thus, the most excellent of the immortals, the Lokapalas, (with Agni among them) came before the king of heaven, Indra.</p>
<p id='17'>ततस्ते सुश्रुवुः नारदस्य वचो महत्। श्रुत्वैव चाब्रुवन् हृष्टा गच्छामो वयमप्युत।॥<br />They then all heard the speeches of Narada pregnant with lofty ideas and becoming greatly delighted to hear them said that they would also go there.</p>
