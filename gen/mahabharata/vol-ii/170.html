<h3>None: Chapter 17O</h3><h4>The destruction of the Nivatakavachas.</h4><p id='1'>अर्जुन उवाच ततो निवातकवचाः सर्वे वेगेन भारत। अभ्यद्रवन् मां सहिताः प्रगृहीतायुधा रणे।॥<br />Arjuna said: Then, O Bharata, furnished with arms, all the Nivatakavacha flew in a body towards me furiously in battle,</p>
<p id='2'>आच्छाद्य स्थपन्थानमुत्क्रोशन्तो महारथाः। आवृत्य सर्वतस्ते मां शरवर्षैरवाकिरन्।॥<br />Those mighty car-warriors obstructing the course of the car and uttering loud yells and surrounding me on all sides, enveloped me with downpours of arrows.</p>
<p id='3'>ततोऽपरे महावीर्याः शूलपट्टिशपाणयः। शूलानि च भुशुण्डीश्च मुमुचुर्दानवा मयि॥<br />Then other demons, of great strength armed with spears and Pattishas, hurled at me spears and Bhushundis.</p>
<p id='4'>तच्छूलवर्ष सुमहद् गदाशक्तिसमाकुलम्। अनिशं सृज्यमानं तैरपतन्मद्रथोपरि॥<br />That continuous discharge of spears together with maces and clubs fell upon my car.</p>
<p id='5'>अन्ये मामभ्यधावन्त निवातकवचा युधि। शितशस्त्रायुधा रौद्राः कालरूपाः प्रहारिणः॥<br />Other dreadful and terrible-looking Nivatakavachas, dexterous in hurling (weapons) and armed with sharpened weapons and bows, rushed at me in fight.</p>
<p id='6'>तानहं विविधैर्बाणैर्वेगवद्भिरजिह्मगैः। गाण्डीवमुक्तैरभ्यनमेकैकं दशभिर्मधे॥<br />I (on my part) in the encounter, discharging several fleet arrows coursing straight, from the Gandiva, pierced each of them with ten (shafts).</p>
<p id='7'>ते कृता विमुखाः सर्वे मत्प्रयुक्तैः शिलाशितैः। ततो मातलिना तूर्णं हयास्ते सम्प्रचोदिताः॥<br />(And) I drove them back by those arrows of mine sharpened on stones. Then those horses being swiftly driven by Matali,</p>
<p id='8'>मार्गान् बहुविधांस्तत्र विचेरुर्वातरंहसः। सुसंयता मातलिना प्रामनन्त दितेः सुतान्॥<br />Careered through several courses with the spread of the wind and being dexterously guided by Matali, trampled upon the sons of Diti.</p>
<p id='9'>शतं शतास्ते हरयस्तस्मिन् युक्ता महारथे। शान्ता मातलिना यत्ता व्यचरन्नल्पका इव॥<br />(And) Though that mighty car was yoked with hundreds of horses, yet being skillfully driven by Matali, as they began to move, it seemed as if they were a few only.</p>
<p id='10'>तेषां चरणपातेन स्थनेमिस्वनेन च। मम बाणनिपातैश्च हतास्ते शतशोऽसुराः॥<br />By the press of their hoofs and by the thundering noise of the car-wheels and by the discharge of my arrows hundreds of demons fell dead.</p>
<p id='11'>गतासवस्तथैवान्ये प्रगृहीतशरासनाः। हतसारथयस्तत्र व्यकृष्यन्त तुरंगमैः॥<br />Others, holding their bows in their hands, even when deprived of life and their charioteers being slain, were carried (hither and thither) by the horses.</p>
<p id='12'>ते दिशो विदिशः सर्वे प्रतिरुध्य प्रहारिणः। अभ्यघ्नन् विविधैः शस्त्रैस्ततो मे व्यथितं मनः॥<br />(And) all those dexterous in striking, obstructing all sides and directions, became engaged in the fight with various weapons, at which my mind was distressed.</p>
<p id='13'>ततोऽहं मातलेौर्यमपश्यं परमाद्भुतम्। अश्वांस्तथा वेगवतो यदयत्नादधारयत्॥<br />Then the prowess of Matali appeared highly wonderful to me in that he guided the swift steeds with ease.</p>
<p id='14'>ततोऽहं लघुभिश्चित्रैरस्त्रैस्तानसुरान् रणे। चिच्छेद सायुधान् राजन् शतशोऽथ सहस्रशः॥<br />O king, then, in the fight, I cut off the Danavas by hundreds and thousands who were furnished with arms, by various swift weapons.</p>
<p id='15'>एवं मे चरतस्तत्र सर्वयत्नेन शत्रुहन्। प्रीतिमानभवद् वीरो मातलिः शक्रसारथिः॥<br />O destroyer of foes, the heroic charioteer of Shakra, Matali, seeing me thus course there (on the field of battle) exerting my utmost, became well pleased (with me).</p>
<p id='16'>वध्यमानास्ततस्तैस्तु हयैस्तेन रथेन च। अगमन् प्रक्षयं केचित्र्यवर्तन्त तथा परे॥ स्पर्धमाना इवास्माभिर्निवातकवचा रणे। शरवर्षेः शरार्तं मां महद्भिः प्रत्यवारयन्॥<br />Then, some (of the Danavas) crushed by the horses and the car, met with destruction and some gave up fighting; while others, in the encounter, challenged by us and afflicted with arrows, opposed me by heavy downpour of shafts.</p>
<p id='17'>ततोऽहं लघुभिश्चित्रैर्ब्रह्मास्त्रपरिमन्त्रितैः। व्यधर्म सायकैराशु शतशोऽथ सहस्रशः॥<br />Thereupon, I began to consume them with hundreds and thousands of ornamented swift arrows inspired with Mantras relating to the weapon of Brahma.</p>
<p id='18'>ततः सम्पीडयमानास्ते क्रोधाविष्टा महारथाः। अपीडयन् मां सहिताः शरशूलासिवृष्टिभिः॥<br />Then those mighty demons sore pressed by me and fired with anger, afflicted me with simultaneous discharge of clubs, darts and swords.</p>
<p id='19'>ततोऽहमस्त्रमातिष्ठं परमं तिग्मतैजसम्। दयितं देवराजस्य माधवं नाम भारत॥<br />O Bharata, I then, took up that favourite weapon of the lord of the gods, named, Madhava, possessed of exceedingly fiery energy.</p>
<p id='20'>ततः खङ्गास्त्रिशूलांश्च तोमरांश्च सहस्रशः। अस्त्रवीर्येण शतधा तैर्मुक्तानहमच्छिदम्॥<br />Then by the power of that weapon, I cut, to a hundred pieces, the swords, tridents and thousands of Tomaras hurled by them.</p>
<p id='21'>छित्त्वा प्रहरणान्येषां ततस्तानपि सर्वशः। प्रत्यविध्यमहं रोषाद् दशभिर्दशभिः शरैः॥<br />Having destroyed their weapons, wrathfully pierced each of them with ten arrows.</p>
<p id='22'>गाण्डीवाद्धि तदा संख्ये यथा भ्रमरपक्तयः। निष्पतन्ति महाबाणास्तन्मातलिरपूजयत्॥<br />And the fact that on the battle field mighty arrows like (thick flights of black bees), were discharged from the Gandiva, was admired by Matali.</p>
<p id='23'>तेषामपि तु बाणास्ते तन्मातलिरपूजयत्। अवाकिरन् मां बलवत् तानहं व्यधमं शरैः॥<br />And the skillfulness with which displaying prowess, I cut off, with my shafts, their arrows which completely surrounded me, drew admiration from Matali.</p>
<p id='24'>वध्यमानास्ततस्ते तु निवातकवचाः पुनः। शरवर्षैर्महद्भिर्मां समन्तात् पर्यवारयन्॥<br />Being struck, those Nivatakavachas again completely surrounded me with a mighty discharge of arrows.</p>
<p id='25'>शरवेगानिहत्याहमस्त्रैरस्त्रैविघातिभिः। ज्वलद्भिः परमैः शी।स्तानविध्यं सहस्रशः॥<br />Having arrested the career of their shafts by excellent, fleet and blazing weapons inspired with mantras, capable of destroying (other) weapons, I pierced them by thousands.</p>
<p id='26'>तेषां छिन्नानि गात्राणि विसृजन्ति स्म शोणितम्। प्रावृषीवाभिवृष्टानि शृङ्गाण्यथधराभृताम्॥<br />Like waters running down from the summit of mountains, in the rainy season, blood began to flow from their mangled bodies.</p>
<p id='27'>इन्द्राशनिसमस्पर्शर्वेगवद्भिरजिह्मगैः। मद्बाणैर्वध्यमानास्ते समुद्विग्नाः स्म दानवाः॥<br />Smitten by mighty, fleet and straightcoursing arrows having the touch of the thunderbolt hurled by Indra, those Danavas became greatly agitated.</p>
<p id='28'>शतधा भिन्नदेहास्ते क्षीणप्रहरणौजसः। ततो निवातकवचा मामयुध्यन्त मायया॥<br />Their bodies were cut to a hundred pieces and their weapons lost their energy. Then those Nivatakavachas began fighting with me by the help of illusion.</p>
