<h3>TIRTHAYATRA PARVA: Chapter 144</h3><h4>Entering Gandamadana</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच क्रोशमानं प्रयातेषु पाण्डवेषु महात्मसु। पद्भ्यामनुचिता गन्तुं द्रौपदी समुपाविशत्॥<br />Vaishampayana said: When the illustrious Pandavas had gone only two miles, Draupadi unaccustomed to walk, sat down.</p>
<p id='2'>श्रान्ता दुःखपरीता च वातवर्षेण तेन च। सौकुमार्याच्च पाञ्चाली सम्मुमोह तपस्विनी॥<br />Fatigued and miserable as she was, the Panchala princess became faint on account of the storin and rain.</p>
<p id='3'>सा कम्पमाना मोहेन बाहुभ्यामसितेक्षणा। वृत्ताभ्यामनुरूपाभ्यामूरू समवलम्बत॥<br />Trembling with faintness, the black-eyed lady supported her with her thighs and with her plump and becoming arms.</p>
<p id='4'>आलम्बमाना सहितावूरू गजकरोपमौ। पपात सहसा भूमौ वेपन्ती कदली यथा॥<br />Thus trying to support herself with her thighs which were like the trunk of an elephant, she suddenly fell down on the ground, trembling like a plantain tree stirred (by wind).</p>
<p id='5'>तां पतन्तीं वरारोहां भज्यमानां लतामिव। नकुलः समभिद्रुत्य परिजग्राह वीर्यवान्॥<br />Seeing that foremost of women falling down like a twisted creeper, the greatly strong Nakula ran forward and supported her.</p>
<p id='6'>नकुल उवाच राजन् पञ्चालराजस्य सुतेयमसितेक्षणा। श्रान्ता निपतिता भूमौ तामवेक्षस्व भारत॥<br />Nakula said: O king, O descendant of Bharata, behold, the daughter of the Panchala king, this blackeyed lady has fallen on the ground out of fatigue.</p>
<p id='7'>अदुःखार्हा परं दुःखं प्राप्तेयं मृदुगामिनी। आश्वासय महाराज तामिमां श्रमकर्शिताम्॥<br />O great king, this lady of slow gait, though she does not deserve misery, suffers great afflictions. She is worn out with fatigue. Therefore comfort her.</p>

<p id='9'>तामवेक्ष्य तु कौन्तेयो विवर्णवदनां कृशाम्। अङ्कमानीयधर्मात्मा पर्यदेवयदातुरः॥<br />Seeing her weak and also seeing her pale face, the high-souled son of Kunti, taking her up on his lap, began to lament (in grief).</p>
<p id='10'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच कथं वेश्मसु गुप्तेषु स्वास्तीर्णशयनोचिता। भूमौ निपतिता शेते सुखार्दा वरवर्णिनी॥<br />Yudhishthira said: How can, this beautiful lady accustomed to a life of case (and accustomed) to live in the private rooms and on beds spread over with sheets, sleep on the ground?</p>
<p id='11'>सुकुमारौ कथं पादौ मुखं च कमलप्रभम्। मत्कृतेऽद्य वरार्हायाः श्यामतां समुपागतम्॥<br />The delicate hands and the lotus-like feet of this lady who deserve all excellent things have become dark blue in colour on my account.</p>
<p id='12'>किमिदं द्यूतकामेन मया कृतमबुद्धिना। आदाय कृष्णां चरता वने मृगगणायुते॥<br />Having been addicted to dice what have I done foolishly. I am with Krishna (Draupadi) wandering in the forest full of wild animals!</p>
<p id='13'>सुखं प्राप्स्यसि कल्याणि पाण्डवान् प्राप्य वै पतीन्। इति दुपदराजेन पित्रा दत्ताऽऽयतेक्षणा॥<br />This large-eyed lady was bestowed on us by her father, the king of Drupada, in the hope that this blessed damsel would be happy by obtaining the Pandavas as her husbands.</p>
<p id='14'>तत् सर्वमनवाप्येयं श्रमशोकाध्वकर्शिता। शेते निपतिता भूमौ पापस्य मम कर्मभिः॥<br />Afflicted with hardship, sorrow and travel, it is on account of my wretched act, she (now) lies prostrate on the ground without having obtained any thing hoped for.</p>
<p id='15'>वैशम्पायन उवाच तथा लालप्यमाने तुधर्मराजे युधिष्ठिरे। धौम्यप्रभृतयः सर्वे तत्राजग्मुर्द्विजोत्तमाः॥<br />Vaishampayana said : When Dharmaraja Yudhishthira was thus lamenting, Dhaumya and other foremost of Brahmanas all came there.</p>
<p id='16'>ते समाश्वासयामासुराशीर्भिश्चाप्यपूजयन्। रक्षोघ्नांश्च तथा मन्त्राओपुश्चक्रुश्च ते क्रियाः॥<br />They comforted and consoled him and they honoured him with blessings. They uttered mantras capable of destroying Rakshasas and they also performed (some) religious rites.</p>
<p id='17'>पठ्यमानेषु मन्त्रेषु शान्त्यर्थं परमर्षिभिः। स्पृश्यमाना करैः शीतैः पाण्डवैश्च मुहुर्मुहुः॥<br />On the Mantras being recited by the great Rishis in order to restore her and on the repeated touch of the cool hands of the Pandavas.</p>
<p id='18'>सेव्यमाना च शीतेन जलमिश्रेण वायुना। पाञ्चाली सुखमासाद्य लेभे चेतः शनैः शनैः॥<br />And also on being fanned by the cool breeze surcharged with water, the Panchala princess felt ease and slowly regained her consciousness.</p>
<p id='19'>परिगृह्य च तां दीनां कृष्णामजितनसंस्तरे। पार्था विश्रामयामासुर्लब्धसंज्ञां तपस्विनीम्॥<br />Placing the poor exhausted lady who had then regained her consciousness on a deer-skin, the sons of Pritha made her take rest.</p>
<p id='20'>तस्या यमौ रक्ततलौ पादौ पूजितलक्षणौ। कराभ्यां किणजाताभ्यां शनकैः संववाहतुः॥<br />The twins, taking up her red-soled feet with auspicious marks, began to press them gently with their hands which were scared by the bow-strings.</p>
<p id='21'>पर्याश्वासयदप्येनांधर्मराजो युधिष्ठिरः। उवाच च कुरश्रेष्ठो भीमसेनमिदं वचः॥<br />Dharmaraja Yudhishthira also comforted her. That foremost of the Kurus thus spoke to Bhimasena.</p>
<p id='22'>बहवः पर्वता भीम विषमः हिमदुर्गमाः। तेषु कृष्णा महाबाहो कथं नु विचंरिष्यति॥<br />Yudhishthira said: "O Bhima, many rugged and snowy bound mountains are (before us); O mighty-armed hero, how will Krishna (Draupadi) be able to pass them?</p>
<p id='23'>भीमसेन उवाच त्वां राजन् राजपुत्रीं च यमौ च पुरुषर्षभ। स्वयं नेष्यामि राजेन्द्र मा विषादे मनः कृथाः॥<br />Bhima said: O king, I myself will carry the princess and also these two foremost of men, the twins and yourself; therefore O king of kings, do not allow anxiety to come to your mind.</p>
<p id='24'>हैडिम्बाश्च महावीर्यो विहगो मद्बलोपमः। वहेदनघ सर्वान्नो वचनात् ते घटोत्कचः॥<br />O sinless one, at your command, the son of Hidimba, Ghatotkacha, who can range the skies and who is as strong as myself will carry us all.</p>
<p id='25'>वैशम्पायन उवाच अनुज्ञातोधर्मराज्ञा पुत्रं सस्मार राक्षसम्। घटोत्कचस्तुधर्मात्मा स्मृतमात्रः पितुस्तदा॥<br />Vaishampayana said : Having been ordered by Dharmaraja (Yudhishthira) he remembered his Rakshasa son. As soon as remembered the high-souled Ghatotkacha appeared before his father.</p>
<p id='26'>कृताञ्जलिरुपातिष्ठदभिवाद्याथ पाण्डवान्। ब्राह्मणांश्च महाबाहुः स च तैरभिनन्दितः॥<br />The mighty armed hero, after saluting the Pandavas and the Brahmanas, stood before them with joined hands. They too welcomed him in return.</p>
<p id='27'>उवाच भीमसेनं स पितरं भीमविक्रमम्। स्मृतोऽस्मि भवता शीघ्रं शुश्रूषुरहमागतः॥<br />He then thus spoke to his greatly powerful father Bhimasena, "Having been remembered by you. I have speedily come here to serve you.</p>
<p id='28'>आज्ञापय महाबाहो सर्वं कर्तास्म्यसंशयम्। तच्छ्रुत्वा भीमसेनस्तु राक्षसं परिषस्वजे॥<br />O mighty-armed hero, command me. I shall certainly be able to perform whatever you will order me to do.” Having heard this, Bhimasena embraced the Rakshasa.</p>
