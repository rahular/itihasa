<h3>None: Chapter 215</h3><h4>The colloquy between the Fowler and the Brahmana</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>मार्कण्डेय उवाच गुरुं निवेद्य विप्राय तौ मातापितरावुभौ। पुनरेव स धर्मात्मा व्याधो ब्राह्मणमब्रवीत्॥<br />Markandeya said : Having introduced both of his parents to that Brahmanas as his highest Gurus that virtuousminded fowler again thus spoke to the Brahmana.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>प्रवृत्तचक्षुर्जातोऽस्मि सम्पश्य तपसो बलम्। यदर्थमुक्तोऽसि तया गच्छ त्वं मिथिलामिति॥ पतिशुश्रूषपरया दान्तया सत्यशीलया। मिथिलायां वसेद् व्याधः स ते धर्मान् प्रवक्ष्यति॥<br />The Fowler said: Behold the power of my this virtue by which iny spiritual vision has extended. For this reason you were told by that self-controlled and truthful and chaste lady, 'Go to Mithila, there lives a Fowler who will explain to you the mysteries of religion.'</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>ब्राह्मण उवाच पतिव्रतायाः सत्यायाः शीलाढ्याया यतव्रता संस्मृत्य वाक्यं धर्मज्ञ गुणवानसि मे मतः॥<br />The Brahmana said: O virtuous and vow-observing man, thinking of what that truthful, well-behaved and chaste lady told me, I am of opinion, that you really possess very high qualities.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>व्याध उवाच यत् तदा त्वं द्विजश्रेष्ठ तयोक्तो मां प्रति प्रभो। दृष्टमेव तया सम्यगेकपल्या न संशयः॥<br />The Fowler said: O foremost of Brahmanas, O Lord, what that chaste lady told you about me, was certainly said with full knowledge of the facts.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>त्वदनुग्रहबुद्ध्या तु विप्रेतद् दर्शितं मया। वाक्यं च शृणु मे तात यत् ते वक्ष्ये हितं द्विज॥<br />O sire, I have explained to you all this as a matter of favour. O Brahmana, hear what will be good for you.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>त्वया विनिकृता माता पिता च द्विजसत्तम। अनिसृष्टोऽसि निष्क्रान्तो गृहात् ताभ्यामनिन्दित॥<br />O foremost of Brahmanas, O faultless one, you have wronged your father and mother, for you have left home for learning the Vedas without their permission.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>वेदोच्चारणकार्यार्थमयुक्तं तत् त्वया कृतम्। तव शोकेन वृद्धौ तावन्धीभूतौ तपस्विनौ॥<br />You have not properly acted in this matter, for your ascetic and aged parents have become completely blind from grief at your loss.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>तौ प्रसादयितुं गच्छ मा त्वां धर्मोऽत्यगादयम्। तपस्वी त्वं महात्मा च धर्मे च निरतः सदा॥<br />Go back to please them. May this virtue never forsake you. You are an ascetic, you are high-souled; you are always devoted to your religion,</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>सर्वमेतदपार्थं ते क्षिप्रं तौ सम्प्रसादय। श्रद्दधस्व मम ब्रह्मन् नान्यथा कर्तुमर्हसि। गम्यतामद्य विप्रर्षे श्रेयस्ते कथयाम्यहम्॥<br />But all has become in vain, therefore soon go back to console your parents. Have regard for my words and do not act in any other way. I tell you what is good for you, O Brahmana return even today.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>ब्राह्मण उवाच यदेतदुक्तं भवथा सर्वं सत्यमसंशयम्। प्रीतोऽस्मि तव भद्रं ते धर्माचारगुणान्वित॥<br />The Brahmana said: man of virtuous practices, what you have said is certainly true. Be blessed, I am much pleased with you.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>व्याध उवाच दैवतप्रतिमो हि त्वं यस्त्वं धर्ममनुव्रतः। पुराणं शाश्वतं दिव्यं दुष्प्राप्यमकृतात्मभिः॥ मातापित्रोः सकाशं हि गत्वा त्वं द्विजसत्तम। अतन्द्रितः कुरु क्षिप्रं मातापित्रोर्हि पूजनम्। अतः परमहं धर्मं नान्यं पश्यामि कंचन॥<br />The Fowler said: O foremost of Brahmanas, as you assiduously practise these divine, ancient and eternal virtues which are so difficult to be acquired even by pure-minded men, you seem to be a divine being. Return soon to the side of your parents and be quick and diligent in honouring your father and mother, for I do not know, if there is any virtue higher than this.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>ब्राह्मण उवाच इहाहमागतो दिष्ट्या दिष्ट्या मे सङ्गतं त्वया। ईदृशा दुर्लभा लोके नरा धर्मप्रदर्शकाः॥<br />The Brahmana said: By good luck, I have come here and by good luck I have met with you. Such expounders of religion are difficult to get in this world.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>एको नरसहस्रेषु धर्मविद् विद्यते न वा। प्रीतोऽस्मि तव सत्येन भद्रं ते पुरुषर्षभ॥<br />There is hardly one man amongst one thousand, who is leaned in the mysteries of religion. O foremost of men, I am highly pleased with you. Let prosperity and good fortune be yours.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>पतमानोऽद्य नरके भवतास्मि समुद्धृतः। भवितव्यमथैवं च यद् दृष्टोऽसि मयानघ।॥<br />O sinless one, I was at the point of falling into hell, but I have been saved by you. It was ordained and therefore I did meet you.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>राजा ययातिौहित्रैः पतितस्तारितो यथा। सद्भिः पुरुषशार्दूल तथाहं भवता द्विजः॥<br />O foremost of men, as the fallen king Yayati was saved by his virtuous grandson, so have I now been saved by you.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>मातापितृभ्यां शुश्रूषां करिष्ये वचनात् तव। नाकृतात्मा वेदयति धर्माधर्मविनिश्चयम्॥<br />I shall serve my father and mother at your command. No vicious-minded man can ever expound the mysteries of virtue and vice.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>दुर्जेयः शाश्वतो धर्मः शूद्रयोनौ हि वर्तते। न त्वां शूद्रमहं मन्ये भवितव्यं हि कारणम्॥<br />As it is very difficult for a Shudra to learn the mysteries of eternal religion. I do not consider you to be a Shudra. There must be some reason for all this.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>येन कर्मविशेषेण प्राप्तेयं शूद्रता त्वया। एतदिच्छामि विज्ञातुं तत्त्वेन हि महामते। कामया ब्रूहि मे सर्वं सत्येन प्रयतात्मना॥<br />You must have been born as a Shudra as a result of your past Karma (in a previous birth). O high-souled one, I eagerly desire to learn truth of this matter. Tell this to me with attention and according to your inclination.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>व्याध उवाच अनतिक्रमणीया वै ब्राह्मणा मे द्विजोत्तम। शृणु सर्वमिदं वृत्तं पूर्वदेहे ममानघ॥<br />The Fowler said: O foremost of the Brahmanas, O sinless one, Brahmanas are worthy of all respect from me, hear about the story of my previous existence.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>अहं हि ब्राह्मणः पूर्वमासं द्विजवरात्मजः। वेदाध्यायी सुकुशलो वेदाङ्गानां च पारगः॥<br />O son of the best of Brahmanas, I was a Brahmana previously (in my another birth); I was well-read in the Vedas and earned in the Vedangas.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>आत्मदोषकृतैर्ब्रहान्नवस्थामाप्तवानिमाम्। कश्चिद् राजा मम सखा धनुर्वेदपरायणः॥<br />Through my own fault I have been degraded to my present state. A certain king learned in the science of arms was my friend.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>संसर्गाद् धनुषि श्रेष्ठस्ततोऽहमभवं द्विज) एतस्मिन्नेव काले तु मृगयां निर्गतो नृपः॥<br />O Brahmana, from his companionship, I too became proficient in archery. Once upon a time the king went out hunting,</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>सहितो योधमुख्यैश्च मन्त्रिभिश्च सुसंवृतः। ततोऽभ्यहन् मृगांस्तत्र सुबहूनाश्रमं प्रति॥<br />Surrounded by his ministers and followed by his best warriors. He killed many deer near a hermitage.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>अथ क्षिप्तः शरो घोरो मयापि द्विजसत्तम। ताडितश्च ऋषिस्तेन शरेणानतपर्वणा॥<br />O foremost of Brahmanas, I too shot a swift and fearful arrow. A Rishi was wounded by that arrow with head bent.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>भूमौ निपतितो ब्रह्मन्नुवाच प्रतिनादयन्। नापराध्याम्यहं किंचित् केन पापमिदं कृतम्॥<br />The Brahmana fell down on the ground and screaming aloud said "I have done no wrong, what wretch has done this?</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>मन्वानस्तं मृगं चाहं सम्प्राप्तः सहसा प्रभो। अपश्यं तमृषि विद्धं शरेणानतपर्वणा॥<br />O lord, taking him for a deer I soon went near him and saw that Rishi pierced by my that arrow with head bent.</p>
<p id='27'><a href='#27'></a>अकार्यकरणाच्चापि भृशं मे व्यथितं मनः। तमुचतपसं विप्रं निष्टनन्तं महीतले॥ अजानता कृतमिदं मयेत्यहमथाब्रुवम्। क्षन्तुमर्हसि मे सर्वमिति चोक्तो मया मुनिः॥<br />For my wicked deed I was very much aggrieved in my mind. I said to that Rishi of severe austerities who was loudly crying lying on the ground, “I have unconsciously done this." I again said to that Rishi “you should pardon ine for this sinful act.”</p>
<p id='28'><a href='#28'></a>ततः प्रत्यब्रवीद् वाक्यमृषिर्मा क्रोधमूर्छितः। व्याधस्त्वं भविता क्रूर शूद्रयोनाविति द्विज॥<br />But the Brahmana, becoming exceedingly angry said, “You shall be born as a cruel fowler in the Shudra order."</p>
