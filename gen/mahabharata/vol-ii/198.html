And Markandeya said, "In the horse sacrifice of Ashtaka the descendant of Vishvamitra, all the kings came.</p>

When the sacrifice was over, he was going with his brother on a car when he saw Narada coming. They saluted him and said, “Come with us on this chariot.”</p>

One of them, having gratified the celestial Rishi, the exalted Narada, said, 'All four of are blessed with long life and possess every virtue. We shall therefore go to a certain celestials region and live there for a long time. But who will among us fall down first? The Rishi said "This Ashtaka will fall first."</p>

He one day took me out of the city on his car. I saw there thousands of cows each distinguished by various colour. I asked him whose kine are these. He said, “I myself have made gifts of them.” By these words he flourished his own praise; for this reason he will fall (first). (He said), "we shall then remain, there who among us will fall first?”</p>

Saying as before, he then unyoked the horse on the left (side of the car) and gave it to him. He then went on. But another Brahmana, desiring to get a horse again, came to him. He then gave him the horse yoked to the left front of his car.</p>

He said to the Brahmana, "On my return I shall give (you the horse).” But the Brahmana said, "Give it to me without delay.” He gave the Brahmana the only horse he had. He, then himself seizing the yoke of the car, began to drag it. He said, “There is now nothing (to give) to the Brahmanas."</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>य एष ददाति चासूयति च तेन व्याहतेन तथावतरेत्। अथ द्वाभ्यां यातव्यमिति कोऽवतरेत्॥<br />The king had no doubt given away in charity), but he did it with detraction. For this reason he will fall (first). (He asked), “We shall then remain two, who among us will fall first?"</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>वसुमना अवतरेदित्यब्रवीदृषिः॥<br />The Rishi said, “Vasumana will fall first."</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>किं कारणमित्यपृच्छदधाचष्ट नारदः। अहं परिभ्रमन् वसुमनसो गृहमुपस्थितः॥<br />He asked "For what cause?” Narada said, “Wandering about I came to the house of Vasumana.</p>

When the Brahmanas finished the Svastivachana ceremony, then the car became visible to them.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>तमहं रथं प्राशंसमथ राजाब्रवीद् भगवता रथः प्रशस्तः। एष भगवतो रथ इति॥<br />I praised that car and then the king spoke to me thus, "O exalted one, this car has been praised by you, let this car therefore by yours.”</p>

I went there because I was in need of a car and the king said, “It is yours.” For the third time I went to the king and praised a car. The king exhibited the flowery car to the Brahmanas and looking at me said, “O exalted one, you have enough praised the flowery car." He simply said this but he did not give it to me. For this he will fall down (from heaven).</p>

Narada again said, "Shibi will go, but I shall fall down. "He said "what is its cause?" Narada said-I am not the equal of Shibi. (One day) a Brahmana came to Shibi and spoke to him thus. “O Shibi, I have come to you for food," To him Shibi replied, "What shall I do, command me."</p>

He (Shibi) killed his son and cooking him in the proper way, placed it on a vessel and then taking it on his head he went to search for the Brahmana.</p>

<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>अथ शिबिस्तथैवाविकृतमुखवर्णो नगरं प्रविश्य ब्राह्मणं तमब्रवीत् सिद्धं भगवन्नन्नमिति ब्राह्मणो न किंचिद् व्याजहार विस्मयादधोमुखश्चासीत्॥<br />Shibi heard all this without any change of colour in his face. Entering the city, he thus spoke to the Brahmana, "O exalted one, the food is ready.” Hearing this the Brahmana stood silent. From surprise he stood with down-cast looks.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>ततः प्रासादयद् ब्राह्मणं भगवन् भुज्यतामिति। मुहूर्तादुद्वीक्ष्य शिविमब्रवीत्॥<br />He then gratified the Brahmanas and said "O exalted one, eat." Looking at Shibi for a moment he said.</p>

There is nothing which you cannot give to a Brahmana.” Then the Brahmana worshipped that greatly exalted one.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>स झुद्वीक्षमाणः पुत्रमपश्यदग्रे तिष्ठन्तं देवकुमारमिव पुण्यगन्धान्वितमलङ्कृतं सर्वं तमर्थं विधाय ब्राह्मणोऽन्तरधीयत॥<br />And as he (Shibi) looked in front, he saw his son standing before him like a celestials boy adorned with ornaments and full of fragrance all over his body. The Brahmana having done all this disappeared.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>तस्य राजर्षेर्विधाता तेनैव वेषेण परीक्षार्थमागत इति तस्मिन्नन्तर्हिते अमात्या राजानमुचूः। किं प्रेप्सुना भवता इदमेवं जानता कृतमिति॥<br />It was Vidhata himself who had thus come to try in disguise that royal sage. When he (Vidhata) had disappeared, the ministers thus spoke to the king, “You know everything, why did you then do all this?”</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>शिविरुवाच नैवाहमेतद् यशसे ददानि न चार्थहेतोर्न च भोगतृष्णया। पापैरनासेवित एष मार्ग इत्येवमेतत् सकलं करोमि॥<br />Shibi said: It was not for fame or for wealth or from desire of acquiring any object of enjoyment that I did all this. This path is (never) sinful; it is for this I do all this,</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>सद्भिः सदाध्यासितं तु प्रशस्तं तस्मात् प्रशस्तं श्रयते मतिमें। एतन्महाभाग्यवरं शिबेस्तु तस्मादहं वेद यथावदेतत्॥<br />The path trodden by the virtuous is laudable; my heart is always inclined to such a path. I know this noble example of Shibi's greatness; and therefore I have narrated it to you.</p>
