<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>नानापुष्पफलैर्वृक्षः कृत्रिमैरुपशोभितैः। नानागुल्मलतोपेतैः स्वादुकामफलप्रदैः॥ अतीव रमणीयं तदतीव च मनोहरम्। चक्ने नाव्याश्रमं रम्यमद्भुतोपमदर्शनम्॥<br />She made that floating hermitage charming, extraordinary, magical extremely beautiful, exceedingly delightful, abounding in various plants and creepers, adorned with many artificial trees full of flowers and fruits and capable of giving various delicious fruits.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>ततो निबध्य तां नावमदूरे काश्यपाश्रमात्। चारयामास पुरुषैर्विहारं तस्य वै मुनेः॥<br />Thereupon she moored that boat near the hermitage of Kashyapa's son and the sent men to survey the place which the Rishi generally frequented.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>ततो दुहितरं वेश्यां समाधायेतिकार्यताम्। दृष्ट्वान्तरं काश्यपस्य प्राहिणोद् बुद्धिसम्मताम्॥<br />Then seeing an opportunity and having conceived a plan in her mind, she sent for her daughter, a courtesan, who was exceedingly clever. She then sent her to the son of Kashyapa.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>सा तत्र गत्वा कुशला तपोनित्यस्य संनिधौ। आश्रमं तं समासाद्य ददर्श तमृषेः सुतम्॥<br />That clever woman went near the ascetic arriving at the hermitage she saw the Rishi's son.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>वेश्योवाच कच्चिन्मुने कुशलं तापसानां कच्चिच्च वो मूलफलं प्रभूतम्। स्त्वां वै द्रष्टुं साम्प्रतमागतोऽस्मि॥<br />The Courtesan said : O Rishi, I hope it all well with the ascetics here; I hope fruits and roots are plentiful here; I hope take delight in this hermitage. I have come to pay you a visit.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>कच्चित् तपो वर्धते तापसानां पिता च ते कच्चिदहीनतेजाः। कच्चित् त्वया प्रीयते चैव विप्र कच्चित् स्वाध्यायः क्रियते चर्घ्यशृङ्ग॥<br />I hope the ascetic merits of the ascetics of this place are on the increase; I hope your father (his spirit) has not become less effulgent. O Brahmana, I hope he is pleased with you. O Rishyashringa, I hope you prosecute the studies which are proper to you.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>ऋष्यशृङ्ग उवाच ऋद्ध्या भवाङ्योतिरिव प्रकाशते। मन्ये चाहं त्वामभिवादनीयम्। पाद्यं वै ते सम्प्रदास्यामि कामाद् यथाधर्मं फलमूलानि चैव॥<br />Rishyashringa said : You are shining with luster like the light. I consider you worthy of obeisance. I shall give you water to wash your feet and also fruits and roots as will be liked by you according to my religious ordinance.</p>

<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>लोमश उवाच सा तानि सर्वाणि विवर्जयित्वा भक्ष्याण्यनर्हाणि ददौ ततोऽस्य। तान्युष्यशृङ्गस्य महारसानि भृशं सुरूपाणि रुचिं ददुर्हि॥<br />Lomasha said: Having thrown aside all those (fruits), she gave him food which was not proper to eat. They were exceedingly beautiful and nice and they were very acceptable to Rishyashringa.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>ददौ च माल्यानि सुगन्धवन्ति चित्राणि वासांसि च भानुमन्ति। पेयानि चाचयाणि ततो मुमोद चिक्रीड चैव प्रजहास चैव॥<br />She gave him sweet fragrant garlands and various shining cloths. She then gave him strong drinks, she then played, laughed and enjoyed herself.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>सा कन्दुकेनारमतास्य मूले विभज्यमाना फलिता लतेव। गात्रैच गात्राणि निषेवमाणा समाश्लिषच्चासकृदृष्यशृङ्गम्॥<br />She played before him with a ball like a broken creeper bent with fruits. She touched his body with her own and she again and again clasped Rishyashringa with her arins.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>सर्जानशोकांस्तिलकांश्च वृक्षान् सुपुष्पितानवनाम्यावभज्य। विलज्जमानेव मदाभिभूता प्रलोभयामास सुतं महर्षेः॥<br />She then bent and broke the flowery twigs from trees, such as the Shala, Ashoka and Tilaka; assuming a bashful look, she tempted the Rishis' son who was over-powered with intoxication.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>अथर्घ्यशृङ्गं विकृतं समीक्ष्य पुनः पुनः पीड्य च कायमस्य। अवेक्ष्यमाणा शनकैर्जगाम कृत्वाग्निहोत्रस्य तदापदेशम्॥<br />Having seen Rishyashringa over-powered, she again and again pressed him with her body. Casting glances she slowly went away, as if she was going to make offerings to the holy fire.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>तस्यां गतायां मदनेन मत्तो विचेतनश्चाभवदृष्यशृङ्गः। तामेव भावेन गतेन शून्ये विनिःश्वसन्नार्तरूपो बभूव॥<br />On her departure Rishyashringa became over-powered with desire and became senseless. He became full of her and he felt vacancy. Sighing again and again he seemed to be in great distress.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>ततो मुहूर्ताद्धरिपिङ्गलाक्षः। प्रवेष्टितो रोमभिरानखाग्रात्। स्वाध्यायवान् वृत्तसमाधियुक्तो विभाण्डकः काश्यपः प्रादुरासीत्॥<br />At that moment appeared the son of Kashyapa, Vibhandaka whose eyes were as tawny as those of a lion, whose body was covered with hair down to the nails of his foot, who was engaged in his proper studies and whose life was pure and passed in religious meditations.</p>

He was sighing again and again with upturned eyes. Vibhandaka thus spoke to his distressed son, "O child, why do you not hew logs for the sacrificial fire? I hope you have performed today the Agnihotra (fire sacrifice). I hope you have polished the sacrificial ladles and spoons and brought out the sacrificial cow with her calf, O son, you are not in your wonted state today. You are pensive and absent minded. Why are you so much distressed today? I ask you, who came here today?</p>
