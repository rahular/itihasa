<h3>NALOPAKHAYANA PARVA: Chapter 72</h3><h4>Nala's delivery from Kali</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>बृहदश्व उवाच स नदी: पर्वतांश्चैव वनानि च सरांसि च। अचिरेणातिचक्राम खेचरः खे चरनिव॥<br />Brihadashva said: As the bird course through the sky, so he (king Nala) speedily crossed the rivers, mountains, woods and lakes.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>तथा प्रयाते तु रथे तदा भाङ्गासुरिर्नृपः। उत्तरीयमधोऽपश्यद् भ्रष्टं परपुरजयः॥<br />While the car was thus coursing, the conqueror of hostile towns, the king Vangasura, saw his sheet drop down upon the ground.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>ततः स त्वरमाणस्तु पटे निपतिते तदा। ग्रहीष्यामीति तं राजा नलमाह महामनाः॥ निगृहणेष्व महाबुद्धे हयानेतान् महाजवान्। वार्ष्णेयो यावदेनं मे पटमानयतामिह॥<br />When the garinent had thus dropped down, then the lofty-minded king instantly expressed to Nala his desire to recover it. O you of profound intelligence, do you restrain these horses of great swiftness, until Varshneya bring me back my upper garment here.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>नलस्तं प्रत्युवाचाथ दूरे भ्रष्टः पटस्तवा योजनं समतिक्रान्तो नाहर्तुं शक्यते पुनः॥<br />Thereupon, Nala said to him in reply, “Your garment had dropped down far away; that is, we had advanced about eight miles from that place. It is, therefore, impossible to recover it.”</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>एवमुक्तो नलेनाथ तदा भाङ्गासुरिर्नृपः। आससाद वने राजन् फलवन्तं बिभीतकम्॥<br />O monarch, having been thus addressed by Nala, the royal son of Vangasura came near a tree, called Vibhitaka with fruits, in the wood.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>तं दृष्ट्वा बाहुकं राजा त्वरमाणोऽभ्यभाषत। ममापि सूत पश्य त्वं संख्याने परमं बलम्॥<br />Beholding the tree, the king instantly said to Bahuka: “O charioteer, do you also see my great power of calculation.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>सर्वः सर्वं न जानाति सर्वज्ञो नास्ति कश्चन। नैकत्र परिनिष्ठास्ति ज्ञानस्य पुरुषे क्वचित्॥<br />All men do not know all things; in fact, there is none, who is acquainted with all the branches of knowledge. In one person, the knowledge in its entirety, is not centered.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>वृक्षेऽस्मिन् यानि पर्णानि फलान्यपि च बाहुक। पतितान्यपि यान्यत्र तत्रैकमधिकं शतम्॥ एकपत्राधिकं चात्र फलमेकं च बाहुका पञ्चकोट्योऽथ पत्राणां द्वयोरपि च शाखयोः॥ प्रचिनुगुह्यस्य शाखे द्वे याश्चाप्यन्याः प्रशाखिकाः। आभ्यां फलसहस्रे द्वे पञ्चोनं शतमेव च॥<br />O Bahuka, the leaves and fruits that have fallen from the tree (respectively) exceed the leaves and fruits, that are on the tree itself, by one hundred and one. O Bahuka, these two branches of the tree contain five millions of leaves. Examine the two branches and all their boughs and their fruits will number two thousand and ninety-five."</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>ततो रथमवस्थाप्य राजानं बाहुकोऽब्रवीत्। परोक्षमिव मे राजन् कत्थसे शत्रुकर्शन॥ प्रत्यक्षमेतत् कर्तास्मि शातयित्वा विभीतकम्। अथात्र गणिते राजन् विद्यते न परोक्षता॥ प्रत्यक्षं ते महाराज शातयिष्ये बिभीतकम्। अहं हि नाभिजानामि भवेदेवं न वेति वा॥<br />Thereupon Bahuka stopped the car and addressed the king, “O monarch, O the chastiser of foes, you are saying to me what is beyond my power of perception. O king, I will make this matter perceptible (by my sense) by cutting down the tree Vibhitaka; and when I will really count, there nothing will remain to be supposed. O foremost of kings, I will hew down the tree Vibhitaka in your presence. I do not know whether what you say will really come to pass or not.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>संख्यास्यामि फलान्यस्य पश्यतस्ते जनाधिप। मुहूर्तमपि वार्ष्णेयो रश्मीन् यच्छतु वाजिनाम्॥<br />O ruler of men, I will number the fruits of the tree, while you will see it. Let Varshneya pull up the reins of the horses for a moment."</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>तमब्रवीनृपः सूतं नायं कालो विलम्बितुम्। बाहुकस्त्वब्रवीदेनं परं यत्नं समास्थितः॥ प्रतीक्षस्व मुहूर्तं त्वमथवा त्वरते भवान्। एष याति शिवः पन्था याहि वार्ष्णेयसारथिः॥<br />The monarch asked the charioteer not to lose any time. But Bahuka, with great humility, answered him, saying, "Do you wait for a moment; or, if you are in a hurry, go then with Varshneya, as your charioteer. The way goes smooth and straight."</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>अब्रवीदूतुपर्णस्तु सान्त्वयन् कुरुनन्दन। त्वमेव यन्ता नान्योऽस्ति पृथिव्यामपि बाहुक॥<br />O descendant of the Kuru race, king Rituparna, having comforted Bahuka, addressed him, saying: "O Bahuka, there is none else in this world, who is like you, as a charioteer.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>त्वत्कृते यातुमिच्छामि विदर्भान् हयकोविदा शरणं त्वां प्रपन्नोऽस्मि न विघ्नं कर्तुमर्हसि॥<br />O you versed in the equestrian science, I desire to go to the country of the Vidharbhas with your assistance. May I obtain your protection. It is necessary for you not to cause any obstacle.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>कामं च ते करिष्यामि यन्मां वक्ष्यसि बाहुक। विदर्भान् यदि यात्वाद्य सूर्यं दर्शयितासि मे॥<br />O Bahuka, I shall fulfill your desire, (that is, whatever you will tell me) if you take me today to the country of the Vidharbhas and make me see the sun-rise."</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>अथाब्रवीद् बाहुकस्तं संख्याय मे बिभीतकम्। ततो विदर्भान् यास्यामि कुरुष्वैवं वचो मम॥<br />Thereupon Bahuka answered him, saying: "Having counted the (leaves and fruits of) Vibhitaka tree. I shall go to the country of the Vidharbhas. Act up to my words."</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>अकाम इव तं राजा गणयस्वेत्युवाच ह। एकदेशं च शाखायाः समादिष्टं मयानघ॥ गणयस्वाश्वतत्त्वज्ञ ततस्त्वं प्रीतिमावह। सोऽवतीर्य रथात् तूर्णं शातयामास तं दुमम्॥<br />Surely the king most unwillingly said to him count. (He also said), “O unblameable one, O you versed in the knowledge of horses, having counted (the leaves and fruits of) one portion of this branch, you will be satisfied of the truth of my affirmation." He (Nala) then dismounted from the car with all haste and cut down the tree.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>ततः स विस्मयाविष्टो राजानमिदमब्रवीत्। गणयित्वा यथोक्तानि तावन्त्येव फलानि तु॥<br />Then again he numbered all the fruits; and found out the truth of what the king had said; and, thus struck with astonishment, he addressed the monarch, saying,</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>अत्यद्भुतमिदं राजन् दृष्टवानस्मि ते बलम्। श्रोतुमिच्छामि तां विद्यां ययैतज्ज्ञायते नृप॥ तमुवाच ततो राजा त्वरितो गमने नृप। विद्ध्यक्षहदयज्ञं मां संख्याने च विशारदम्॥<br />"O king, this is most wonderful. I found your high proficiency (in calculation), O monarch, I desire to be informed of your art, by (virtue of) which you have known all this." Thereupon the prince, as he was most desirous to go speedily, said to him this" "Do you know that I am conversant with the play at dice and versed in calculation as well."</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>बाहुकस्तमुवाचाथ देहि विद्यामिमां मम। मत्तोऽपि चाश्चहृदयं गृहाण पुरुषर्षभ॥<br />Then Bahuka said to him" "O foremost of men, do you impart this art to me and take from me my knowledge, regarding the management of horses."</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>ऋतुपर्णस्ततो राजा बाहुकं कार्यगौरवात्। हयज्ञानस्य लोभाच्च तं तथेत्यब्रवीद् वचः॥<br />Thereupon king Rituparna, for the reason of the great importance of his business and also for his extreme desire to acquire the knowledge of horses, agreed to what Bahuka had said.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>यथोक्तं त्वं गृहाणेदमक्षाणां हृदयं परम्। निक्षेपो मेऽश्वहृदयं त्वयि तिष्ठतु बाहुका एवमुक्त्वा ददौ विद्यामृतुपर्णो नलाय वै॥<br />"As you have asked, do you take from me my great skill at dice. O Bahuka, let my knowledge of horses remain with you in trust. Thus saying, king Rituparna gave Nala his knowledge of the play at dice.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>तस्याक्षहृदयज्ञस्य शरीरानि:सृतः कलिः। कर्कोटकविषं तीक्ष्णं मुखात् सततमुद्वमन्॥ कलेस्तस्य तदार्तस्य शापाग्निः स विनिःसृतः। स तेन कर्शिता राजा दीर्घकालमनात्मवान्॥<br />When he (Nala) thus acquired the knowledge of this art of playing at dice Kali came out of his body; while he continued to vomit from his mouth the most virulent poison of Karkotaka. Then that fire of curse (by Damayanti), by which Kali had greatly been afflicted, also came out of his body. In fact, the king, like one of unregenerate soul, had long remained repressed by him (Kali).</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>ततो विषविमुक्तात्मा स्वं रूपमकरोत् कलिः। तं शप्तुमैच्छत् कुपितो निषधाधिपतिर्नलः॥<br />Thereupon Kali, with his soul freed from the poison, assumed his own form. Then Nala, the prince of the Nishadhas, became angry and was intent upon cursing him.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>तमुवाच कलि तो वेपमानः कृताञ्जलिः। कोपं संयच्छ नृपते कीर्तिं दास्यामि ते पराम्॥<br />Kali became frightened; and, trembling with fear, folded his hands; and said to him this: “O king, restrain your anger and, in return, I will impart you great fame.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>इन्द्रसेनस्य जननी कुपिता माशपत् पुरा। यदा त्वया परित्यक्ता ततोऽहं भृशपीडितः॥<br />The mother of Indrasena cursed ine in wrath long ago, that is, at the time when she had been left by you. From that time forward I have greatly been oppressed (by that curse).</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>अवसं त्वयि राजेन्द्र सुदुःखमपराजित। विषेण नागराजस्य दह्यमानो दिवानिशम्॥<br />O foremost of kings, O unconquered one, burning day and night in the poison of the prince of the snakes, I most miserably resided within you.</p>
<p id='27'><a href='#27'></a>शरणं त्वां प्रपन्नोऽस्मि शृणु चेदं वचो मम! ये च त्वां मनुजा लोके कीर्तयिष्यन्त्यतन्द्रिताः। मत्प्रसूतं भयं तेषां न कदाचिद् भविष्यति॥ भयार्तं शरणं यातं यदि मां त्वं न शप्स्यसे। एवमुक्तो नलो राजा न्ययच्छत् कोपमात्मनः॥<br />I place myself under your protection. Do you listen to these my words. Should you not curse me, who am seeking your protection and greatly terrified by you, then the men of this world, attentively repeating your story, will never have any fear on my account.” Having been thus said, king Nala suppressed his own wrath.</p>
<p id='28'><a href='#28'></a>ततो भीतः कलिः क्षिप्रं प्रविवेश बिभीतकम्। कलिस्त्वन्यैस्तदादृश्यः कथयन् नैषधेन वै॥<br />Thereupon Kali became terrified and instantly entered into the three Vibhitaka. While Kali, thus conversing with the king of the Nishadhas, was invisible to others.</p>
<p id='29'><a href='#29'></a>ततो गतज्वरो राजा नैषधः परवीरहा। सम्प्रणष्टे कलौ राजा संख्यायास्य फलान्युत॥ मुदा परमया युक्तस्तेजसाथ परेण वै। रथमारुह्य तेजस्वी प्रययौ जवनैर्हयैः॥<br />Thenceforth the king became freed from all afflictions; and, having numbered the fruits of the tree, he was filled with great joy and was endued with great energy. Then the mighty one mounted on the car; and, urging the swift steeds, proceeded onwards.</p>
<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>बिभीतकश्चाप्रशस्तः संवृत्तः कलिसंश्रयात्। हयोत्तमानुत्पततो द्विजानिव पुनः पुनः॥ नलः संचोदयामास प्रहृष्टेनान्तरात्मना। विदर्भाभिमुखो राजा प्रययौ स महायशाः॥<br />Having been possessed by Kali, the Vibhitaka tree grew worthless. Highly satisfied at the very core of his heart, Nala urged the excellent horses which, like the birds, mounted again and again into the air. Thus the glorious monarch proceeded in the direction of the country of the Vidharbhas.</p>
<p id='31'><a href='#31'></a>नले त समतिक्रान्ते कलिरप्यगमद् गृहम्। ततो गतज्वरो राजा नलोऽभूत् पृथिवीपतिः। विमुक्तः कलिना राजन् रूपमात्रवियोजितः॥<br />When Nala went a long way off, Kali too returned home. Thus prince Nala, having been left by Kali, became delivered from all afflictions. But, O monarch, that ruler of the earth did not regain his native form.</p>
