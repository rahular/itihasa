That adorable and clever Bhadrasakha, with a face like that of a goat, was at the time surrounded by all his sons and daughters whom he guarded carefully in the presence of the great mothers. For this reason the dwellers of earth called Skanda the father of Kumaras. Those who desire to have sons worship the mighty Rudra in the form of the fire-god and Uma in the form of Svaha. By this means they are blessed with sons. The daughters, begotten by Hutasana named Tapa. Having gone to Skanda, were thus addressed by him, 'What can I do for you?'</p>
