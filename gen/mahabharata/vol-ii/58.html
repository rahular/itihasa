<h3>NALOPAKHYANA PARVA: Chapter 58</h3><h4>The colloquy between Kali and the celestials</h4><p id='1'>बृहदश्व उवाच वृते तु नैषधे भैम्या लोकपाला महौजसः। यान्तो ददृशुरायान्तं द्वापरं कलिना सह॥<br />Brihadashva said: After the daughter of Bhima had accepted the king of the Nishadhas as her husband, the protectors of the worlds, of great energy, met, when they were returning, Dvapara accompanied by Kali, approaching towards them.</p>
<p id='2'>अथाब्रवीत् कलिं शक्रः सम्प्रेक्ष्य बलवृत्रहा। द्वापरेण सहायेन कले ब्रूहि क्व यास्यसि॥<br />Shakra, the slayer of Vala and Vritra, beholding Kali, said to him, 'O Kali, tell me, whither are you going with Dvapara as your companion?'</p>
<p id='3'>ततोऽब्रवीत् कलिः शक्रं दमयन्त्याः स्वयंवरम्। गत्वा हि वरयिष्ये तां मनो हि मम तां गतम्॥<br />Thereupon Kali replying to Shakra's words said, 'Hearing the Svayamvara of Damayanti, I am going there. I shall take her to be my wife; for my heart has been captivated by her?'</p>
<p id='4'>तमब्रवीत् प्रहस्येन्द्रो निर्वृत्तः स स्वयंवरः। वृतस्तया नलो राजा पतिरस्मत्समीपतः॥<br />Indra smilingly said to him, “That Svayamvara is now over; king Nala has been accepted by her as her husband even in our presence.</p>
<p id='5'>एवमुक्तस्तु शक्रेण कलिः कोपसमन्वितः। देवानामन्त्र्य तान् सर्वानुवाचेदं वचस्तदा॥<br />Thus spoken to by Shakra, Kali, the viler among the celestials, waxing worth, said to them (celestials) all, the following words:</p>
<p id='6'>देवानां मानुषं मध्ये यत् सा पतिमविन्दत। ततस्तस्या भवेन्न्याय्यं विपुलं दण्डधारणम्॥<br />"In as much as neglecting the divinities she has accepted a man for her husband, it is but severe cquitable that she shall suffer punishment?”</p>
<p id='7'>एवमुक्ते तु कलिना प्रत्यूचुस्ते दिवौकसः। अस्माभिः समनुज्ञाते दमयन्त्या नलो वृतः॥<br />When Kali had spoken in the above manner, the celestials replied, “With our permission, Nala has been chosen by Damayanti.</p>
<p id='8'>का च सर्वगुणोपेतं नाश्रयेत नलं नृपम्। यो वेदधर्मानखिलान् यथावच्चरितव्रतः॥ योऽधीते चतुरो वेदान् सर्वानाख्यानपञ्चमान्। नित्यं तृप्ता गृहे यस्य देवा यज्ञेषुधर्मतः। अहिंसानिरतो यश्च सत्यवादी दृढव्रतः॥ यस्मिन् दाक्ष्यंधृतिर्ज्ञानं तपः शौचं दमः शमः। ध्रुवाणि पुरुषव्याने लोकपालसमे नृपे॥ एवंरूपं नलं यो वै कामयेच्छपितुं कले। आत्मानं स शपेन्मूढो हन्यादात्मानमात्मना॥<br />Also what maiden would not accept Nala as her lord, who is endued with all (excellent) qualities, who is acquainted with all systems of religion, who is a strict observer of vows, who has studied the four Vedas as also the Puranas that are styled the fifth; in whose house the deities are always satisfied by Sacrifices performed in accordance with the rules prescribed for their observance; who never docs any harm to any one, who is truthful and of unshaken vows; in whom truthfulness, forgiveness, knowledge, rigid austerities, purity, self-control and quiescence are ever present; who is the foremost of kings, like the guardians of the worlds. O Kali, that foolish creature, that desires to imprecate Nala of this description, does surely curse his own self and does kill himself by his own agency.</p>
<p id='9'>एवंगुणं नलं यो वै कामयेच्छपितुं कले। कृच्छ्रे स नरके मज्जेदगाधे विपुले ह्रदे। एवमुक्त्वा कलिं देवा द्वापरं च दिवं ययुः॥<br />O Kali, he that wishes to pronounce malediction on Nala of such qualities, sinks into the vast, unfathomable, lake of hell replete with various torments. "Thus speaking to Kali and Dvapara the celestials repaired to heaven.</p>
<p id='10'>ततो गतेषु देवेषु कलिपरमब्रवीत्। संहर्तुं नोत्सहे कोपं नले वत्स्यामि द्वापर॥ भ्रंशयिष्यामि तं राज्यान्न भैम्या सह रंस्यते। त्वमप्यक्षान् समाविश्य साहाय्यं कर्तुमर्हसि॥<br />After the celestials had disappeared, Kali said to Dvapara, 'O Dvapara, I cannot restrain my wrath, I will enter into the Nala and disposes him of his kingdom. He shall not any longer hold any dalliance with the daughter of Bhima. Placing yourself at the dice, you ought to help me.</p>
