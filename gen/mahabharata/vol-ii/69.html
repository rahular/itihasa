<h3>NALOPAKHAYANA PARVA: Chapter 69</h3><h4>Searching for Nala</h4><p id='1'>सुदेव उवाच विदर्भराजोधर्मात्मा भीमो नाम महाद्युतिः। सुतेयं तस्य कल्याणी दमयन्तीति विश्रुता॥<br />Sudeva said: There is a virtuous and illustrious king of the Vidharbhas, named Bhima, whose daughter is this blessed lady, known by the name of Damayanti.</p>
<p id='2'>राजा तु नैषधो नाम वीरसेनसुतो नलः। भार्येयं तस्य कल्याणी पुण्यश्लोकस्यधीमतः॥<br />Also there is the king of the Nishadhas, named Nala, who is the son of Virasena. This blessed damsel is the daughter of that virtuous and intelligent monarch.</p>
<p id='3'>स घृतेन जितो भ्रात्रा हृतराज्यो महीपतिः। दमयन्त्या गतः सार्धं न प्राज्ञायत कस्यचित्॥<br />That ruler of the earth was defeated at dice by his brother; and, thereby deprived of his kingdom, went away with Damayanti without the knowledge of any body.</p>
<p id='4'>ते वयं दमयन्त्यर्थे चरामः पृथिवीमिमाम्। सेयमासादिताः बाला तव पुत्रनिवेशने॥<br />We (the Brahmanas) are roving over the whole world for the sake of Damayanti, which lady is at last discovered in the palace of your son.</p>
<p id='5'>अस्या रूपेण सदृशी मानुषी न हि विद्यते। अस्या ह्येष भ्रवोर्मध्ये सहज: पिप्लुरुत्तमः॥ श्यामाया: पद्मसंकाशो लक्षितोऽन्तर्हितो मया। मलेन संवृतो ह्यस्याश्छन्नोऽभ्रेणेव चन्द्रमाः॥<br />There exists no woman like her in beauty. This maiden of unchanging youth has a beautiful mark, from her birth, resembling a lotus. This freckle was seen by me; but now it has disappeared, owing to its being soiled with dust, even as the moon seems to vanish when covered over with clouds.</p>
<p id='6'>चिह्नभूतो विभूत्यर्थमयंधात्रा विनिर्मितः। प्रतिपत्कलुषस्येन्दोर्लेखा नातिविराजते॥ न चास्य नश्यते रूपं वपुर्मलसमाचितम्। असंस्कृतमभिव्यक्तं भाति काञ्चनसंनिभम्॥ अनेन वपुषा बाला पिप्लुनानेन सूचिता। लक्षितेयं मया देवी निभृतोऽग्निरिवोष्मणा॥<br />That mark of prosperity and wealth, made and given to her by God, is now faintly seen, even as the crescent of the new moon does faintly shine, in the evening of the first day. Although her body is soiled with dust, yet her beauty has not suffered. And again her person, though not washed, is conspicuous and shines like gold. This celestials lady was ascertained by me by my identifying her form as well as that mark (between the eye-brows), even as fire though hid (in ashes) is ascertained by its heat.</p>
<p id='7'>तच्छ्रुत्वा वचनं तस्य सुदेवस्य विशाम्पते। सुनन्दा शोधयामास पिप्लुप्रच्छादनं मलम्॥<br />O monarch! Sunanda, having heard the words of Sudeva, cleaned the dust that soiled ile freckle (between the eye-brows of Damayanti).</p>
<p id='8'>स मलेनापकृष्टेन पिप्लुस्तस्या व्यरोचत। दमयन्त्या यथा व्यभ्रे नभसीव निशाकरः॥<br />The mole of Damayanti, having been cleared of the bad dust, became conspicuous like the moon, which appears in the sky when the clouds are dispersed.</p>
<p id='9'>पिप्लुं दृष्ट्वा सुनन्दा च राजमाता च भारत। रुदत्यौ तां परिष्वज्य मुहूर्तमिव तस्थतुः॥<br />O Bharata! seeing that mark, Sunanda as well as the mother of the king, wept; and, embracing her, stood there for some time.</p>
<p id='10'>उत्सृज्य बाष्पं शनकै राजमातेदमब्रवीत्। भगिन्या दुहिता मेऽसि पिप्लुनानेन सूचिता॥<br />Shedding tcars and in a low voice, the Queen-mother said, 'Know by this your mole, you are the daughter of my sister.</p>
<p id='11'>अहं च तव माता च राज्ञस्तस्य महात्मनः। सुते दशार्णाधिपतेः सुदाम्नश्चारुदर्शने॥<br />O handsome looking one! myself and your mother are the daughters of that illustrious king, Sudaman, who is the ruler of the Dasharnas.</p>
<p id='12'>भीमस्य राज्ञः सा दत्ता वीरबाहोरहं पुनः। त्वं जाता मया दृष्टा दशार्णेषु पितुहे॥<br />She was given to king Bhima and myself was given to Virabahu. I saw you were born at our father's palace in the country of the Dasharmas.</p>
<p id='13'>यथैव ते पितुर्गेहं तथैव मम भामिनि। यथैव च ममैश्वर्यं दमयन्ति तथा तव॥<br />O beauteous lady! as is your father's house, so is mine, to you. O Damayanti! my wealth is to you, cven as your own.</p>
<p id='14'>तां प्रहप्टेन मनसा दमयन्ती विशाम्पते। प्रणम्य मातुर्भगिनीमिदं वचनमब्रवीत्॥<br />O monarch! thereupon Damayanti, having bowed down unto her with a delightful heart,</p>
<p id='15'>अज्ञायमानापि सती सुखमसम्युषिता त्वयि। सर्वकामैः सुविहिता रक्ष्यमाणा सदा त्वया॥ तु<br />“Although I stayed here unrecognised, still I lived with your happily and supplied with all the objects of my desire and ever protected by you.</p>
<p id='16'>सुखात् सुखतरो वासो भविष्यति न संशयः। चिरविप्रोषितां मातामनुज्ञातुमर्हसि॥<br />Undoubtedly I shall have a happier abode than this. Therefore, O mother, grant permission unto me, who am ever living in exile.</p>
<p id='17'>दारकौ च हि मे नीतौ वसतस्तत्र बालकौ। पित्रा विहीनौ शोकातॊ मया चैव कथं नु तौ॥<br />My children, the son and daughter, were led to my father's palace, where they are living now, hard pressed with sorrow on account of their separation from their father and mother.</p>
<p id='18'>यदि चापि प्रियं किंचिन्मयि कर्तुमिहेच्छसि। विदर्भान् यातुमिच्छामि शीघ्रं मे यानमादिश॥ बाढमित्येव तामुक्त्वा हृष्टा मातृष्वसा नृप। गुप्तां बलेन महता पुत्रस्यानुमते ततः॥ प्रास्थापयद् राजमाता श्रीमती नरवाहिना। यानेन भरतश्रेष्ठ स्वन्नपानपरिच्छदाम्॥<br />Should you wish to do me some good order at once a vehicle; for I am desirous to go to the country of the Vidharbhas.” Thereupon, O monarch, saying, “So be it,” the sister of Damayanti's mother, the queen-mother highly satisfied and with the permission of her son, sent away Damayanti in a beautiful vehicle conveyed by men and guarded by a strong force, as also the lady, O the foremost of the descendants of Bharata, was provided with tasteful food and drink and valuable dresses.</p>
<p id='19'>ततः सा न चिरादेव विदर्भानगमत् पुनः। तु बन्धुजनः सर्वः प्रहृष्टः समपूजयत्॥<br />Then the lady immediately went away to the country of the Vidharbhas, where all her friends and relatives, satisfied with her arrival, offered praises to her.</p>
<p id='20'>सर्वान् कुशलिनो दृष्ट्वा बान्धवान् दारकौ च तौ मातरं पितरं चोभौ सर्वं चैव सखीजनम्॥ देवताः पूजयामास ब्राह्मणांश्च यशस्विनी। परेण विधिना देवी दमयन्ती विशाम्यते॥<br />O king, beholding that her relatives, her son and daughter, father and mother and all her companions were at peace, the goddess-like and all-glorious Damayanti worshipped the gods and the Brahmanas in the best way.</p>
<p id='21'>अतर्पयत् सुदेवं च गोसहस्रेण पार्थिवः। प्रीतो दृष्ट्वैव तनयां ग्रामेण द्रविणेन च॥<br />The king, beholding his daughter, became gratified and presented to Sudeva a thousand kine, immense fortune and a village.</p>
<p id='22'>सा व्युष्टा रजनीं तत्र पितुर्वेश्मनि भाविनी। विश्रान्ता मातरं राजन्निदं वचनमब्रवीत्॥<br />O monarch! the handsome lady having spent there the whole night at her father's palace and taken perfect rest, addressed her mother thus:</p>
<p id='23'>दमयन्त्युवाच मां चेदिच्छसि जीवन्ती मातः सत्यं ब्रवीमि ते। नलस्य नरवीरस्य यतस्वानयने पुनः॥<br />Damayanti said : O mother! should you desire me to live, I tell the truth, take care to bring here that hero among men, viz., Nala.</p>
<p id='24'>दमयन्त्या तथोक्ता सा देवी भृशदुःखिता। बाष्पेणापिहिता राज्ञी नोत्तरं किंचिदब्रवीत्॥<br />Thus addressed by Damayanti,"the goddesslike queen became greatly afflicted with grief and was suffused with tears and spoke nothing to her in reply.</p>
<p id='25'>तदवस्थां तु तां दृष्ट्वा सर्वमन्तःपुरं तदा। हाहाभूतमतीवासीद् भृशं च प्ररुरोद ह॥<br />Thereupon all the inmates of the king's harem uttered the exclamations of 'Oh'! and 'Alas'! at this dangerous situation of Damayanti and also wept most bitterly.</p>
<p id='26'>ततो भीमं महाराजं भार्या वचनमब्रवीत्। दमयन्ती तव सुता भर्तारमनुशोचति॥<br />Then the queen spoke to the illustrious king, Bhima, thus: 'Your daughter, Damayanti, is lamenting, for her husband.</p>
<p id='27'>अपकृष्य च लज्जां सा स्वयमुक्तवती नृप। प्रयतन्तां तव प्रेष्याः पुण्यश्लोकस्य मार्गणे॥<br />O monarch! unblushed with shame, Damayanti herself said that my men should try to find out the whereabouts of that virtuous king (Nala).</p>
<p id='28'>तया प्रदेशितो राजा ब्राह्मणान् वशवर्तिनः। प्रास्थापयद् दिशः सर्वा यतध्वं नलमार्गणे॥<br />Thus urged by the queen, the king sent out the dependant Brahmanas in all directions; and enjoined them to strive to find out the whereabouts of king Nala.</p>
<p id='29'>ततो विदर्भाधियतेर्नियोगाद् ब्राह्मणास्तदा। दमयन्तीमथो सृत्वा प्रस्थिता:स्मेत्यथाब्रुवन्।॥<br />Thereupon, at the injunction of the king of the Vidharbhas, all the Brahmanas approached Damayanti and told her that they were going away (for searching Nala).</p>
<p id='30'>अथ तानब्रवीद् भैमी सर्वराष्ट्रेष्विदं वचः। ब्रुवध्वं जनसंसत्सु तत्र तत्र पुनः पुनः॥<br />Then the daughter of Bhima asked them to repeat, in all countries and before all crowds of men, these words.</p>
<p id='31'>क्व नु त्वं कितवच्छित्त्वा वस्त्रार्धं प्रस्थितो मम। उत्सृज्य विपिने सुप्तामनुरक्तां प्रियां प्रिय॥<br />'O gambler, O beloved one, did you tear off a half of my cloth and flee away forsaking your dear and devoted wife sleeping in the forest?</p>
<p id='32'>सा वै यथा त्वया दृष्टा तथाऽऽस्ते त्वत्प्रतीक्षिणा दह्यमाना भृशं वाला वस्त्रार्थेनाभिसंवृता॥<br />'Indeed, in obedience to your command that lady, covered in half a piece of cloth and greatly burning with woe, is ever expecting you.</p>
<p id='33'>तस्या रुदत्याः सततं तेन शोकेन पार्थिव। प्रसादं कुरु वै वीर प्रतिवाक्यं ददस्व च॥<br />'O monarch, O mighty one, do you answer; and do you show favour to her, who is ever weeping on account of that woe.'</p>
<p id='34'>एवमन्यच्च वक्तव्यं कृपां कुर्याद् यथा मयि) वायुनाधूयमानो हि वनं दहति पावकः॥<br />Do you cry, saying this and the like, viz., fire (here compared with grief of Damayanti), led by the wind (compared with time), consumes the forest (compared with the body of Damayanti); and then the lord will pity me.</p>
<p id='35'>भर्तव्या रक्षणीया च पत्नी पत्या हि सर्वदा। तन्नष्टमुभयं कस्माद्धर्मज्ञस्य सतस्तव॥<br />Further do you cry, saying: "The wife is always to be maintained and protected by the husband. You are righteous and honest as well. Why, therefore, these virtues of yours are being neglected by you.</p>
<p id='36'>ख्यातः प्राज्ञः कुलीनश्च सानुक्रोशो भवान् सदा। संवृत्तो निरनुक्रोशः शङ्के मद्भाग्यसंक्षयात्॥<br />You are well reputed, wise, respectable and always kind. But why now have you become unkind; and that is perhaps for the reason of my adverse fortune.</p>
<p id='37'>तत् कुरुष्व नरव्याघ्र दयां मयि नरर्षभ। आनृशंस्यं परोधर्मस्त्वत्त एव हि मे श्रुतः॥<br />O foremost of men, O the most excellent of persons, be you kind to me. For I have heard from you, that kindness is the chief virtue.”</p>
<p id='38'>एवं ब्रुवाणान् यदि वः प्रतिब्रूयात् कथंचन। स नरः सर्वथा ज्ञेयः कश्चासौ क्व नु वर्तते॥<br />If anybody answer you, as you would speak in this way, that man should be known by you in every way; and also it should be learnt what is he and where does he live.</p>
<p id='39'>यश्चैवं वचनं श्रुत्वा ब्रूयात् प्रतिवचो नरः। तदादाय वचस्तस्य ममावेद्यं द्विजोत्तमाः॥<br />O excellent of the regenerate ones! do you convey to me the words of that man who, hearing these words of yours, will answer you.</p>
<p id='40'>यथा च वो न जानीयाद् ब्रुवतो मम शासनात्। पुनरागमनं चैव तथा कार्यमतन्द्रितैः॥<br />Do you take care that no body should know that these words are uttered by you at my behest; neither do you do such to return to me.</p>
<p id='41'>यदि वासौ समृद्धः स्याद् यदि वाप्यधनो भवेत्। यदि वाप्यसमर्थः स्याज्ज्ञेयमस्य चिकीर्षितम्॥<br />You should know whether the man is rich or poor or powerless; and know also his desires.</p>
<p id='42'>एवमुक्तास्त्वगच्छंस्ते ब्राह्मणाः सर्वतो दिशम्। ते पुराणि नलं मृगयितुं राजंस्तदा व्यसनिनं तथा॥ सराष्ट्राणि ग्रामान् घोषांस्तथाऽऽश्रमान्। अन्वेषन्तो नलं राजन् नाधिजग्मुर्द्विजातयः॥<br />O king, thus advised, the Brahmanas departed in all directions in order to search for Nala, who had fallen into such great calamity. O monarch, the regenerate ones wandered in the cities, kingdoms, villages, the dwellings of the cowherds and the retreats of he sages in search of king Nala.</p>
<p id='43'>तच्च वाक्यं तथा सर्वे तत्र तत्र विशाम्यते। श्रावयांचक्रिरे विप्रा दमयन्त्या यथेरितम्॥<br />O ruler of the earth, all the Brahmanas repeated the words, wherever they wandered, which Damayanti had enjoined them to do.</p>
