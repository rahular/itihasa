<p id='24'>एतच्छ्रुत्वा नमस्तस्मै कृत्वासौ सह कन्यया। तत्राभ्यगच्छद् देवेन्द्रो यत्र देवर्षयोऽभवन्॥ वसिष्ठप्रमुखा मुख्या विप्रेन्द्राः सुमहाबलाः।<br />Having heard this, Indra, with that damsel bowed to him; and then he went to the place where those great Brahmanas, the mighty celestials Rishis, Mahatmans and other lived.</p>
<p id='25'>भागार्थं तपसो धातुं तेषां सोमं तथाध्वरे॥ पिपासवो ययुर्देवा: शतक्रतुपुरोगमाः।<br />With Indra at their head, the celestials with the desire of drinking the Soma to receive their respective shares, went to the sacrifices of those Rishis.</p>
<p id='26'>इष्टि कृत्वा यथान्यायं सुसमिद्धे हुताशने॥ जुहुवुस्ते महात्मानो हव्यं सर्वदिवौकसाम्।<br />Having duly performed the ceremony with the blazing fire, those high-souled men offered oblation to the dwellers of heaven.</p>
<p id='27'>समाहूतो हुतवहः सोऽद्भुतः सूर्यमण्डलात्॥ विनिःसृत्य ययौ वह्निर्वाग्यतो विधिवत् प्रभुः। आगम्याहवनीयं वै तैर्द्विजैर्मन्त्रतो हुतम्॥ स तत्र विविधं हव्यं प्रतिगृह्य हुताशनः। ऋषिभ्यो भरतश्रेष्ठ प्रायच्छत दिवौकसाम्॥<br />The Adbhuta fire, that carrier of oblations, was invoked with mantras. Coming out of the disc of the sun, that exalted fire restrained his speech and went there. O best of the Bharata race, entering the sacrificial fire that had been made and into which various offerings were made by the Rishis with mantras, the fire took them with him and made them over to the dwellers of heaven.</p>
<p id='28'>निष्क्रामंश्चाप्यपश्यत् स पत्नीस्तेषां महात्मनाम्। स्वेष्वासनेषूपविष्टाः स्वपन्तीश्च तथा सुखम्॥<br />Coming out from that place, he saw the wives of those high-souled Rishis sleeping comfortably on their respective beds,</p>
<p id='29'>रुक्मवेदिनिभास्तास्तु चन्द्रलेखा इवामलाः। हुताशनार्चिप्रतिमाः सर्वास्तारा इवाद्भुताः॥<br />Their complexion was like that of an alter of gold. It was spotless like the disc of moon. It was scattering the beam of light like flames and their bauty was like that of galaxy in the sky.</p>
<p id='30'>स तत्र तेन मनसा बभूव क्षुभितेन्द्रियः। पत्नीदृष्ट्वा द्विजेन्द्राणां वह्निः कामवशं ययौ।॥<br />Seeing the wives of those foremost of Brahmanas with eager eyes, his mind became greatly agitated; he was filled with desires.</p>
<p id='31'>भूयः संचिन्तयामास न न्याय्यं क्षुभितो ह्यहम्। साध्व्यः पत्न्यो द्विजेन्द्राणामकामाः कामयाम्यहम्॥ नैताः शक्या मया द्रष्टुं स्प्रष्टुं वाप्यनिमित्ततः। गार्हपत्यं समाविश्य तस्मात् पश्याम्यभीक्ष्णशः॥<br />Restraining his heart, he considered to be very improper it to be thus moved (will desire). He thought, “The wives of these illustrated Brahınanas are chaste and faithful. They are beyond the reach of other people's desires. I am filled with desire to possess them. I shall therefore by becoming their household fire gratify myself with daily looking at them.”</p>
<p id='32'>मार्कण्डेय उवाच संस्पृशन्निव सर्वास्ताः शिखाभिः काञ्चनप्रभाः। पश्यमानश्च मुमुदे गार्हपत्यं समाश्रितः॥<br />Thus transforming himself into a household fire Adbhuta fire was highly gratified with seeing those gold complexioned ladies and touching them with his flames.</p>
<p id='33'>निरुष्य तत्र सुचिरमेवं वह्रिर्वशं गतः। मनस्तासु विनिक्षिप्य कामयानो वराङ्गनाः॥<br />Attracted by their beauty, he lived there for a long time. Being filled with great love for them, he gave them his heart.</p>
<p id='34'>कामसंतप्तहदयो देहत्यागविनिश्चितः। अलाभे ब्राह्मणस्त्रीणामग्निर्वनमुपागमत्॥<br />Being disappointed to win the hearts of those Brahmana women and being much afflicted by love, he went to a forest to commit suicide.</p>
<p id='35'>स्वाहा तं दक्षदुहिता प्रथमं कामयत् तदा। सा तस्य छिद्रमन्वैच्छच्चिरात्प्रभृति भाविनी॥<br />But a little while ago, Svaha, the daughter of Daksha, had bestowed her heart on him. That lady was seeking to detect his weak moments.</p>
<p id='36'>अप्रमत्तस्य देवस्य न च पश्यत्यनिन्दिता। सा तं ज्ञात्वा यथावत् तु वह्नि वनमुपागतम्॥ तत्त्वतः कामसंतप्तं चिन्तयामास भाविनी। अहं सप्तर्षिपत्नीनां कृत्वा रूपाणि पावकम्॥ कामयिष्यामि कामार्ता तासां रूपेण मोहितम्। एवं कृते प्रीतिरस्य कामावाप्तिश्च मे भवेत्॥<br />That faultless lady did not succeed in finding out any weakness in that cool and collected deity of fire. But now that the fire-deity had gone to the forest afflicted with the pangs of love; she thought thus, "As I am too much afflicted with love, I shall assume the disguise of the wives of the seven Rishis and in that disguise I shall find out the deity of fire who is so much smitten with their charms. He will be then gratified and my desire also will be satisfied.</p>
