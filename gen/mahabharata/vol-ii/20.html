O best of men, surrounded by my invincible and victorious army consisting of four kinds of troops, all so persevering in battle, I started.</p>

<p id='33'>ततस्तदस्त्रं कौन्तेयधूतं तूलमिवानलैः। तथा तदभवद् युद्धं तुमुलं लोमहर्षणम्। लब्धालोकस्तु राजेन्द्र पुनः शत्रुमयोधयम्॥<br />O son of Kunti, that weapon rushed onwards like flakes of cotton blown away by the winds. Tlien a great and hair-stirring battle took place. O king of kings, having rcguined light, I again fought with the enemy.</p>
