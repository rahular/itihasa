It is the root of niggardliness, boastfulness, pride, fear and anxiety. These are the miseries that wise men see in wealth. Men have to suffer infinite miseries in the acquisition and retention of wealth. Its expenditure also is painful. Sometimes men are even killed for the sake of wealth. To abandon wealth is painful; even those men who are cherished become enemies for the sake of wealth.</p>
<p id='37'><a href='#37'></a>दुःखेन चाधिगम्यन्ते तस्मान्नाशं न चिन्तयेत्। असंतोषपरा मूढाः संतोषं यान्ति पण्डिताः॥<br />As the possession of wealth is fraught with such misery, one should not (at all) mind its loss. Ignorant men alone are discontented, but the wise men are always contented.</p>

The man of wealth can never be without dangers. For this reason virtuous men praise those who have no desire for wealth.</p>
<p id='41'><a href='#41'></a>धर्मार्थं यस्य वित्तेहा वरं तस्य निरीहता। प्रक्षालनाद्धि पंकस्य श्रेयो न स्पर्शनं नृणाम्॥<br />As regards those that acquire wealth for the virtuous purposes, it is better for them not to do it at all. It is better not to touch mud than to wash it off after being besmeared with it.</p>
