<p id='13'>पुष्पवर्षं च सुमहन्निपपात महीतले। मेघजालं च विततं छादयामास सर्वतः॥ सोऽतीत्य वनदुर्गाणि संनिकर्षे महागिरेः। शुशुभे हिमवत्पृष्ठे वसमानोऽर्जुनस्तदा॥<br />Great showers of flowers fell on the earth; and the clouds spreading out covered every place with a shade.

<p id='22'>ततो महर्षयः सर्वे जग्मुर्देवं पिनाकिनम्। निवेदयिषवः पार्थं तपस्युचे समास्थितम्॥<br />Thereupon all the great Rishis went to the god, the wielder of trident (Shiva) and told him that the son of Pritha (Arjuna) was engaged in austere asceticism.</p>
<p id='23'>तं प्रणम्य महादेवं शशंसुः पार्थकर्म तत्। एष पार्थो महातेजा हिमवत्पृष्ठमास्थितः॥ उग्रे तपसि दुष्पारे स्थितोधूमाययन् दिशः। तस्य देवेश न वयं विद्मः सर्वे चिकीर्षितम्॥<br />Bowing to the great god (Shiva), they told him all about the action of Partha. (They said), “The greatly effulgent Partha is engaged in austere asceticism on the breast of the Himalayas. Heated with his asceticism the earth is sending forth smokes. O chief of gods, we do not know with what object he undergoes this asceticism.</p>
<p id='24'>संतापयति नः सर्वानसौ साधु निवार्यताम्। तेषां तद्वचनं श्रुत्वा मुनीनां भावितात्मनाम्॥ उमापतिर्भूतपतिर्वाक्यमेतदुवाच ह।<br />He causes us pain. O exalted one, you ought to stop him." Having heard these words of those self-controlled Rishis. The husband of Uma, the lord of creatures, thus spoke.</p>
<p id='25'>महादेव उवाच न वो विषादः कर्तव्यः फाल्गुनं प्रति सर्वशः॥ शीघ्रं गच्छत संहृष्टा यथागतमतन्द्रिताः। अहमस्य विजानामि संकल्पं मनसि स्थितम्॥<br />Shiva said : You all ought not feel any anxiety on account of Falguni (Arjuna). Go away soon with cheerfulness and alacrity to the place whence you have come. I know what is the determination of his mind.</p>
