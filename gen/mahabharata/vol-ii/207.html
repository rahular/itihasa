<p id='2'>चिन्तयानः स्वधर्मस्य सूक्ष्मां गतिमथाब्रवीत्। श्रद्दधानेन वै भाव्यं गच्छामि मिथिलामहम्॥<br />Thus meditating upon the fine way of virtue, he said, I should, indeed, respectfully agree to her speech; and, therefore, go at once to Mithila.</p>
<p id='3'>कृतात्मा धर्मवित् तस्यां व्याधो निवसते किला तं गच्छाम्यहमद्यैव धर्मं प्रष्टुं तपोधनम्॥<br />Surely there lives in that city a fowler, who possess a soul under complete control and who also is thoroughly versed in the principles of morality. This day I will go to him, who possesses wealth of asceticism in order to ask him about the principles of morality.</p>
<p id='4'>इति संचित्य मनसा श्रद्दधानः स्त्रिया वचः। बलाकाप्रत्ययेनासौ धयश्च वचनैः शुभैः॥ सम्प्रतस्थे स मिथिलां कौतूहलसमन्वितः।<br />Thus meditating in his mind and relying upon the statement of the woman, which was ensured by her knowledge of the death of the female crane, as also by her happy discourse bearing upon the principles of virtue, he (Kaushika), being filled with curiosity.</p>
<p id='5'>अतिक्रामनरण्यानि ग्रामांश्च नगराणि चा॥ ततो जगाम मिथिलां जनकेन सुरक्षिताम्। धर्मसेतुसमाकीर्णां यज्ञोत्सववती शुभाम्॥<br />(He) departed to Mithila and crossed over forests, villages and cities. Then at last he came to Mithila, which was governed by king Janaka. The city was decorated with the flags hoisted by men of various creeds.

Some regenerate persons pointed out to him the place, where he repaired and saw the Fowler seated in the midst of a butcher's yard.</p>

<p id='14'>श्रुत्वा च तस्य तद् वाक्यं स विप्रो भृशविस्मितः द्वितीयमिदमाश्चर्यमित्यचिन्तयत द्विजः॥<br />Hearing these words of his, the Brahmana became greatly astonished. The regenerate person went on meditating-Oh! this is the second marvel!</p>
<p id='15'>अदेशस्थं हि ते स्थानमिति व्याधोऽब्रवीदिदम्। गृहं गच्छाव भगवन् यदि ते रोचतेऽनघ॥<br />The fowler then addressed the Brahmana, saying-Indeed, you are now staying at a place, that is not at all proper for you. O holy one, O faultless one, should you like, let us go to my own abode.</p>
<p id='16'>मार्कण्डेय उवाच बाढमित्येव तं विप्रो हृष्टो वनचमब्रवीत्। अचतस्तु द्विजं कृत्वा स जगाम गृहं प्रति॥<br />Markandeya said : The Brahmana, highly gratified, addressed him, saying, "So be it". Making the Brahmana proceed before him, he (fowler) departed towards his own abode.</p>

Thereupon he addressed the fowler, saying, "It appears to me that this business is not really suitable to you. O father, I greatly regret that you should adopt such a dishonourable profession",</p>

<p id='23'>कृषिगोरक्ष्यवाणिज्यमिह लोकस्य जीवनम्। दण्डनीतिस्त्रयी विद्या तेन लोको भवत्युत॥<br />In this world the chief professions of men are agriculture, the rearing of cows and trade. But in the next world, the acquaintance in ethics and the three special branches of knowledge (the three Vedas) prove most conducive.</p>

Agriculture has been fixed for the Vaishyas; and fighting has been ordained for the Kshatriyas. The vow of Brahmacharya, devotion, repetition of the mantras and truthfulness are always to be observed by the Brahmanas.</p>

<p id='43'>न पापे प्रतिपाप: स्यात् साधुरेव सदा भवेत्। आत्मनैव हतः पापो यः पापं कर्तुमिच्छति॥<br />There should be no wrong over wrong; rather one should deal honestly. The sinful person, who desires to commit a crime, is slain by himself.</p>
<p id='44'>कर्म चैतदसाधूनां वृजिनानामसाधुवत्। न धर्मोऽस्तीति मन्वानाः शुचीनवहसन्ति ये॥ अश्रद्दधाना धर्मस्य ते नश्यन्ति न संशयः। महादृतिरिवाघ्मातः पापो भवति नित्यदा॥<br />By committing a crime one becomes wicked and dishonest. Those who consider that there is no virtue or those, who laugh at the pure and good, these vicious men undoubtedly find decay in the long run. The wicked person daily grows flatulent, even as the leather bag inflated with wind.</p>

O Brahmana, this is Shruti, which may be referred to as one this relating to virtue.</p>

O monarch, the virtue of persons shines again (drives off all sins), if sins are committed out of mistake.</p>

<p id='54'>यथाऽऽदित्यः समुद्यन् वै तमः पूर्वं व्यपोहति। एवं कल्याणमातिष्ठन् सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यते॥<br />Thus seeking salvation, a man is freed from all his sins, even as the sun, upon rising, displays its lustre after it has driven off all darkness.</p>

<p id='56'>अधर्मा धर्मरूपेण तृणैः कूपा इवावृताः। तेषां दमः पवित्राणि प्रलापा धर्मसंश्रिताः। सर्वं हि विद्यते तेषु शिष्टाचारः सुदुर्लभः॥<br />Sinful persons hide themselves under the guise of virtue, even as the wells remain undiscovered on account of the grasses growing over and covering them. The selfcontrol, which they seem to possess, their holiness, their speeches regarding virtue, all these are witnessed in them. But good behaviours are hardly found in them.</p>
<p id='57'>मार्कण्डेय उवाच स तु विप्रो महाप्राज्ञो धर्मव्याधमपृच्छत। शिष्टाचारं कथमहं विद्यामिति नरोत्तम॥<br />Markandeya said : Indeed, that greatly wise Brahmana asked the virtuous flower, saying, "O foremost of men, how shall I know the the virtuous behaviours?"</p>

And self-denial (refraining from the worldly enjoyments) forms the essence of selfcontrol. These attributes are always present in a virtuous conduct.</p>
<p id='65'>ये तु धर्मानसूयन्ते बुद्धिमोहान्विता नराः। अपथा गच्छतां तेषामनुयाता च पीड्यते॥<br />Those persons, who, being intelligent and full of delusions, hate these virtues, surely tread in the sinful path. The men who follow them fall in the abyss of decay.</p>
<p id='66'>ये तु शिष्टाः सुनियताः श्रुतित्यागपरायणाः। धर्मपन्थानमारूढाः सत्यधर्मपरायणाः॥<br />They, who are virtuous and are devoted to the observance of the vows, to the Shrutis and to self-denial; and they who have ascended the paths of virtue and are engaged in speaking truth and observing virtues;</p>
