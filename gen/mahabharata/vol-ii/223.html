<h3>None: Chapter 223</h3><h4>Birth of Skanda</h4><p id='1'>मार्कण्डेय उवाच अग्नीनां विविधा वंशाः कीर्तितास्ते मयानघ। शृणु जन्म तु कौरव्य कार्तिकेयस्य धीमतः॥<br />Markandeya said : O sinless one, O descendant of Kuru, I have told you the history of the various branches of the Agni race. (Now) hear about the birth of the intelligent Kartikeya.</p>
<p id='2'>अद्भुतस्याद्भुतं पुत्रं प्रवक्ष्याम्यमितौजसम्। जातं ब्रह्मर्षिभार्याभिर्ब्रह्मण्यं कीर्तिवर्धनम्॥<br />I shall (now) speak to you about the wonderful and famous and highly effulgent son of Adbhut, who was born of the wives of the Brahmarsis.</p>
<p id='3'>देवासुराः ए । यत्ता विनिघ्नन्तः परस्परम्। तत्राजयन् सदा देवान् दानवा घोररूपिणः॥<br />In the days of yore, the Devas and the Danavas were always engaged in destroying one another. The fearful Danavas were always able to vanquish the Devas.</p>
<p id='4'>वध्यमानं बलं दृष्ट्वा बहुशस्तैः पुरंदरः। स सैन्यनायकार्थाय चिन्तामाप भृशं तदा॥<br />Findings his armies slaughtered by them and being eager to find out a Generalissimo for the celestials army Purandara (Indra) was filled with great anxiety.</p>
<p id='5'>देवसेनां दानवैर्हि भग्नां दृष्ट्वा महाबलः। पालयेद् वीर्यमाश्रित्य स ज्ञेयः पुरुषो मया॥<br />(He thought), "I must find out a powerful person, who will be able to reorganize the celestials army, slaughtered as it is by the Danavas."</p>
<p id='6'>स शैलं मानसं गत्वा ध्यायनर्थमिदं भृशम्। शुश्रावार्तस्वरं घोरमय मुक्तं स्त्रिया तदा॥<br />He then went to the Mandara mountain. When he was deeply engaged in his own thought, he heard a piteous voice of a woman crying.</p>
<p id='7'>अभिधावतु मां कश्चित् पुरुषस्त्रातु चैव ह। पतिं च मे प्रदिशतु स्वयं वा पतिरस्तु मे॥<br />"May some one soon come to me. Let him point out to me a protector or become my protector himself.”</p>
<p id='8'>पुरंदरस्तु तामाह मा भर्नास्ति भयं तव। एवमुक्त्वा ततोऽपश्यत् केशिनं स्थितमग्रतः॥<br />Purandara said to her, “Don't be afraid; you have no fear.” When he said this he saw Keshin (an Asura) standing before him.</p>
<p id='9'>किरीटिनं गदापाणि धातुमन्तमिवाचलम्। हस्ते गृहीत्वा कन्यां तामथैनं वासवोऽब्रवीत्॥<br />Like a hill of metals. He had a crown on his head and a mace in his hand, he held a lady by the hand. To him Vasava thus spoke,</p>
<p id='10'>अनार्यकर्मन् कस्मात् त्वमिमां कन्यां जिहीर्षसि। वलिाणं मां विजानीहि विरमास्याः प्रबाधनात्॥<br />“Why are you insolently behaving towards this lady? Know that I am the wielder of thunder. Stop from doing any violence to this lady."</p>
<p id='11'>केश्युवाच विसृजस्व त्वमेवैनां शत्रैषा प्रार्थिता मया। क्षमं ते जीवतो गन्तुं स्वपुरं पाकशासन॥<br />Keshin said: O chastiser of Paka, leave her alone. I desire to possess her. Do you think that you will be able to return home with your life?</p>
<p id='12'>एवमुक्त्वा गदां केशी चिक्षेपेन्द्रवधाय वै। तामापतन्तीं चिच्छेद मध्ये वलोण वासवः॥<br />Markandeya said : Having said this, Keshin hurled his mace to kill Indra. When falling Vasava cut it down with his thunderbolt.</p>
<p id='13'>अथास्य शैलशिखरं केशी क्रुद्धो व्यवासृजत्। तदा पतन्तं सम्प्रेक्ष्य शैलशृङ्गं शतक्रतुः॥<br />Thereupon Keshin in great anger hurled upon Indra a large mass of rocks. Seeing that the mass of rocks was falling (upon him) Shatakratu.</p>
<p id='14'>बिभेद राजन् वलोण भुवि तन्निपपात ह। पतता तु तदा केशी तेन शृङ्गेण ताडितः॥<br />O king, cut it down with his thunderbolt and it fell on the ground. Keshin himself was wounded by that falling mass of rocks.</p>
<p id='15'>हित्वा कन्यां महाभागां प्राद्रवद् भृशपीडितः। अपयातेऽसुरे तस्मिंस्तां कन्यां वासवोऽब्रवीत्। कासि कस्यासि किछेह कुरुषे त्वं शुभानने॥<br />Having been thus wounded, he fled away leaving the damsel behind. When the Asura was gone, Indra thus spoke to the lady, “Who and whose are you? O beautiful one, what has brought you here?” CHADTCR 29A</p>
