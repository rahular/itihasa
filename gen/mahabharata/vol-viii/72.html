<h3>None: Chapter 245</h3><h4>The means for acquiring the highest subject of acquisition</h4><p id='1'>शुक उवाच वर्तमानस्थैवात्र वानप्रस्थाश्रमे यथा। योक्तव्योऽऽत्मा कथं शक्त्या वेद्यं वै कासता परम्॥<br />Shuka said While living satisfying duly the duties of the forest life, how should one, who tries to attain to that which is the highest object of knowledge, set his soul on Yoga according to be best of his power?</p>
<p id='2'>व्यास उवाच प्राप्य संस्कारमेताभ्यामाश्रमाभ्यां ततः परम्। यत्कार्यं परमार्थ तदिहैकमनाः शृणु॥ तु<br />Vyasa said Having acquired purity by the practice of the first two modes of life, viz., Brahmacharya and domesticity, one should, thereafter, set his mind on Yoga in the third mode of life. Listen now with rapt attention to what should be done for attaining to the highest object of acquisition.</p>

<p id='4'>तद् भवानेवमभ्यस्य वर्ततां श्रूयतां तथा। एक एव चरेद् धर्मं सिद्ध्यर्थमसहायवान्॥<br />Do you then pass your days, having acquired the purity. Listen also to me. One should, alone and without anybody to help him or bear him company, practise Yoga for achieving success.</p>
<p id='5'>एकश्चरति यः पश्यन् न जहाति न हीयते। अनग्निरनिकेतश्च ग्राममन्नार्थमाश्रयेत्॥<br />One who practises Yoga without any one in his company, who sees everything as repetition of his own self, and who never discard anything, never falls away from Liberation. Without keeping the sacrificial fires and without a fixed dwelling, such a person should enter a village for only begging his food.</p>

He should practise penances, with heat fixed on the Supreme. Eating little and that even under proper restrictions, he should not take more than one meal in a day.</p>

<p id='15'>नाभिनन्देत मरणं नाभिनन्देत जीवितम्। कालमेघ प्रतीक्षते निदेशं भृतको यथा॥<br />One following the last mode of life should not regard death with joy. Nor should he regard life with joy. He should only wait for his hour like a servant waiting for his master's command.</p>

The man of faith, therefore who should feel sorry at the prospect of afflicting other other creatures, must abstain absolutely from all acts.</p>
<p id='26'>दानं हि भूताभयदक्षिणायाः सर्वाणि दानान्यधितिष्ठतीह। तीक्ष्णां तनुं यः प्रथमं जहाति सोऽऽनन्त्यमाप्नोत्यभयं प्रजाभ्यः॥<br />The gift of assurances of harmlessness to all creatures is superior in point of merit all other gifts. He who, at the beginning, promises abstention from injury, acquires Liberation whence is the assurance of harınlessness to all creatures.</p>
