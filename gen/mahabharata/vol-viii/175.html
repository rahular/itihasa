<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 348</h3><h4>The practices of men who are devoted to Narayana</h4><p id='1'>जनमेजय उवाच अहो होकन्तिनः सर्वान् प्रीणाति भगवान् हरिः। विधिप्रयुक्तां पूजां च गृह्णाति भगवान् स्वयम्।।।।<br />Janamejaya said The illustrious Hari becomes favourite to them who are whole-mindedly devoted to him. He accepts also all adoration that is offered to Him according to the ordinance.</p>
<p id='2'>ये तु दग्धेन्धना लोके पुण्यपापविवर्जिताः। तेषां त्वयाभिनिर्दिष्टा पारम्पर्यागता गतिः॥<br />Of those persons who have freed themselves from desire, and that are shorn of both merit and demerit, you have spoken of the Knowledge they attain, as handed down from preceptor to preceptor, as the end they acquire.</p>
<p id='3'>चतुर्थ्यां चैव ते गत्यां गच्छन्ति पुरुषोत्तमम्। एकान्तिनस्तु पुरुषा गच्छन्ति परमं पदम्॥<br />Such persons always acquire that end which is the fourth, viz., the essence of the foremost of Purushas or Vasudeva,-through the three others. Those persons, however, who are devoted to Narayana with their whole minds at once acquire the highest end.</p>
<p id='4'>नूनमेकान्तधर्मोऽयं श्रेष्ठो नारायणप्रियः। अगत्वा गतयस्तिस्रो यद् गच्छत्यव्ययं हरिम्॥<br />Forsooth, the Religion of Devotion is superior (to that of Knowledge) and is very dear to Narayana. These, without passing through the three successive stages at once attain to the immutable Hari.</p>
<p id='5'>सहोपनिषदान् वेदान् ये विप्राः सम्यगास्थिताः। पठन्ति विधिमास्थाय ये चापि यतिधर्मिणः॥ तेभ्यो विशिष्टां जानामि गतिमेकान्तिनां नृणाम्। केनैष धर्मः कथितो देवेन ऋषिणापि वा॥<br />The end that is attained by Brahmanas, who, practising due observances, study the Vedas with the Upanishads according to the rules laid down for such study, and by those who follow the Religion of Yatis, is inferior, I think, to that attained by persons devoted whole-mindedly to Hari, Who first promulgated this Religion of Devotion? Was it some god or some Rishi who declared it.</p>
<p id='6'>एकान्तिनां च का चर्या कदा चोत्पादिताविभो। एतन्मे संशयं छिन्धि परं कौतूहलं हि मे॥<br />What are the practices of those practices begin? I have doubts on those subjects. Do you dispell them. Great is my curiosity to her you explain the several points.</p>
<p id='7'>वैशम्पायन उवाच समुपोढेष्वनीकेषु कुरुपाण्डवयोर्मधे। अर्जुने विमनस्के च गीता भगवता स्वयम्॥ अगतिश्च गतिश्चैव पूर्वं ते कथिता मया। गहनो ह्येष धर्मो वै दुर्विज्ञेयोऽकृतात्मभिः॥<br />Vaishampayana said, "When the diverse detachments of the Pandava and the Kuru armies were drawn up in battle array and when Arjuna became dispirited, the holy one himself explained the question of what is the end and what is not the end attained by persons of different characters. I have before this recited to you the words of the holy one. It is difficult to understand the religion preached by the holy one on that occasion. Men of impure souls cannot apprehend it at all.</p>
<p id='8'>सम्मितः समावेदेन पुरैवादियुगे कृतः। धार्यते स्वयमीशेन राजन् नारायणेन च॥<br />Having created this religion in days of yore, viz., in the golden age, in perfect accordance with the Samans, it is borne, O king, by the Supreme Lord, viz., Narayana, himself.</p>
<p id='9'>एतदर्थं महाराज पृष्टः पार्थेन नारदः। ऋषिमध्ये महाभागः शृण्वतोः कृष्णभीष्मयोः॥<br />This very subject was ushered by the highly blessed Partha to Narada in the midst of the Rishis and in the presence of Krishna and Bhishma.</p>
<p id='10'>गुरुणा च मयाप्येष कथितो नृपसत्तम। यथा तत् कथितं तत्र नारदेन तथा शृणु॥<br />My preceptor, viz., the Island-born Krishna heard what Narada said. Receiving it from the celestial Rishis, O best of kings, my preceptor gave it to me in exactly the same way in which he had got it from the celestial Rishi. I shall now recount it to you, O king, in the same way as it has been received from Naradas. Listen, therefore, to me.</p>
<p id='11'>यदासीन्मानसं जन्म नारायणमुखोद्गतम्। ब्रह्मणः पृथिवीपाल तदा नारायणः स्वयम्॥ तेन धर्मेण कृतवान् दैवं पित्र्यं च भारत। फेनपा ऋषयश्चैव तं धर्म प्रतिपेदिरे॥<br />In that cycle when the Creator Brahman, O king, took his birth in the mind of Narayana and came out from the latter's mouth, Narayana himself, performed, O Bharata, his divine and ancestral rites in accordance with this religion. Those Rishis who live upon the froth of water then got it from Narayana.</p>
<p id='12'>वैखानसाः फेनपेभ्यो धर्मं तं प्रतिपेदिरे। वैखानसेभ्यः सोमस्तु ततः सोऽन्तर्दधे पुनः॥<br />From the froth-eating Rishis, this religion was gained by the Rishis, named Vaikhanasas. From the Vaikhanasas Soma got it. Afterwards, it disappeared from the universe.</p>
<p id='13'>यदासीच्चाक्षुषं जन्म द्वितीयं ब्रह्मणो नृप। तदा पितामहेनैव सोमाद् धर्मः परिश्रुतः॥<br />After the second birth of Brahman, viz., when he originated from the eyes of Narayana, O king, the Grandfather (that is, Brahman) then received this religion from Soma.</p>
<p id='14'>नारायणात्मको राजन् रुद्राय प्रददौ च तम्। ततो योगस्थितो रुद्रः पुरा कृतयुगे नृप।॥ बालखिल्यानृषीन् सर्वान् धर्ममेतदपाठयत्। अन्तर्दधे ततो भूयस्तस्य देवस्य मायया॥<br />Having received it thus, Brahman gave this religion, which has Narayana for its soul, to Rudra. In the golden age of that ancient Kalpa, Rudra, devoted to Yoga, 0 king, communicated it to all those Rishis called Valkhilyas. Through the illusion of Narayana, it once more disappeared from the universe.</p>
<p id='15'>तृतीयं ब्रह्मणो जन्म यदासीद् वाचिकं महत्। तत्रैष धर्मः सम्भूतः स्वयं नारायणानृप॥<br />In the third birth of Brahman which was from the speech of Narayana, this religion once more sprang up, O king, from Narayana himself.</p>
<p id='16'>सुपर्णो नाम तमृषिः प्राप्तवान् पुरुषोत्तमात्। तपसा वै सुतप्तेन दमेन नियमेन च।॥<br />Then a Rishi named Suparna acquired it from that foremost of Beings.</p>
<p id='17'>त्रिः परिक्रान्तवानेतत् सुपर्णो धर्ममुत्तमम्। यस्मात् तस्माद् व्रतं ह्येतत् त्रिसौपर्णमिहोच्यते॥<br />The Rishi Suparna used to recite this excellent religion, three times during the day. Therefore it passed by the name of Trisauparna in the world.</p>
<p id='18'>ऋग्वेदपाठपठितं व्रतमेतद्धि दुश्चरम्। सुपर्णाच्चाप्यधिगतो धर्म एष सनातनः॥ वायुना द्विपदां श्रेष्ठ कथितो जगदायुषा। वायोः सकाशात् प्राप्तश्च ऋषिभिर्विघसाशिभिः॥<br />This religion has been referred to in the Rigveda. The duties it enjoins are extremely difficult of observance. From the Rishi Suparna, this eternal religion was acquired, O foremost of men, by the wind god, that sustainer of the lives of all creatures in the universe. The god of wind communicated it to such Rishis as live upon the remnants of sacrificial offerings after feeding guests and others.</p>
<p id='19'>ततो महोदधिश्चैव प्राप्तवान् धर्ममुत्तमम्। अन्तर्दधे ततो भूयो नारायणसमाहितः॥<br />From those Rishis this excellent religion was acquired by the great Ocean. It once more disappeared from the universe and became merged into Narayana.</p>
<p id='20'>यदा भूयः श्रवणजा सृष्टिरासीन्महात्मनः। ब्रह्मणः पुरुषव्याघ्र तत्र कीर्तयतः शृणु॥<br />In the next birth of the great Brahman when he originated from the ear of Narayana, listen, O king, to what took place in that aeon.</p>
<p id='21'>जगत्स्रष्टुमना देवो हरिनारायणः स्वयम्। चिन्तयामास पुरुषं जगत्सर्गकरं प्रभुम्॥<br />The illustrious Narayana, otherwise called Hari, when he was bent upon Creation, thought of a Being who would be powerful enough to create the universe.</p>
<p id='22'>अथ चिन्तयतस्तस्य कर्णाभ्यां पुरुषः स्मृतः। प्रजासर्गकरो ब्रह्मा तमुवाच जगत्पतिः॥<br />While thinking of this, a Being originated from his ears capable to create the universe. The Lord of all called him by the name of Brahman..</p>
<p id='23'>सृज प्रजाः पुत्र सर्वा मुखतः पादतस्तथा। श्रेयस्तव विधास्यामि बलं तेजश्च सुव्रत॥<br />Addressing Brahman, the Supreme Narayana said,—Do you, O son, create all kinds of creatures from your mouth and feet. O you of excellent vows, I shall do what will be good for you, for I shall impart to you both energy and strength sufficient to make you competent for this work.</p>
<p id='24'>धर्मं च मत्तो गृह्णीष्व सात्वतं नाम नामतः। तेन सृष्टं कृतयुगं स्थापयस्व यथाविधि॥<br />Do you receive also from me this excellent religion known by the name of Satvata. Helped by that religion do you create the golden age and ordain it duly.</p>
<p id='25'>ततो ब्रह्मा नमश्चक्रे देवाय हरिमेधसे। धर्मं चाम्यं स जग्राह सरहस्यं ससंग्रहम्॥ आरण्यकेन सहितं नारायणमुखोद्भवम्। उपदिश्य ततो धर्मं ब्रह्मणेऽमिततेजसे॥ त्वं कर्ता युगधर्माणां निराशी:कर्मसंज्ञितम्। जगाम तमसः पारं यत्राव्यक्तं व्यवस्थितम्॥<br />Thus addressed, Brahman bowed his head to the illustrious Harimedhas and received from him that foremost of all religions with all its mysteries and abstract of details, together with the Aranyakas,-the religion which originated from the mouth of Narayana. Narayana then instructed Brahman of incomparable energy in that religion, and addressing him, said,-You are the creator of the duties that are to be observed in the respective cycles! Having said. this to Brahman, Narayana disappeared and went to that place which is beyond the reach of Ignorance, where the unmanifest resides, and which is known by the name of acts without desire of fruits.</p>
<p id='26'>ततोऽथ वरदो देवो ब्रह्मा लोकपितामहः। असृजत् स ततो लोकान् कृत्स्नान् स्थावरजङ्गमान्॥<br />After this, the boon-giving Brahman, the Grandfather of the worlds, created the different worlds with all their mobile and immobile creatures.</p>
<p id='27'>ततः प्रावर्तत तदा आदौ कृतयुगं शुभम्। ततो हि सात्वतो धर्मो व्याप्य लोकानवस्थितः॥<br />The age that first began was highly auspicious and came to be called by the name of Krita. In that age, the religion of Sattva existed, in the entire universe.</p>
<p id='28'>तेनैवाद्येन धर्मेण ब्रह्मा लोकविसर्गकृत्। पूजयामास देवेशं हरि नारायणं प्रभुम्॥<br />With the help of that primeval religion of virtue, Brahman, the Creator of all the worlds, adored the Lord of all the gods, viz., the powerful Narayana otherwise called Hari.</p>
<p id='29'>धर्मप्रतिष्ठाहेतोश्च मनुं स्वारोचिषं ततः। अध्यापयामास तदा लोकानां हितकाम्यया॥<br />For the propagation then of that religion and desirous of benefiting the worlds, Brahman then instructed that Manu who is known by the name of Swarochish in that religion.</p>
<p id='30'>ततः स्वरोचिवः पुत्रं स्वयं शङ्खपदं नृप। अध्यापगत् पुराव्यग्रः सर्वलोकपतिर्विभुः॥<br />Svarochish-Manu, that Lord of all the worlds, that foremost of all persons gifted with power, then cheerfully gave the knowledge of that religion to his own son, O king, who was known by the name of Shankhapada.</p>
<p id='31'>ततः शङ्खपदश्चापि पुत्रमात्मजमौरसम्। दिशां पालं सुवर्णाभमध्यापयत भारत। सोऽन्तर्दधे ततो भूयः प्राप्ते त्रेतायुगे पुनः॥<br />The son of Manu, viz., Shankhapada, imparted the knowledge of that religion to his own son Suvarnabha who was the Regent of the cardinal and subsidiary points. When, upon the expiration of the Krita Yoga, the Treta came, that religion once more disappeared from the world.</p>
<p id='32'>नासिक्ये जन्मनि पुरा ब्रह्मणः पार्थिवोत्तम। धर्ममतं स्वयं देवो हरिर्नारायणः प्रभुः॥ तज्जगादारविन्दाक्षो ब्रह्मणः पश्यतस्तदा। सनत्कुमारो भगवांस्तत: प्राधीतवान् नृप॥<br />In a subsequent birth of Brahman, O best of kings, viz., that which was derived from the nose of Narayana, O Bharata, the illustrious and powerful Narayana or Hari having eyes like lotus petals, himself sang this religion in the presence of Brahman. Then the son of Brahman, created by his will, viz., Sanatkumara, studied this religion.</p>
<p id='33'>सनत्कुमारादपि च वीरणो वै प्रजापतिः। कृतादौ कुरुशार्दूल धर्ममेतदधीतवान्॥<br />From Santakumara, the Prajapati Virana, in the beginning of the Krita age, O foremost of Kurus, obtained this religion.</p>
<p id='34'>वीरणचाप्यधीत्यैनं रैभ्याय मुनये ददौ। रैभ्यः पुत्राय शुद्धाय सुव्रताय सुमेधसे॥ कुक्षिनाम्ने स प्रददौ दिशां पालाय धर्मिणे। ततोऽप्यन्तर्दधे भूयो नारायणमुखोद्भवः॥<br />Having studied it in this way, Virana taught it to the ascetic Raivya. Raivya, in his turn, gave it to his son of pure soul, good vows, and great intelligence viz., Kukshi, that righteous Regent to the cardinal and subsidiary points. After this, that religion born of the mouth of Narayana, once more disappeared from the world.</p>
<p id='35'>अण्डजे जन्मनि पुनर्ब्रह्मणे हरियोनये। एष धर्मः समुद्भूतो नारायणमुखात् पुनः॥<br />In the next birth of Brahman, viz., that which he derived from an egg which originated from Hari, this religion once more issued from the mouth of Narayana.</p>
<p id='36'>गृहीतो ब्रह्मणा राजन् प्रयुक्तश्च यथाविधि। अध्यापिताश्च मुनयो नाम्ना बर्हिषदो नृप॥<br />It was received by Brahman, O king, and practised duly in all its details by him. Brahman then gave it, O king, to those Rishis who are known by the name of Varhishada.</p>
<p id='37'>बर्हिषद्भ्यश्च सम्प्राप्तः सामवेदान्तगं द्विजम्। ज्येष्ठं नामाभिविख्यातं ज्येष्ठसामव्रतो हरिः॥<br />From the Barhishadas it was acquired by a Brahmana well-versed in the Sama-Veda, and known by the name of Jeshthya. And because he was well-versed in the Samans, therefore was he known also by the name of Jeshthyasamavrata-Hari.</p>
<p id='38'>ज्येष्ठाच्चाप्यनुसंक्रान्तो राजानमविकम्पनम्। अन्तर्दधे ततो राजन्नेष धर्मः प्रभो हरेः॥<br />From the Brahmana known by the name of Jeshthya, this religion was obtained by a king of the name of Avikampana. After this, that religion, derived from the powerful Hari, once more disappeared from the world.</p>
<p id='39'>यदिदं सप्तमं जन्म पद्मजं ब्रह्मणो नृप। तत्रैव धर्मः कथितः स्वयं नारायणेन ह॥ पितामहाय शुद्धाय युगादौ लोकधारिणे। पितामहश्च दक्षाय धर्ममेतं पुरा ददौ॥<br />During the seventh birth of Brahman from the lotus, O king, that sprang from the navel of Narayana, this religion was once more preached by Narayana himself, to the Grandsire of pure soul, the Creator of all the worlds, in the beginning of this Kalpa. The Grandfather gave it in days of yore to Daksha.</p>
<p id='40'>ततो ज्येष्ठे तु दौहित्रे प्रादाद् दक्षो नृपोत्तम। आदित्ये सवितुर्येष्ठे विवस्थाजगृहे ततः॥<br />Daksha, in his turn, gave it to the eldest of all the sons of his daughters, O monarch, viz., Aditya, who is senior in age to Savitri. From Aditya, Vivasvat got it.</p>
<p id='41'>त्रेतायुगादौ च ततो विवस्वान् मनवे ददौ। मनुश्च लोकभूत्यर्थं सुतायेक्ष्वाकवे ददौ॥<br />In the beginning of the Treta Yuga, Vivasvat gave the knowledge of this religion to Manu. Manu, for the protection and support of all the worlds, then gave it to his son Ikshvaku.</p>
<p id='42'>इक्ष्वाकुणा च कथितो व्याप्य लोकानवस्थितः। गमिष्यति क्षयान्त च पुनर्नारायणं नृप॥<br />Promulgated by Ikshvaku, that religion overspreads the whole world. When the universal destruction sets in, it will once more return to Narayana and be merged in Him.</p>
<p id='43'>यतीनां चापि यो धर्मः स ते पूर्वं नृपोत्तमा कथितो हरिगीतासु समासविधिकल्पितः॥<br />The religion which is followed and practised by the Yatis, has, O best of kings, been described to you before this in the Harigita, with all its ordinances in brief.</p>
<p id='44'>नारदेन सुसम्प्राप्तः सरहस्यः ससंग्रहः। एष धर्मो जगन्नाथात् साक्षान्नारायणान्नृप॥<br />The celestial Rishi Narada got it from that Lord of universe, viz., Narayana himself, O king, with all its mysteries and abstract of details.</p>
<p id='45'>एवमेष महान् धर्म आद्यो राजन् सनातनः। दुर्विज्ञेयो दुष्करश्च सात्वतैर्धार्यते सदा॥<br />Thus, O king, this foremost of religions is primeval and eternal. Incapable of being understood easily and highly difficult of being pervaded by the quality of godness.</p>
<p id='46'>धर्मज्ञानेन चैतेन सुप्रयुक्तेन कर्मणा। अहिंसाधर्मयुक्तेन प्रीयते हरिरीश्वरः॥<br />It is by means of acts that are wellperformed and done with a perfect knowledge of duties,-acts, that is, in which there is nothing of injury to any creature,-that Hari the Supreme Lord became pleased.</p>
<p id='47'>एकव्यूहविभागो वा क्वचिद् द्विर्गृहसंज्ञितः। त्रियूँहश्चापि संख्यातश्चतुर्दूहश्च दृश्यते॥<br />Some persons worship Narayana as endued with only one form, viz., that O Aniruddha. Some worship Him as endued with two forms, viz., that of Aniruddha and Pradyumna. Some adore Him as having three forms, viz., Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Sankarshana. A fourth section adore him as having four forms, viz., Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Shankarshana, and Vasudeva.</p>
<p id='48'>हरिरेव हि क्षेत्रज्ञो निर्ममो निष्कलस्तथा। जीवश्च सर्वभूतेषु पञ्चभूतगुणातिगः॥<br />Hari is Himself the Kshetrajna (Soul). He is without parts. He is the Individual Soul in all creatures, getting over the five primal elements.</p>
<p id='49'>मनश्च प्रथितं राजन् पञ्चेन्द्रियसमीरणम्। एष लोकविधिधीमानेष लोकविसर्गकृत्॥<br />He is the Mind, O king, that directs and governs the five senses. Gifted with the highest intelligence, He is the Ordainer of the universe, and the Creator thereof.</p>
<p id='50'>अकर्ता चैव कर्ता च कार्य कारणमेव च। यथेच्छति तथा राजन् क्रीडते पुरुषोऽव्ययः॥<br />He is both active and inactive. He is both Cause and Effect. He is the one immutable Soul, who sports as He likes, O king.</p>
<p id='51'>एष एकान्तधर्मस्ते कीर्तितो नृपसत्तम। मया गुरुप्रसादेन दुर्विज्ञेयोऽकृतात्मभिः॥<br />Thus have I recounted to you the Religion of Devotion, O best of kings, which cannot be comprehended by persons of impure souls but which I acquired through the favour of my preceptor.</p>
<p id='52'>एकान्तिनो हि पुरुषा दुर्लभा बहवो नृप। यद्येकान्तिभिराकीर्णं जगत् स्यात् कुरुनन्दन॥ अहिंसकैरात्मविद्भिः सर्वभूतहिते रतैः। भवेत् कृतयुगप्राप्तिराशी: कर्मविवर्जिताः॥<br />Persons are very rare, O king, who are devoted whole-mindedly to Narayana. If, O son of Kuru's race, the world has been full of such persons, who are full of universal mercy, who are possessed of the knowledge of the soul, and who are always busy with doing good to others, then the Krita age would have begun and all men would have undertaken works without desire of fruit.</p>
<p id='53'>एवं स भगवान् व्यासो गुरुर्मम विशाम्पते। कथयामास धर्मज्ञो धर्मराज्ञे द्विजोत्तमः॥ ऋषीणां संनिधौ राजशृण्वतोः कृष्णभीष्मयोः। तस्याप्यकथयत् पूर्वं नारदः सुमहातपाः॥<br />It was even thus, O king, that foremost of twice-born ones, viz., the illustrious Vyasa, my preceptor, well-versed in all duties, described to king Yudhishthira the just this religion of Devotion, in the presence of many Rishis and in the hearing of Krishna and Bhishma. He had got it from the celestial Rishi Narada having penances for wealth.</p>
<p id='54'>देवं परमकं ब्रह्म श्वेतं चन्द्राभमच्युतम्। यत्र चैकान्तिनो यान्ति नारायणपरायणाः॥<br />Those persons who are whole-mindedly devoted to Narayana in the end, that greatest of gods, identical with Brahma, pure in complexion, effulgent like the moon, and immutable.</p>
<p id='55'>जनमेजय उवाच एवं बहुविधं धर्मं प्रतिबुद्धैर्निषेवितम्। न कुर्वन्ति कथं विप्रा अन्ये नानाव्रते स्थिताः॥<br />I see that those twice-born ones whose souls have been awakened, pactise various kinds of duties. Why it is that other Brahmanas do not practise those duties but observe other kinds of vows and rites?</p>
<p id='56'>वैशम्पायन उवाच तिस्रः प्रकृतयो राजन् देहबन्धेषु निर्मिताः। सात्त्विकी राजसी चैव तामसी चैव भारत॥<br />Three kinds of disposition, O king, have been created about all embodied creatures, viz., that which appertains to the quality of goodness, that which appertains to the quality of Darkness, and lastly that which appertains to the quality of Ignorance, O Bharata.</p>
<p id='57'>देहबन्धेषु पुरुषः श्रेष्ठः कुरुकुलोद्वह। सात्त्विकः पुरुषव्याघ्र भवेन्मोक्षाय निश्चितः॥<br />As regards embodied creatures, perpetuator of Kuru's race, that person is the foremost who follows the quality of Goodness, for, O foremost of men, it is certain that he will acquire Liberation.</p>
<p id='58'>अत्रापि स विजानाति पुरुषं ब्रह्मवित्तमम्। नारायणपरो मोक्षस्ततो वै सात्त्विकः स्मृतः॥<br />It is with the help of this very quality of Goodness that one endued therewith succeeds in understanding the person who is conversant with Brahma. As regards Liberation, it is entirely dependent upon Narayana. Hence it is that Liberation is considered as made up of the quality of Goodness.</p>
<p id='59'>मनीषितं च प्राप्नोति चिन्तयन् पुरुषोत्तमम्। एकान्तभक्तिः सततं नारायणपरायणः॥<br />By thinking of the foremost of Beings, the man who is devoted whole-mindedly to Narayana, gains great wisdom.</p>
<p id='60'>मनीषिणो हि ये केचिद् यतयो मोक्षधर्मिणः। तेषां विच्छिन्नतृष्णानां योगक्षेमवहो हरिः॥<br />Those persons who are possessed of wisdom, who follow the practices of Yatis and the Religion of Liberation,-those persons whose thirst has been satisfied_always find that Hari favours them with the fruition of their desire.</p>
<p id='61'>जायमानं हि पुरुष यं पश्येन्मधुसूदनः। सात्त्विकस्तु स विज्ञेयो भवेन्मोक्षे च निश्चितः॥<br />That man subject to birth (and death) upon whom Hari casts a kind eye should be known as gifted with the quality of Goodness and devoted to the acquisition of Liberation.</p>
<p id='62'>सांख्ययोगेन तुल्यो हि धर्म एकान्तसेवितः। नारायणात्मके मोक्षे ततो यान्ति परां गतिम्॥<br />The religion followed by a person who is devoted whole-mindely to to Narayana is considered as similar or equal in merit to the system of the Sankhyas.</p>
<p id='63'>नारायणेन दृष्टस्तु प्रतिबुद्धो भवेत् पुमान्। एवमात्मेच्छया राजन् प्रतिबुद्धो न जायते॥<br />By following that religion one acquires the highest end by attaining to Liberation which has Narayana for its soul. That person upon whom Narayana looks with mercy succeeds in becoming awakened.</p>
<p id='64'>राजसी तामसी चैव व्यामिश्रे प्रकृती स्मृते। तदात्मकं हि पुरुषं जायमानं विशाम्पते॥<br />No one, O king, can become awakened through his own wishes. That nature which partakes of both Darkness and Ignorance is said to be mixed.</p>
<p id='65'>प्रवृत्तिलक्षणैर्युक्तं नावेक्षति हरिः स्वयम्।<br />Hari never casts a kind eye upon the person subject to birth who has such a mixed nature and who has, on that account the principle of action in him.</p>
<p id='66'>पश्यत्येनं जायमानं ब्रह्मा लोकपितामहः॥ रजसा तमसा चैव मानसं समभिप्लुतम्।<br />Only Brahman, the Grandfather of the worlds, cares for the person who is subject to me birth the death because of his mind being overwhelmed with the two inferior qualities of Darkness and Ignorance.</p>
<p id='67'>कामं देवा ऋषयश्च सत्त्वस्था नृपसत्तम॥ हीनाः सत्त्वेन शुद्धेन ततो वैकारिकाः स्मृताः।<br />Forsooth, the gods and the Rishis are endued with the qualities of Goodness, best of kings! But then they who are divested of that quality in its subtile form are always considered to be of mutable nature.</p>
<p id='68'>जनमेजय उवाच कथं वैकारिको गच्छेत् पुरुषः पुरुषोत्तमम्॥ वद सर्वं यथादृष्टं प्रवृत्तिं च यथाक्रमम्।<br />Janamejaya said, How can one who is subject to change succeed in attaining to that foremost of Being? Do tell me all this, which is, no doubt, know to you! Do you describe to also of Renunciation in due order.</p>
<p id='69'>वैशम्पायन उवाच सुसूक्ष्मं सत्त्वसंयुक्तं संयुक्तं त्रिभिरक्षरैः॥ पुरुषः पुरुषं गच्छेनिष्क्रियः पञ्चविंशकः।<br />Vaishampayana sajd— When it becomes able to abstain entirely from acts, the twenty-fifth, i.e., the Individual Soul, succeeds in attaining to the foremost of Beings which is highly subtile, which is invested with the quality of Goodness, and which is highly of Goodness, and which is fraught with the essence symbolised by the three letters of the alphabet (viz., A. U. and M.)</p>
<p id='70'>एवमेकं सांख्ययोगं वेदारण्यकमेव च॥ परस्पराङ्गान्येतानि पाञ्चरात्रं च कथ्यते। एष एकान्तिनां धर्मो नारायणपरात्मकः॥<br />The Sankhya system, the Aranyaka-Veda, and the Pancharatra scriptures, are all identical and form parts of one whole. This is the religion of those who are devoted whole. mindedly to Narayana—the religion that has Narayana for its Soul.</p>
<p id='71'>स्तमेव राजनपुनराविशन्ति। इमे तथा ज्ञानमहाजलौघा नारायणं वै पुनराविशन्ति॥<br />As waves of the ocean, rising from the ocean, rush away from it only to return to it in the long run so various sorts of knowledge, originating from Narayana, return to Narayana in the end.</p>
<p id='72'>एष ते कथितो धर्मः सात्वतः कुरुनन्दन। कुरुरुष्वैनं यथान्यायं यदि शक्तोऽसि भारत्॥<br />I have thus explained to you, O son of Kuru's race, what the religion of Goodness is. If you be qualified for it, O Bharata, do you practise that religion duly.</p>
<p id='73'>एवं हि स महाभागो नारदो गुरवे मम। श्वेतानां यतिनां चाह एकान्तगतिमव्ययाम्॥<br />Thus did the highly-blessed Narada explain to my preceptor.-the Island-born Krishna-the eternal and immutable course called Ekanta, followed by the Whites as also by Yatis.</p>
<p id='74'>व्यासश्चकथयत् प्रीत्या धर्मपुत्राय धीमते। स एवायं मया तुभ्यमाख्यातः प्रसृतो गुरोः॥<br />Pleased with Dharma's son Yudhisthira, Vyasa imparted this religion to king Yudhisthira the just who was endued with great intelligence. Derived from my preceptor I have also communicated it to you.</p>
<p id='75'>इत्थं हि दुश्चरो धर्म एष पार्थिवसत्तम। यथैव त्वं तथैवान्ये भवन्तीह विमोहिताः॥<br />O best of kings, this religion is, for these reasons, highly difficult of practice. Others, hearing it, become as much stupefied as you have allowed yourself to be.</p>
<p id='76'>कृष्ण एव हि लोकानां भावनो मोहनस्तथा। संहारकारकश्चैव कारणं च विशांपते॥<br />It is Krishna who is the protector of the universe and its beguiler. It is He who is the destroyer and the cause, O king.</p>
