O foremost of all persons gifted with intelligence, tell me this, agreeably to the scriptures. What is this that you are doing? What also are the fruits desired by you of those rites which you are performing. are</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>नारद उवाच त्वयैतत् कथितं पूर्वं दैवं कर्तव्यमित्यपि। दैवतं च परो यज्ञः परमात्मा सनातनः॥<br />Narada said You said to me formerly that rites and observances in honour of the gods should be performed. You said that the rites in honour of the gods from the highest sacrifice and are equivalent to the worship of the Eternal and Supreme Soul.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>ततस्तद्भावितो नित्यं यजे वैकुण्ठमव्ययम्। तस्माच्च प्रसृतः पूर्वं ब्रह्मा लोकपितामहः॥<br />Thus instructed, I always sacrifice in honour of the eternal and iminutable Vishnu through these rites that I perform in adoring the gods. It is from that Supreme Deity that Brahman, the Grandfather of all the worlds, sprang in days of yore.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>मम वै पितरं प्रीतः परमेष्ठ्यप्यजीजनत्। अहं संकल्पजस्तस्य पुत्रः प्रथमकल्पितः॥<br />That Brahman, otherwise called Prameshthi, filled with cheerfulness, caused my father (Daksha) to come into being. I was the son of Brahman, created before all others, by his will.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>यजामि वै पितृन् साधो नारायणविधौ कृते। एवं स एव भगवान् पिता माता पितामहः॥<br />Orighteous and illustrious one, I am performing these rites in honour of the departed manes for the sake of Narayana and according to those ordinances that have been ordained by himself. The illustrious Narayana is the father, mother, and grandfather.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>इज्यते पितृयज्ञेषु तथा नित्यं जगत्पतिः। श्रुतिश्चाप्यपरा देवी पुत्रान् हि पितरोऽयजन्॥<br />In all sacrifices performed in honour of the departed manes, it is that Lord of the universe who is worshipped. On one occasion, the gods, who were father, taught their children the Shrutis.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>वेदश्रुतिः प्रणष्टा च पुनरध्यापिता सुतैः। ततस्ते मन्त्रदाः पुत्राः पितृत्वमुपपेदिरे॥<br />Having lost their knowledge of the Shrutis, and father had to acquire it again from those sons to whom they had come municated it. On account of this incident, the sons, who had thus to communicate the Mantras to their father, acquired the status of fathers.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>वै नूनं पुरैतद् विदितं युवयोर्भावितात्मनोः। पुत्राश्च पितरश्चैव परस्परमपूजयन्॥<br />Forsooth, what the gods did on that occasion is well known to you two. Sons and fathers had thus to adore each other.</p>

I wish to know, however, the reason why the departed manes in days of yore acquired the name of Pindas.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>नरनारायणावूचतुः इमां हि धरणी पूर्वं नष्टां सागरमेखलाम्। गोविन्द उज्जहाराशु वारां रूपमास्थितः।१२।।<br />Nara and Narayana said The Earth, in days of yore, with her belt of seas, disappeared from the view. Govinda, taking the form of a gigantic boar, raised her up.</p>

He then said to himself,—These balls, shaken off my tusk, have fallen on the Earth towards the south of her surface! Led by this, I declare that these should be known henceforth by the name of departed manes.</p>
