<h3>None: Chapter 256</h3><h4>What is death</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच य इमे पृथिवीपाला: शेरते पृथिवीतले। पृतनामध्य एते हि गतसंज्ञा महाबलाः॥<br />Yudhisthira said These kings who lie on the Earth's surface amid their respective armies, these princes of great power, are now all deprived of life.</p>
<p id='2'>एकैकशो भीमबला नागायुतबलास्तथा। एते हि निहताः संख्ये तुल्यतेजोबलैनरैः॥<br />Every one of these powerful kings was endued with strength equal to that of ten thousand elephants. Alas! these have all have killed by men equally powerful and strong.</p>
<p id='3'>नैषां पश्यामि हन्तारं प्राणिनां संयुगे परम्। विक्रमेणोपसम्पन्नास्तेजोबलसमन्विताः॥<br />I do not see any one else that could kill any of these men in battle. All of them were gifted with great prowess, great energy, and great strength.</p>
<p id='4'>अथ चेमे महाप्राज्ञाः शेरते हि गतासवः। मृता इति च शब्दोऽयं वर्तत्येषु गतासुषु॥<br />Highly wise, they are now lying dead on the naked earth. about them, however, that are deprived of life, the word that is used is that they are dead.</p>
<p id='5'>इमे मृता नृपतयः प्रायशो भीमविक्रमाः। तत्र मे संशयो जातः कुतः संज्ञा मृता इति॥<br />All these highly powerful kings are said to be dead. On this subject a doubt lies in my mind. Whence is life and whence is death.</p>
<p id='6'>कस्य मृत्युः कुतो मृत्युः केन मृत्युरिह प्रजाः। हरत्यमरसंकाश तन्मे ब्रूहि पितामह॥<br />Who is it that dies? whence is death? Whence is death? Why does death take away living creatures. O grandfather, tell me this, O you who are like a god.</p>
<p id='7'>भीष्म उवाच पुरा कृतयुगे तात राजा ह्यासीदकम्पनः। स शत्रुवशमापन्नः संग्रामे क्षीणवाहनः॥<br />Bhishma said In days of yore, in the Krita age, O son, there was a king of the name of Anukampaka. His cars, elephants, horse and men having been reduced in number, he succumbed to the power of his enemies in battle.</p>
<p id='8'>तस्य पुत्रो हरि म नारायणसमो बले। स शत्रुभिर्हतः संख्ये सबलः सपदानुगः॥<br />His son, named Hari, who was like Narayana himself in strength, was in that battle killed by his enemies along with all his followers and troops.</p>
<p id='9'>स राजा शत्रुवशगः पुत्रशोकसमन्वितः। यदृच्छया शान्तिपरो ददर्श भुवि नारदम्॥<br />Stricken with grief consequent on the death of his son, and himself brought under the control of enemies, the king devoted himself thence to a life of peacefulness. One day, while wandering listlessly he met the sage Narada on the Earth.</p>
<p id='10'>तस्मै स सर्वमाचष्ट यथावृत्तं जनेश्वरः। शत्रुाभिर्ग्रहणं संख्ये पुत्रस्य मरणं तथा॥<br />The king told Narada all that had taken place, viz., the death of his son in battle and his own capture by his enemies.</p>
<p id='11'>तस्य तद् वचनं श्रुत्वा नारदोऽथ तपोधनः आख्यानमिदमाचष्ट पुत्रशोकापहं तदा॥<br />Having heard him Narada, endued with wealth of penances, then recited to him the following narrative for removing his grief consequent on the death of his son.</p>
<p id='12'>नारद उवाच राजशृणु समाख्यानमद्येदं बहुविस्तरम्। यथावृत्तं श्रुतं चैव मयेदं वसुधाधिप॥<br />Narada said Listen now, O king, to the following long narrative which had taken place. I myself heard it formerly, O king!</p>
<p id='13'>प्रजाः सृष्टाः महातेजाः प्रसार्गे पितामहः। अतीव वृद्धा बहुला नामृष्यत पुनः प्रजाः॥<br />Endued with great energy, the Grandfather, at the time of the creation of the universe, created a large number of living beings. These multiplied greatly, and none of them died.</p>
<p id='14'>न ह्यन्तरमभूत् किञ्चित् क्वचिज्जन्तुभिरच्युत। निरुच्छ्वासमिवोन्नद्धं त्रैलोक्यमभवन्नृप॥<br />There was not a part of the universe which was not overcrowded with living creatures, O you of great glory! Indeed, O king, the three worlds appeared to swell with living beings, and became, as it were, breathless.</p>
<p id='15'>तस्य चिन्ता समुत्पन्ना संहारं प्रति भूपते। चिन्तयन् नाध्यगच्छच्च संहारे हेतुकारणम्॥<br />Then, O king, the Grandfather thought as to how he should destroy the surplus population. Thinking of the matter, the Self-create, however, could not decide by what means the destruction of life was to be performed.</p>
<p id='16'>तस्य रोषान्महाराज खेभ्योऽग्निरुदतिष्ठत। तेन सर्वा दिशो राजन् ददाह स पितामहः॥<br />Thereupon, O king, Brahman gave way to anger and in consequence of his anger a fire issued out of his body. With that fire born of his anger, the Grandfather burnt all the quarters of the universe, O king.</p>
<p id='17'>ततो दिवं भुवं खं च जगच्च सचराचरम्। ददाह पावको राजन् भगवत्कोपसम्भवः॥<br />Indeed, that fire begotten of the Divine Lord's anger, O king, burnt Heaven and Earth and the Sky and the whole Universe with all its mobile and immobile beings.</p>
<p id='18'>तत्रादह्यन्त भूतानि जङ्गमानि ध्रुवाणि च। महता क्रोधवेगेन कुपिते प्रपितामहे॥<br />Truly, when the Grandfather thus became angry, all mobile and immobile beings began to be consumed by the irresistible power of that anger.</p>
<p id='19'>ततोऽध्वरजटः स्थाणुर्वेदाध्वरपतिः शिवः। जगाम शरणं देवो ब्रह्माणं परवीरहा।॥<br />Then the divine and sacred Sthanu, that destroyer of hostile heroes, that lord of the Vedas and the scriptures, filled with pity, tried to please Brahma.</p>
<p id='20'>तस्मिन्नभिगते स्थाणौ प्रजानां हितकाम्यया। अब्रवीत् परमो देवो ज्वलन्निव तदा शिवम्॥ करवाण्यद्य कं काम वरा.ऽसि मतो मम। कर्ता ह्यस्मि प्रियं शम्भो तव यद्धदि वर्तते॥<br />When Sthanu came to Brahma out of feelings of benevolence, the great God addressed him, saying,-you deserved boons at my hands! What desire of yours shall I fulfil? I shall do you good by doing whatever you wish.</p>
