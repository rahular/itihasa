<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 340</h3><h4>The creation of Rudras etc. The Religion of Renunciation</h4><p id='1'>शौनक उवाच कथं स भगवान् देवो यज्ञेष्वग्रहरः प्रभुः। यज्ञधारी च सततं वेदवेदाङ्गवित् तथा॥<br />Saunaka said is that illustrious god, viz., the powerful Narayana, who is a master of the Vedas and their branches, at once the doer and the enjoyer of sacrifices?</p>
<p id='2'>निवृत्तं चास्थितो धर्मं क्षमी भागवतः प्रभुः। निवृत्तिधर्मान् विदधे स एव भगवान् प्रभुः॥<br />Endued with forgiveness, he has adopted, again, the Religion of Renunciation. Indeed, it is that holy and powerful one who has himself laid down the duties of Renunciation.</p>
<p id='3'>कथं प्रवृत्तिधर्मेषु भागार्हा देवताः कृताः। कथं निवृत्तिधर्माश्च कृता व्यावृत्तबुद्धयः॥<br />Why then has he made many of the gods the takers of shares in sacrifices which, of course, are all due to the Religion of Action. Why has he again created some with an opposite disposition, for they follow the ordinances of the Religion of Renunciation.</p>
<p id='4'>एतं नः संशयं सौते छिन्थि गुह्यं सनातनम्। त्वया नारायणकथाः श्रुता वै धर्मसंहिताः॥<br />Do you, O Suta, remove this doubt of ours. This doubt seems to be eternal and is filled with great mystery. You have heard all discourses on Narayana, which are consistent with the (other) scriptures.</p>
<p id='5'>सौतिरुवाच जनमेजयेन यत् पृष्टः शिष्यो व्यासस्य धीमतः। तत् तेऽहं कथयिष्यामि पौराणं शौनकोत्तम॥<br />O excellent Saunaka, I shall recount to you what Vaishampayana, the disciple of the intelligent Vyasa, said when questioned on these very topics by king Janamejaya.</p>
<p id='6'>श्रुत्वा माहात्म्यमेतस्य देहिनां परमात्मनः। जनमेजयो महाप्राज्ञो वैशम्पायनमब्रवीत्॥<br />Having heard the discourse on the glory of Narayana who is the Soul of all embodied creatues, Janamejaya, gifted with great intelligence and wisdom, asked Vaishampayana about these very topics.</p>
<p id='7'>जनमेजय उवाच इमे सब्रह्मका लोकाः ससुरासुरमानवाः। क्रियास्वभ्युदयोक्तासु सक्ता दृश्यन्ति सर्वशः॥<br />The whole world of Being, with Brahman, the gods, the Asuras, and human beings are seen to be deeply attached to acts which yield prosperity.</p>
<p id='8'>मोक्षश्चोक्तस्त्वया ब्रह्मन् निर्वाणं परमं सुखम्। ये तु मुक्ता भवन्तीह पुण्यपापविवर्जिताः॥ ते सहस्रर्चिषं देवं प्रविशन्तीह शुश्रुम्।<br />Liberation has, O twice-born one, been described by you to be the highest happiness and to consist of the cessation of existence. They who being shorn of both merit and demerit, become liberated, succeed, we hear, in entering the great God of a thousand rays.</p>
<p id='9'>अयं हि दुरनुष्ठेयो मोक्षधर्मः सनातनः॥ यं हित्वा देवताः सर्वा हव्यकव्यभुजोऽभवन्।<br />It seems to be, O Brahmana, that the eternal religion of Liberation is highly difficult of observance. Turning away from it, all the gods have become enjoyers of the libations of clarified butter poured with Mantras on sacrificial fires and other offerings presented to them by similar means.</p>
<p id='10'>किं च ब्रह्मा च रुद्रश्च शक्रश्च बलभित् प्रभुः॥ सूर्यस्ताराधिपो वायुरग्निर्वरुण एव च। आकाशं जगती चैव ये च शेषा दिवौकसः॥ प्रलयं न विजानन्ति आत्मनः परिनिर्मितम्। ततस्तेनास्थिता मार्ग ध्रुवमक्षरमव्ययम्॥<br />Then, again, Brahman, and Rudra, the powerful Sakra the killer of Vala, the Sun, the Lord of the stars, the Wind-god, the god of fire, the god of the Waters, Infinite Space, the Universe too and the rest of the dwellers of heaven,-these, it seems do not know the way of securing an annihilation of conscious existence that is encompassed by one's own efforts.</p>
<p id='11'>स्मृत्वा कालपरीमाणं प्रवृत्तिं ये समास्थिताः। दोषः कालपरीमाणे महानेष क्रियावताम्॥<br />Hence, perhaps, they have not followed the path which is certain, indestructible, and immutable. Hence, perhaps turning away from that path, they have adopted the Religion of Action which leads to conscious existence that is measured by time.</p>
<p id='12'>एतन्मे संशयं विप्र हृदि शल्यमिवार्पितम्। छिन्धीतिहासकथनात् परं कौतूहलं हि मे॥<br />This, indeed, is one great defeat of those who are wedded to acts, for all their rewards are for the time being. This doubt, O twiceborn one, exists in my heart like a dagger! Tear it out by recounting to me some discourses of old on this subject. Great is my curiosity to listen to you.</p>
<p id='13'>कथं भागहराः प्रोक्ता देवताः क्रतुषु द्विज। किमर्थं चाध्वरे ब्रह्मन्निज्यन्ते त्रिदिवौकसः॥<br />Why, O twice-born one, have the gods been said to be takers of their respective shares of sacrificial offerings presented to them with the help of Mantras in sacrifices of various kinds? Why, again, are the dwellers of heaven worshipped in sacrifices?</p>
<p id='14'>ये च भागं प्रगृह्णन्ति यज्ञेषु द्विजसत्तम। ये यजन्तो महायज्ञैः कस्य भागं ददन्ति वै॥<br />And, O best of twice-born ones to whom do they, who partake of offerings in sacrifices performed to their honour, themselves make offerings when they perform great sacrifices?</p>
<p id='15'>वैशम्पायन उवाच अहो गूढतमः प्रश्नस्त्वया पृष्टो जनेश्वर। नातप्ततपसा ह्येष नावेदविदुषा तथा॥ नापुराणविदा चैव शक्यो व्याहर्तुमञ्जसा।<br />The question you have put to me, O king, relates to a deed mystery. No man can quickly answer it who has not practised penances, and who is not acquainted with the Puranas.</p>
<p id='16'>हन्त ते कथयिष्यामि यन्मे पृष्टः पुरा गुरुः॥ कृष्णद्वैपायनो व्यासो वेदव्यासो महानृषिः।<br />I shall, however, answer you by reciting to you what my preceptor the Island-born Krishna, otherwise called Vyasa, the great Rishi who has divided the Vedas, had said to us on a former occasion when questioned by us.</p>
<p id='17'>सुमन्तुजैमिनिश्चैव पैलश्च सुदृढव्रतः॥ अहं चतुर्थः शिष्यो वै पञ्चमश्च शुकः स्मृतः।<br />Sumanta, and Jaimini, and Paila of firm vows, and myself as the fourth, and Shuka. as the fifth, were disciples of the illustrious Vyasa.</p>
<p id='18'>एतान् समागतान् सर्वान् पञ्च शिष्यान् दमान्वितान्॥२० शौचाचारसमायुक्ताञ्जिक्रोधाञ्जितेन्द्रियान्। वेदानध्यापयामास महाभारतपञ्चमान्॥<br />We, five in all, endued with self-control and purity of observances, had completely mastered anger and controlled our senses. Our preceptor used to teach us the Vedas having the Mahabharata for their fifth.</p>
<p id='19'>मेरौ गिरिवरे रम्ये सिद्धचारणसेविते। तेषामभ्यस्यतां वेदान् कदाचित् संशयोऽभवत्।॥ एष वै यस्त्वया पृष्टस्तेन तेषां प्रकीर्तितः। ततः श्रुतो मया चापि तवाख्येयोऽद्य भारत॥<br />Once on a time, on the breast of that foremost of mountains, viz., the delightful Meru, inhabited by Siddhas and Charanas while we were engaged in reading the Vedas, this very doubt sprang in our minds, that has been given vent to by you to-day. We, therefore, asked our preceptor about it. It heared the answer that our preceptor made. I shall now recount that answer to you, O Bharata.</p>
<p id='20'>शिष्याणां वचनं श्रुत्वा सर्वाज्ञानतमोनुदः। पराशरसुतः श्रीमान् व्यासो वाक्यमथाब्रवीत्॥<br />Hearing the words that were addressed to him by his disciples, that remover of all sorts of darkness represented by ignorance, viz., the blessed Vyasa the son of Parashara, said these words:मया हि सुमहत् तप्तं तपः परमदारुणम्।</p>
<p id='21'>भूतं भव्यं भविष्यं च जानीयामिति सत्तमाः॥<br />I have practised the austerest of penances. You best of men, I am fully conversant with the Past, the Present, and the Future.</p>
<p id='22'>तस्य मे तप्ततपसो निगृहीतेन्द्रियस्य च। नारायणप्रसादेन क्षीरोदस्यानुकूलतः॥ त्रैकालिकमिदं ज्ञानं प्रादुर्भूतं यथेप्सितम्।<br />On account of those penances of mine and of the control under which I kept my senses, while I lived on the shores of the ocean of milk, Narayana became pleased with me. As the result of the great God's gratification, this omniscience about the Past, the Present, and Future that was desired by me, sprang in my inind.</p>
<p id='23'>तच्छृणुध्वं यथान्यायं वक्ष्ये संशयमुत्तमम्॥ यथा वृत्तं हि कल्पादौ दृष्टं मे ज्ञानचक्षुषा।<br />Listen now to me as I describe to you, in due order, this great doubt that has perplexed your minds. I have, with the eye of knowledge, seen, all that took place in the beginning of the aeon.</p>
<p id='24'>परमात्मेति यं प्राहुः सांख्ययोगविदो जनाः॥ महापुरुषसंज्ञां स लभते स्वेन कर्मणा। तस्मात् प्रसूतमव्यक्तं प्रधानं तं विदुर्बुधाः॥<br />He whom both the Sankhyas and the Yogins call by the name of the Supreme Soul, comes to be regarded as the foremost Purusha on account of his own deeds. From Him originate Prakriti that is called the unmanifest or Pradhana by the learned.</p>
<p id='25'>अव्यक्ताद् व्यक्तमुत्पन्नं लोकसृष्ट्यर्थमीश्वरात्। अनिरुद्धो हि लोकेषु महानात्मेति कथ्यते॥<br />From the powerful Unmanifest sprang, for the creation of all the worlds, he that is called Aniruddha. That Aniruddha is known among all creatures by the name of the Great Soul.</p>
<p id='26'>योऽसौ व्यक्तत्वमापन्नो निर्ममे च पितामहम्। सोऽहंकार इति प्रोक्तः सर्वतेजोमयो हि सः॥<br />It is that Aniruddha who, becoming manifest, created the Grandfather Brahman. Aniruddha is known by another name, viz., consciousness, and is gifted with every sort of energy.</p>
<p id='27'>पृथिवी वायुराकाशमापो ज्योतिश्च पञ्चमम्। अहंकारप्रसूतानि महाभूतानि पञ्चधा॥<br />Earth, Wind, Ether, Water, and Fire numbering the fifth—these are the five Great Creatures that have originated from Consciousness.</p>
<p id='28'>महाभूतानि सृष्ट्वैव तान् गुणान् निर्ममे पुनः। भूतेभ्यश्चैव निष्पन्ना मूर्तिमन्तश्च ताशृणु॥<br />Having created the Great Creatures he then created their qualities. Combining the Great Creatures, he then created various embodied Beings. Hear me as I describe them to you.</p>
<p id='29'>मरीचिरङ्गिराचात्रिः पुलस्त्यः पुलहः क्रतुः। वसिष्ठश्च महात्मा वै मनुः स्वायम्भुवस्तथा॥ ज्ञेयाः प्रकृतयोऽष्टौ ता यासु लोकाः प्रतिष्ठिताः।<br />Marichi, Angiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, the great Vashistha, and the Self-created Manu,-these should be known as the eight elements. Upon these depend all the worlds.</p>
<p id='30'>वेदवेदाङ्गसंयुक्तान् यज्ञान् यज्ञाङ्गसंयुतान्॥ निर्ममे लोकसिद्ध्यर्थं ब्रह्मा लोकपितामहः। अष्टाभ्यः प्रकृतिभ्यश्च जातं विश्वमिदं जगत्।॥<br />Then the Grandfather of all the worlds, viz., Brahman, created, for the success of all creatures, the Vedas with all their branches as also the sacrifices with their limbs. From these eight elements have originated this vast universe.</p>
<p id='31'>रुद्रो रोषात्मको जातो दशान्यान् सोऽसृजत् स्वयम्। एकादशैते रुद्रास्तु विकारपुरुषाः स्मृताः॥<br />Then originated Rudra from the principle of anger. Taking birth, he created ten others like him. These eleven Rudras are called by name of Vikara-Purushas.</p>
<p id='32'>ते रुद्राः प्रकृतिश्चैव सर्वे चैव सुरर्षयः। उत्पन्ना लोकसिद्ध्यर्थं ब्रह्माणं समुपस्थिताः॥<br />The Rudras, the Prakritis, and the several celestial Rishis, having come into existence approached Brahman, with the object of upholding the universe and its work.</p>
<p id='33'>वयं सृष्टा हि भगवंस्त्वया च प्रभविष्णुना। येन यस्मिन्नधीकारे वर्तितव्यं पितामह॥<br />Addressing the Grandfather, they said,-We have been created, O holy one, by you, O you of great power. Tell us, O Grandfather, which of us should be vested with what jurisdiction.</p>
<p id='34'>योऽसौ त्वयाभिनिर्दिष्टो ह्यधिकारोऽर्थचिन्तकः। परिपाल्यः कथं तेन साहंकारेण कर्तृणा॥<br />What jurisdictions have been created by you for supervising what particular affairs? Which of us should, gifted with what sort of consciousness, shall take charge of which of these?</p>
<p id='35'>प्रदिशस्व बलं तस्य योऽधिकारार्थचिन्तकः। एवमुक्तो महादेवो देवांस्तानिदमब्रवीत्॥<br />Do you ordain also to each of us the measure of strength that we are to have for satisfying the duties duties of our our respective jurisdictions.-Thus addressed by them, the great god replied to them in the following way.</p>
<p id='36'>ब्रह्मोवाच साध्वहं ज्ञापितो देवा युष्माभिर्भद्रमस्तु वः। ममाप्येषा समुत्पन्ना चिन्ता या भवतां मता॥<br />Brahman said You have done well, ye gods, in speaking to me of this matter. Blessed be you all! I was thinking of this very subject that has drawn your attention.</p>
<p id='37'>लोकत्रयस्य कृत्स्नस्य कथं कार्यः परिग्रहः। कथं बलक्षयो न स्याद् युष्माकं ह्यात्मनश्च मे॥<br />How should the three words be maintained and kept agoing? How should your strength and mine be taken advantage of for the accomplishment of that object.</p>
<p id='38'>इतः सर्वेऽपि गच्छामः शरणं लोकसाक्षिणम्। महापुरुषमव्यक्तं स नो वक्ष्यति यद्धितम्॥<br />Let all of us, leaving this place, go that unmanifest and foremost of Beings who is the witness of the world, for seeking his protection. He will tell us what is for our behoof.</p>
<p id='39'>ततस्ते ब्रह्मणा सार्धमृषयो विबुधास्तथा। क्षीरोदस्योत्तरं कूलं जग्मुर्लोकहितार्थिनः॥<br />After this, those gods and Rishis, with Brahman, went to the northern shores of the ocean of milk, desirous of doing good to the three worlds.</p>
<p id='40'>ते तपः समुपातिष्ठन् ब्रह्मोक्तं वेदकल्पितम्। स महानियमो नाम तपश्चर्यासु दारुणः॥<br />Arrived there, they began to practise those austere penances that are said by Brahman in the Vedas. Those austerest of penances are known by the name of Mahaniyama.</p>
<p id='41'>ऊर्ध्वा दृष्टिर्बाहवश्च एकाग्रं च मनोऽभवत्। एकपादाः स्थिताः सर्वे काष्ठभूताः समाहिताः॥<br />They stood there with mind fixed, immovable as stakes of wood, and with eyes upturned and arms raised upward.</p>
<p id='42'>दिव्यं वर्षसहस्रं ते तपस्तप्त्वा सुदारुणम्। शुश्रुवुर्मधुरां वाणी वेदवेदाङ्गभूषिताम्॥<br />For a thousand divine years they were engaged in those severe penances. At the conclusion of that time they heard these sweet words in harmony with the Vedas and their branches.</p>
<p id='43'>श्रीभगवानुवाच भो भोः सब्रह्मका देवा ऋषयश्च तपोधनाः। स्वागतेनाय॑ वः सर्वाश्रावये वाक्यमुत्तमम्॥<br />The Blessed and Holy One said You gods and Rishis having asceticism for wealth with Brahman in your company, honouring you all with welcome, I say to you these words.</p>
<p id='44'>विज्ञातं वो मया कार्यं तच्च लोकहितं महत्। प्रवृत्तियुक्तं कर्तव्यं युष्मत्प्राणोपबृंहणम्॥<br />I know what is in your hearts! Verily, your thoughts are for the behoof of the three worlds. I shall multiply your energy and strength, investing the same with disposition for work.</p>
<p id='45'>सुतप्तं च तपो देवा ममाराधनकाम्यया। भोल्यथास्य महासत्त्वास्तपसः फलमुत्तमम्॥<br />You gods, well have you practised these penances from desire of worshipping me. You foremost of Beings, enjoy now the excellent fruits of those austerities which you have practised.</p>
<p id='46'>एष ब्रह्मा लोकंगुरुर्महाललोकपितामहः। यूयं च विबुधश्रेष्ठा मां यजध्वं समाहिताः॥<br />This Brahman is the Lord of all the words. Gifted with power, he is the Grandfather of all creatures. You also are foremost of gods. Do you all, with concentrated minds, celebrate sacrifices for my glory.</p>
<p id='47'>ते सर्वे भागान् कल्पयध्वं यज्ञेषु मम नित्यशः। तथा श्रेयोऽभिधास्यामि यथाधीकारमीश्वराः॥<br />In those sacrifices which you will perform, do ye always give me a part of the sacrificial offerings. I shall then, ye lords of creation, assign to each of you your respective spheres and ordain what will be for your behoof.</p>
<p id='48'>वैशम्पायन उवाच श्रुत्वैतद् देवदेवस्य वाक्यं हृष्टतनूरुहाः। ततस्ते विबुधाः सर्वे ब्रह्मा च महर्षयः॥<br />Vaishampayana said, Hearing these words of that God of gods, all those gods and great Rishis and Brahman became filled with such delight that the hair on their bodies stood erect.</p>
<p id='49'>वेददृष्टेन विधिना वैष्णवं क्रतुमाहरन्। तस्मिन् सत्रे सदा ब्रह्मा स्वयं भागमकल्पयत्॥<br />They immediately made arrangements for a sacrifice in honour of Vishnu according to the Vedic ordinances. In that sacrifice, Brahman himself assigned a portion of the offerings to Vishnu.</p>
<p id='50'>देवा देवर्षयश्चैव स्वं स्वं भागमकल्पयन्। ते कार्तयुगधर्माणो भागाः परमसत्कृताः॥<br />Similarly the gods and the celestial Rishis also, dedicated similar portions each to the great God. The portions, thus offered with great respect to Vishnu, were about both the quantity and the quality of the articles used, according to the ordinances laid down for the Krita age.</p>
<p id='51'>प्राहुरादित्यवर्णं तं पुरुषं तमसः परम्। बृहन्तं सर्वगं देवमीशानं वरदं प्रभुम्॥<br />The gods and the Rishis and Brahman, in that sacrifice, worshipped the great God as one having the complexion of the Sun, as the foremost of Beings, situate beyond the reach of Ignorance, vast, pervading all things, the Supreme Lord of all, the giver of boons, and endued with power.</p>
<p id='52'>ततोऽथ वरदो देवस्तान् सर्वानमरान् स्थितान्। अशरीरो बभाषेदं वाक्यं खस्थो महेश्वरः॥<br />Thus worshipped by them the boon-giving and great God, invisible and bodiless, addressed those assembled celestials from heaven and said to them</p>
<p id='53'>येन यः कल्पितो भागः स तथा मामुपागतः। प्रीतोऽहं प्रदिशाम्यद्य फलमावृत्तिलक्षणम्॥<br />I have received the offerings dedicated by you in this sacrifice. I am pleased with all of you. I shall confer rewards on you that will, however, be fraught with ends from where there will be return.</p>
<p id='54'>एतद् वो लक्षणं देवा मत्प्रसादसमुद्भवम्। स्वयं यज्ञैर्यजमानाः समाप्तवरदक्षिणैः॥ युगे युगे भविष्यध्वं प्रवृत्तिफलभागिनः।<br />This shall be your distinctive characteristic, ye gods, from this day, on account of my favours and kindness for you. Celebrating sacrifices in every cycle, with large presents, you will become enjoyers of fruits born of Action.</p>
<p id='55'>यज्ञैर्ये चापि यक्ष्यन्ति सर्वलोकेषु वै सुराः॥ कल्पयिष्यन्ति वो भागांस्ते नरा वेदकल्पितान्।<br />You gods, those men also that will celebrate sacrifices, according to the Vedic ordinances, will give to all of you, shares of their sacrificial offerings.</p>
<p id='56'>यो मे यथा कल्पितवान् भागमस्मिन् महाक्रतौ॥ स तथा यज्ञभागार्हो वेदसूत्रे मया कृतः।<br />In the Veda-sutras I make him the receiver of a share like that which he has himself offered one in this sacrifice.</p>
<p id='57'>यूयं लोकान् भावयध्वं यज्ञभागफलोचिताः॥ सर्वार्थचिन्तका लोके यथाधीकारनिर्मिताः।<br />Created to superintend the affairs of your respective jurisdictions, do you uphold the worlds according to your strength as dependent on the shares you receive in those sacrifices.</p>
<p id='58'>याः क्रियाः प्रचरिष्यन्ति प्रवृत्तिफलसत्कृताः॥ आभिराप्यायितबला लोकान् वै धारयिष्यथा<br />Indeed, receiving strength from those rites and observances that will be in vogue in the several worlds, originating from the fruits of action, do ye continue to uphold the affairs of those worlds.</p>
<p id='59'>यूयं हि भाविता यज्ञैः सर्वयज्ञेषु मानवैः॥ मां ततो भावयिष्यध्वमेषा वो भावना मम।<br />Strengthened by the sacrifices that will be celebrated by men, ye will strengthen me. These are the thoughts that I cherish for you</p>
<p id='60'>इत्यर्थं निर्मिता वेदा यज्ञाश्चौषधिभिः सह॥ एभिः सम्यक् प्रयुक्तैर्हि प्रीयन्ते देवताः क्षितौ।<br />It is for this that I have created the Vedas and sacrifices and plants and herbs. Duly served with these by human beings on Earth, the gods will be pleased.</p>
<p id='61'>निर्माणमेतद् युष्माकं प्रवृत्तिगुणकल्पितम्॥ मया कृतं सुरश्रेष्ठा यावत्कल्पक्षयादिह। चिन्तयध्वं लोकहितं यथाधीकारमीश्वराः॥<br />You foremost of gods, till the end of this aeon, I have ordained your creation, making your constitutions depend upon the result of the religion of Action. You foremost of Beings, do you then, about your respective jurisdictions, engage yourselves in seeking the welfare of the three worlds.</p>
<p id='62'>मरीचिरनिराश्चात्रिः पुलस्त्यः पुलहः क्रतुः। वसिष्ठ इति सप्तैते मानसा निर्मिता हि ते॥<br />Marichi, Angiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, and Vasistha,-these seven Rishis have been created by the fiat of the will.</p>
<p id='63'>एते वेदविदो मुख्या वेदाचार्याश्च कल्पिताः। प्रवृत्तिधर्मिणश्चैव प्राजापत्ये च कल्पिताः॥<br />These will become the foremost of all persons versed in the Vedas. In fact, they will become the preceptors of the Vedas. They will follow the Religion of Action, for they have been intended to devote themselves to the act of procreating children.</p>
<p id='64'>अयं क्रियावतां पन्था व्यक्तीभूतः सनातनः। अनिरुद्ध इति प्रोक्तो लोकसर्गकरः प्रभुः॥<br />This is the eternal path of creatures engaged in acts and observances. The powerful Lord who is charged with the creation of all the worlds is called Aniruddha.</p>
<p id='65'>सनः सनत्सुजातश्च सनकः ससनन्दनः। सनत्कुमारः कपिल: सप्तमश्च सनातनः॥ सप्तैते मानसाः प्रोक्ता ऋषयो ब्रह्मणः सुताः। स्वयमागतविज्ञाना निवृत्ति धर्ममास्थिताः॥<br />Sana, Sanatsujata, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatkumara, Kapila, and Sanatana,—these seven Rishis are known as the spiritual sons of Brahman. Their knowledge comes to them of itself. These seven follow the Religion of Renunciation.</p>
<p id='66'>एते योगविदो मुख्या: सांख्यज्ञानविशारदाः। आचार्या धर्मशास्त्रेषु मोक्षधर्मप्रवर्तकाः॥<br />They are the foremost of all persons conversant with Yoga. They have a profound knowledge of the Sankhya philosophy. They are teachers of the scriptures on duty and it is they who introduce the duties of the Religion of Renunciation and cause them flow in the worlds.</p>
<p id='67'>यतोऽहं प्रसृतः पूर्वमव्यक्तात् त्रिगुणो महान्। तस्मात् परतरो योऽसौ क्षेत्रज्ञ इति कल्पितः॥<br />From Nature has sprung Consciousness and the three great qualities. Transcending Nature is called Soul.</p>
<p id='68'>सोऽहं क्रियावतां पन्थाः पुनरावृत्तिदुर्लभः। यो यथा निर्मितो जन्तुर्यस्मिन् यस्मिश्च कर्मणि॥ प्रवृत्तौ वा निवृत्तौ वा तत्फलं सोऽश्नुते महत्। एष लोकगुरुर्ब्रह्मा जगदादिकरः प्रभुः॥<br />That Soul is myself. The path of those who follow acts is fraught with return. One cannot, by that path, reach the place whence there is no return. Different creatures have been created with different objects. Some are intended for the Path of Action and some for that of Renunciation. One enjoys the the reward, according to the path that he follows. This Brahman is the lord of all the worlds. Endued with power, it is he who creates the universe.</p>
<p id='69'>एष माता पिता चैव युष्माकं च पितामहः। मयानुशिष्टो भविता सर्वभूतवरप्रदः॥<br />He is your mother and father, and he is your grandfather. At my behest, he will grant boons to all creatures.</p>
<p id='70'>अस्य चैवात्मजो रुद्रो ललाटाद् यः समुत्थितः। ब्रह्मानुशिष्टो भविता सर्वभूतधरः प्रभुः॥<br />His son Rudra, who has originated from his brow at his behest, will, gifted with power, uphold all created beings.</p>
<p id='71'>गच्छध्वं स्वानधीकारांश्चिन्तयध्वं यथाविधि। प्रवर्तन्तां क्रियाः सर्वाः सर्वलोकेषु मा चिरम्॥<br />Go you to your respective jurisdictions, and seek, according to the ordinances, the welfare of the world! Let all the scriptural acts flow in all the worlds. Let there be no delay in this.</p>
<p id='72'>प्रदिश्यन्तां च कर्माणि प्राणिनां गतयस्तथा। परिनिष्ठितकालानि आयूषीह सुरोत्तमाः॥<br />You foremost of gods, do ye ordain the acts of all creatures and the ends that they are come by. Do ye also set the limits of the lives of all creatures.</p>
<p id='73'>इदं कृतयुगं नाम कालः श्रेष्ठः प्रवर्तितः। अहिंस्या यज्ञपशवो युगेऽस्मिन् न तदन्यथा॥<br />This present cycle that is going on is the foremost of all epochs and should be known by the name of Krita. In this cycle living creatures should not be celebrated. It should be as I ordain and let it not be otherwise.</p>
<p id='74'>चतुष्पात् सकलो धर्मो भविष्यत्यत्र वै सुराः। ततस्त्रतायुगं नाम त्रयी यत्र भविष्यति॥<br />In this age, ye celestials, virtue will flourish in full. After this age will come the cycle called Treta. The Vedas, in that cycle, will lose one quarter. Only three of them will exist.</p>
<p id='75'>प्रोक्षिता यत्र पशवो वधं प्राप्स्यन्ति वै मखे। यत्र पादश्चतुर्थो वै धर्मस्य न भविष्यति॥<br />In the sacrifices that will be celebrated in that age, animals, after dedication with the help of sacred Mantras, will be killed. As regards virtue, again, it will lose one quarter; only three quarters thereof will remain.</p>
<p id='76'>ततो वै द्वापरं नाम मिश्रः कालो भविष्यति। द्विपादहीनो धर्मश्च युगे तस्मिन् भविष्यति॥<br />On the termination of the Treta, will come the mixed Yoga known by the name of Dvapara. In that cycle, virtue will lose two quarters and only two quarters thereof will remain.</p>
<p id='77'>ततस्तिष्येऽथ सम्प्राप्ते युगे कलिपुरस्कृते। एकपादस्थितो धर्मो यत्र तत्र भविष्यति॥<br />Upon the termination of Dvapara, the cycle that will set in will be called Tish, and it will come with Kali walking in the van. Virtue will lose full three quarters. Only a quarter thereof will exist in all places.</p>
<p id='78'>देवा देवर्षयश्चोचुस्तमेवंवादिनं गुरुम्। एकपादस्थिते धर्मे यत्र क्वचन गामिनि॥ कथं कर्तव्यमस्माभिर्भगवंस्तद् वदस्व नः।<br />When the great God said these words, the gods and the celestial Rishis addressed him and said,-If only a fourth part of virtue is to exist in that age in every place, tell us, O Holy One, where shall we then go and what shall we do?</p>
<p id='79'>श्रीभगवानुवाच यत्र वेदाश्च यज्ञाश्च तपः सत्यं दमस्तथा॥ अहिंसाधर्मसंयुक्ताः प्रचरेयुः सुरोत्तमाः। स वो देशः सेवितव्यो मा वोऽधर्मः पदा स्पृशेत्।।८९<br />You foremost of gods, ye should, in that age, go to such places where the Vedas and Sacrifices and Penances and Truth and selfcontrol, accompanied by duties fraught with mercy for all creatures, will still continue. Sin will never be able to affect you at all.</p>
<p id='80'>व्यास उवाच तेऽनुशिष्टा भगवता देवाः सर्षिगणास्तथा। नमस्कृत्वा भगवते जग्मुर्देशान् यथेप्सितान्॥<br />Vyasa said Thus commanded by the great God, the gods with all the Rishis bowed their heads to him and then proceeded to the places they desired.</p>
<p id='81'>गतेषु त्रिदिवौकःसु ब्रह्मैकः पर्यवस्थितः। दिदृक्षुर्भगवन्तं तमनिरुद्धतनौ स्थितम्॥<br />After the celestiats had left that place, only Brahman remained there, desirous of seeing the great Deity then living in the form of Aniruddha.</p>
<p id='82'>तं देवो दर्शयामास कृत्वा हयशिरो महत्। साङ्गानावर्तयन् वेदान् कमण्डलुत्रिदण्डधृक्॥<br />The foremost of gods then appeared before Brahman having assumed a form that had a huge equine head. Carrying a pitcher and the triple stick, he appeared before Brahman, reciting the Vedas with all their branches.</p>
<p id='83'>ततोऽश्वशिरसं दृष्ट्वा तं देवममितौजसम्। लोककर्ता प्रभुर्ब्रह्मा लोकानां हितकाम्यया॥ मूर्ध्वा प्रणम्य वरदं तस्थौ प्राञ्जलिरग्रतः। स परिष्वज्य देवेन वचनं श्रावितस्तदा॥<br />Seeing the great Deity of immeasurable energy in that form with an equine head, the powerful Brahman, the Creator of all the worlds, moved by the desire of doing good to his Creation, adored that boon-giving Lord with his head down and stood before him with hands joined in respect. The great Deity embraced Brahman and then told him these words.</p>
<p id='84'>श्रीभगवानुवाच लोककार्यगती: सर्वास्त्वं चिन्तय यथाविधि। धाता त्वं सर्वभूतानां त्वं प्रभुर्जगतो गुरुः॥ त्वय्यावेशितभारोऽहं धृति प्राप्स्याम्यथाजसा।<br />The Holy One said Do you, O Brahman, duly think of the courses of acts which creatures should follow. You are the great ordainer of all created Beings, You are the Master and the Lord of the universe. Placing this burthen on you I shall soon be free from anxiety.</p>
<p id='85'>यदा च सुरकार्यं ते अविषां भविष्यति॥ प्रादुर्भावं गमिष्यामि तदाऽऽत्मज्ञानदैशिकः।<br />At such time, however, when it will be difficult for you to accomplish the work of the gods, I shall then appear in incarnate forms perceiving the gravity of the emergencies.</p>
<p id='86'>एवमुक्त्वा हयशिरास्तत्रैवान्तरधीयत॥ तेनानुशिष्टो ब्रह्मापि स्वलोकमचिराद् गतः।<br />With these words, that grand form with the equine head vanished then and there. Having received his behest, Brahman too proceeded speedily to his own region.</p>
<p id='87'>एवमेष महाभागः पद्मनाभः सनातनः॥ यज्ञेष्वग्रहरः प्रोक्तो यज्ञधारी च नित्यदा।<br />It is for this, O Blessed One, that the eternal lotus-navelled deity became the acceptor of the first share offered in sacrifices and hence it is that He is called the eternal upholder of all Sacrifices.</p>
<p id='88'>निवृत्तिं चास्थितो धर्म गतिमक्षयधर्मिणाम्। प्रवृत्तिधर्मान् विदधे कृत्वा लोकस्य चित्रताम्॥<br />He himself adopted the Religion of Renunciation, the end after which those creatures seek who are desirous of eternal fruits. He laid down at the same time the Religion of Action for others, with the view of giving variety to the universe.</p>
<p id='89'>स आदिः स मध्यः स चान्तः प्रजानां स धाता स धेयं स कर्ता स कार्यम्। युगान्ते प्रसुप्तः सुसंक्षिप्य लोकान् युगादौ प्रबुद्धो जगद्व्युत्ससर्ज॥<br />He is the beginning, He is the middle, and He is the end of all created Beings. He is their Creator and He is the actor and He is the act. Having withdrawn the universe into Himself at the end of the cycle, He enters into sleep, and awakening at the beginning of another cycle, He once more creates the universe.</p>
<p id='90'>तस्मै नमध्वं देवाय निर्गुणाय महात्मने। अजाय विश्वरूपाय धाम्ने सर्वदिवौकसाम्॥<br />Do you all bow to that Illustrious One who is gifted with a high soul and who is above the : three qualities, who is Unborn, abode or refuge of all the dwellers of heaven.</p>

<p id='93'>समुद्रवासिने नित्यं हरये मुञ्जकेशिने। शान्ताय सर्वभूतानां मोक्षधर्मानुभाषिणे॥<br />Bow Him who always lives in the Ocean, and who is called Hari, and whose hair is like the blades of the Munja grass. Bow to Him who is Peace and Tranquillity, and who gives the Religion of Liberation to all creatures.</p>

<p id='96'>गुह्याय ज्ञानदृश्याय अक्षराय क्षराय च। एष देवः संचरति सर्वत्रगतिरव्ययः॥<br />Bow to Him who is unravelled, who is capable of being apprehended by knowledge only, who is both indestructible and destructible. The supreme Deity, who is iminutable, permeates all things.</p>
<p id='97'>एष चैतत् परं ब्रह्म ज्ञेयो विज्ञानचक्षुषा। एवमेतत् पुरा दृष्टं मया वै ज्ञानचक्षुषा॥ कथितं तच्च वै सर्वं मया पृष्टेन तत्त्वतः।<br />He is the Supreme Lord who can be known with the help of the eye of Knowledge alone. It was thus that, helped by the eye of Knowledge, I saw, in days of yore, that foremost of gods.</p>
<p id='98'>क्रियतां मद्वचः शिष्याः सेव्यतां हरिरीश्वरः। गीयतां वेदशब्दैश्च पूज्यतां च यथाविधि॥<br />Asked by you, I have told you everything in full, ye disciples, and do you act according to my words and dutifully serve the Supreme Lord called Hari. Do you sing His praises in Vedic words and adore and worship Him also according to due rites.</p>
<p id='99'>वैशम्पायन उवाच इत्युक्तास्तु वयं तेन वेदव्यासेन धीमता। सर्वे शिष्या: सुतश्चास्य शुकः परमधर्मवित्॥<br />Vaishampayana said It was thus that the compiler of the Vedas, gifted with great intelligence, discoursed to us, accosted by us on that occasion. His son, the highly pious Shuka, and all his disciples listened to him while he delivered that discourse.</p>
<p id='100'>स चास्माकमुपाध्यायः सहास्माभिर्विशाम्पते। चतुर्वेदोद्गताभिस्तमृग्भिः समभितुष्टुवे॥<br />Our preceptor, with ourselves, O king, then worshipped the great Deity with Richs extracted from the four Vedas.</p>
<p id='101'>एतत् ते सर्वमाख्यातं यन्मां त्वं परिपृच्छसि। एवं मेऽकथयद् राजन् पुरा द्वैपायनो गुरुः॥<br />I have thus told you everything about what you had asked me. It was thus, O king, that our Island-born preceptor discoursed to us.</p>
<p id='102'>यश्चेदं शृणुयान्नित्यं यश्चैनं परिकीर्तयेत्। नमो भगवते कृत्वा समाहितमतिर्नरः॥ भवत्यरोगो मतिमान् बलरूपसमन्वितः। आतुरो मुच्यते रोगाद् बद्धो मुच्येत बन्धनात्॥ कामान् कामी लभेत् कामं दीर्घ चायुरवाप्नुयात्।<br />He, who, having uttered the words-'I bow to the holy Lord',-frequently listens, with rapt attention, to this discourse or reads or recites it to others, becomes gifted with intelligence and health, and possessed of beauty and strength If ill, he becomes freed from that illness; if fettered, freed from his bonds. The man who has desires gets (by this) the fruition of all his desires, and easily acquires a long life also.</p>
