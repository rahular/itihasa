<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 364</h3><h4>The story of the Naga king Padma</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>ब्राह्मण उवाच आश्चर्यं नात्र संदेहः सुप्रीतोऽस्मि भुजङ्गमा अन्वर्थोपगतैर्वाक्यैः पन्थानं चास्मि दर्शितः॥<br />Forsooth, this is highly wonderful, ONaga. I have been highly pleased by listening to you. By these words of yours that are fraught with subtile meaning, you have shown me the way I am to follow.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>स्वस्ति तेऽस्तु गमिष्यामि साधो भुजगसत्तम। स्मरणीयोऽस्मि भवता सम्प्रेषणनियोजनैः॥<br />Blessed be you, I wish to depart hence, O best of Nagas. You should remember me now and then and enquire after me sending your servants.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>नाग उवाच अनुक्त्वा हृद्गतं कार्यं क्वेदानीं प्रस्थितौ भवान्। उच्यदां द्विज यत् कार्यं यदर्थं त्वमिहागतः॥<br />The Naga said The object that brought you here is still in your mind, for you have not as yet given it out to me. Where then will you go? Tell me, O twice-born one, what should be done by me, and what that object is which brought you here.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>उक्तानुक्ते कृते कार्ये मामामन्त्र्य द्विजर्षभ। मया प्रत्यभ्यनुज्ञातस्ततो यास्यसि सुव्रत॥<br />After the fulfilment of your business, whatever it is, expressed or unexpressed in speech, you may depart, O foremost of twiceborn persons, saluting me and dismissed by me cheerfully, O you of excellent vows.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>न हि मां केवलं दृष्ट्वा त्यक्त्वा प्रणयवानिह। गन्तुमर्हसि विप्रर्षे वृक्षमूलगतो यथा॥<br />You have conceived a friendship for me. O twice-born Rishi, you should not depart from this place after having only seen me, yourself sitting under the shade of this tree.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>त्वयि चाहं द्विजश्रेष्ठ भवान् मयि न संशयः। लोकोऽयं भवतः सर्वः का चिन्ता मयि तेऽनघ॥<br />You have become dear to me and I have become dear to you. All the persons in this city are yours. What objection then, O sinless one, you have to pass some time in my house.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>ब्राह्मण उवाच एवमेतन्महाप्राज्ञ विदितात्मन् भुजङ्गम। नातिक्रान्तास्त्वया देवाः सर्वथै व यथातथम्॥<br />The Brahmana said It is even so, O you of great wisdom, O Naga, who have acquired a knowledge of the Soul. It is very true that the gods are not superior to you in any respect.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>स एव त्वं स एवाहं योऽहं स तु भवानपि। अहं भवांश्च भूतानि सर्वे यत्र गताः सदा॥<br />He that is yourself is varily myself, as that is myself is truly yourself. Myself, yourself, and all other creatures, shall all have to enter into the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>आसीत् तु मे भोगपते संशयः पुण्यसंचये। सोऽहमुच्छव्रतं साधो चरिष्याम्यर्थसाधनम्॥<br />A doubt had entered my mind, O king of Nagas, in the matter of the best means for acquiring virtue or merit. That doubt has been removed by your discourse, for I have learnt the value of the Unccha vow.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>एष मे निश्चयः साधो कृतं कारणमुत्तमम्। आमन्त्रयामि भद्रं ते कृतार्थोऽस्मि भुजङ्गम॥<br />I shall hence follow that yow which is so very efficacious in producing beneficial consequences. That, O blessed one, has become my certain conclusion now, based on good reasons. I take your leave. Blessing to you. My object has been done, ONaga.</p>
