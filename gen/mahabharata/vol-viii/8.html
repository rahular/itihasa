<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>भीष्म उवाच आत्मनानर्थयुक्तेन पापे निविशते मनः। स्वकर्मकलुषं कृत्वा कृच्छ्रे लोके विधीयते॥<br />Bhishma said 'If the mind is stricken with desire, anger and other evil passions, it then inclines towards sin. If one's acts are sullied by sin, he is obliged to dwell in painful regions.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>दुर्भिक्षादेव दुर्भिक्षं क्लेशात् क्लेशं भयाद् भयम्। मृतेभ्यः प्रमृतं यान्ति दरिद्राः पापकारिणः॥<br />Sinful men are born as poor men and suffer again and again the pangs of fainine, woe, fear, and death.</p>

<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>प्रियदेवातिथेयाश्च वदान्याः प्रियसाधवः। क्षेम्यमात्मवतां मार्गमास्थिता हस्तदक्षिणम्॥<br />They, on the other hand, who respects god and guests, who are liberal who love good and honest men, enjoy for their acts of charity, that happy way which belongs to persons of purified souls.</p>

<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>अचोद्यमानानि यथा पुष्पाणि च फलानि च। स्वं कालं नातिवर्तन्ते तथा कर्म पुरा कृतम्॥<br />Pristine acts develop their consequences in their own proper time even as flowers and fruits, without any outward efforts, never fail to appear when the proper season sets in.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>सम्मानश्चावमानश्च लाभालाभौ क्षयोदयौ। प्रवृत्ता विनिवर्तन्ते विधानान्ते पुनः पुनः॥<br />After the ordained consequences of pristine acts have been dissipated (by enjoyment or sufferance), honour and disgrace, profit and loss, development and decay no longer come. This takes place again and again.</p>

<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>यथा धेनुसहस्रेषु वत्सो विन्दति मातरम्। तथा पूर्वकृतं कर्म कर्तारमनुगच्छति॥<br />As a calf recognises and comes to it mother in the midst of even a thousand kine, so the pristine acts recognise and visit the doer in his new life.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>समुन्नमग्रतो वस्त्रं पश्चाच्छुध्यति कर्मणा। उपवासैः प्रतप्तानां दीर्घं सुखमनन्तकम्॥<br />Washed in water a piece of cloth becomes clean. Likewise, men, repenting (for their past misdeeds), get eternal happiness by proper penances.</p>
