<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 350</h3><h4>Account of Soul</h4><p id='1'>जनमेजय उवाच वहवः पुरुषा ब्रह्मन्नुताहो एक एव तु। को ह्यत्र पुरुषः श्रेष्ठः को वा योनिरिहोच्यते॥<br />Janamejaya said O twice-born one, are there many souls or is there only one? Who, in the universe, is the foremost of Souls? What, again, is said to be the source of all things?</p>
<p id='2'>वैशम्पायन उवाच वहवः पुरुषा लोके सांख्ययोगविचारणे। नैतदिच्छन्ति पुरुषमेकं कुरुकुलोद्वह॥<br />Vaishampayana said, In the Sankhya and the Yoga Systems many are the Souls spoken of. O preceptor of Kuru's race, those who follow these systems do not wish to assert that there is but one Purusha in the universe.</p>
<p id='3'>बहूनां पुरुषाणां च यथैका योनिरुच्यते। तथा तं पुरुषं विश्वव्याख्यास्यामि गुणाधिकम्॥ नमस्कृत्वा च गुरवे व्यासाय विदितात्मने। तपोयुक्ताय दान्ताय वन्द्याय परमर्षये॥<br />Similarly in scriptures in which the many Souls are said to have one origin in the Supreme Soul, it may be said that this entire universe is at one with that one Soul of superior attributes. I shall explain this now, after bowing to my preceptor Vyasa, that foremost of Rishis, who is conversant with the soul, endued with penances, self-controlled, and worthy of respectful adoration.</p>
<p id='4'>इदं पुरुषसूक्तं हि सर्ववेदेषु पार्थिव। ऋतं सत्यं च विख्यातमृषिसिंहेन चिन्तितम्॥<br />This speculation on Purusha, O king, occurs in all the Vedas. It is well-known to be at one with Rita and Truth. The foremost of Rishis, viz., Vyasa, has thought upon it.</p>
<p id='5'>उत्सर्गेणापवादेन ऋषिभिः कपिलादिभिः। अध्यात्मचिन्तामाश्रित्य शास्त्रााण्युक्तानि भारत॥<br />Having occupied themselves with reflection on what is called the spiritual science, various Rishis, O king, having Kapila for their first, have declared their opinions on this subject both generally and particularly.</p>
<p id='6'>समासतस्तु यद् व्यासः पुरुषैकत्वमुक्तवान्। तत् तेऽहं सम्प्रवक्ष्यामि प्रसादादमितौजसः॥<br />Through the favour of Vyasa of great energy, I shall explain to you what Vyasa has said in brief on this question of the Oneness of Soul.</p>
<p id='7'>अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। ब्रह्मणा सह संवादं त्र्यम्बकस्य विशाम्पते॥<br />Regarding it is cited the old discourse between Brahman, O king, and the Three-eyed Mahadeva.</p>
<p id='8'>क्षीरोदस्य समुद्रस्य मध्ये हाटकसप्रभः। वैजयन्त इति ख्यातः पर्वतप्रवरो नृप॥<br />In the midst of the Ocean of milk, there is a very huge mountain of great effulgence like that of gold, known, O king, by the name of Vaijayanta.</p>
<p id='9'>तत्राध्यात्मगति देव एकाकी प्रविचिन्तयन्। वैराजसदनान्नित्यं वैजयन्तं निषेवते॥<br />Going there all alone, from his own abode of great splendour and happiness, the illustrious god Brahman used very often to pass his time, engaged in thinking on the course of spiritual science.</p>
<p id='10'>अथ तत्रासतस्तस्य चतुर्वक्त्रस्य धीमत। ललाटप्रभवः पुत्रः शिव आगाद् यदृच्छया॥<br />While the four-headed Brahman of great intelligence, as seated there, his son Mahadeva, who had originated from his forehead, met him one day in course of his travel through the universe.</p>
<p id='11'>आकाशेन महायोगी पुरा त्रिनयनः प्रभुः। ततः खानिपपाताशु धरणीधरमूर्धनि॥<br />In days of yore, the Three-eyed Shiva endued with power and high Yoga, while proceeding along the sky, saw Brahman seated on that mountain and, therefore, dropped down quickly on its top.</p>
<p id='12'>अग्रतश्चाभवत् प्रीतो ववन्दे चापि पादयोः। तं पादयोर्निपतितं दृष्ट्वा सव्येन पाणिना॥<br />With a cheerful heart he appeared before his progenitor and adored his feet. Seeing Mahadeva prostrated at his feet, Brahman took him up with his left hand.</p>
<p id='13'>उत्थापयामास तदा प्रभुरेकः प्रजापतिः। उवाच चैनं भगवांश्चिरस्यागतमात्मजम्॥<br />Having thus raised Mahadeva up, Brahman, that powerful and one Lord of all creatures, then addressed his son, whom he met after long time in those words.</p>
<p id='14'>पितामह उवाच स्वागतं ते महाबाहो दिष्ट्या प्राप्तोऽसि मेऽन्तिकम्। कच्चित् ते कुशलं पुत्र स्वाध्यायतपसोः सदा॥ नित्यमुग्रतपास्त्वं हि ततः पृच्छामि ते पुनः॥<br />The Grandfather said Welcome are you, O you of mighty arms! By good luck I see you after such a long time before me. I hope, O son, that everything is right with your penances, and your Vedic studies and recitations. You always observe the austerest penances. hence I ask you about the progress and well-being of those penances of yours.</p>
<p id='15'>रुद्र उवाच त्वत्प्रसादेन भगवन् स्वाध्यायतपसोर्मम। कुशलं चाव्ययं चैव सर्वस्य जगतस्त्वथ॥<br />Rudra said O Illustrious One, through your grace, all is well with my penances and Vedic studies. It is all right, again, with universe.</p>
<p id='16'>चिरदृष्टो हि भगवान् वैराजसदने मया। ततोऽहं पर्वतं प्राप्तस्त्विमं त्वत्पादसेवितम्॥<br />I saw your illustrious self a long while ago in your own home of happiness and effulgence! I am coming thence to this mountain that is not the habitation of your feet.</p>
<p id='17'>कौतूहलं चापि हि मे एकान्तगमनेन ते। नैतत् कारणमल्पं हि भविष्यति पितामह॥<br />My mind is filled up with great curiosity for your thus coming into such a secluded mind from your usual religion of happiness and splendour. There must be great reason, O Grandfather, for such an act.</p>
<p id='18'>किं नु तत्सदनं श्रेष्ठं क्षुत्पिपासाविवर्जितम्। सुरासुरैरध्युषितं ऋषिभिश्चरामितप्रभैः॥ गन्धर्वैरप्सरोभिश्च सततं संनिषेवितम्। उत्सृज्येम गिरिवरमेकाकी प्राप्तवानसि॥<br />Your own foremost of abodes is free from the pains of hunger and thirst and inhabited by both gods and Asuras, by Rishis of great splendour, as also by Gandharvas and Apsaras. Leaving such a spot of happiness, you live alone in this foremost of mountains. The cause of this cannot but be weighty.</p>
<p id='19'>ब्रह्मोवाच वैजयन्तो गिरिवरः सततं सेव्यते मया। अत्रैकाग्रेण मनसा पुरुषश्चिन्त्यते विराट्॥<br />This foremost of mountains, called Vaijayanta, is always my abode. Here, with concentrated mind, I meditate on the one universal Soul of infinite proportions.</p>
<p id='20'>रुद्र उवाच वहवः पुरुषा ब्रह्मंस्त्वया सृष्टाः स्वयम्भुवा। सृज्यन्ते चापरे ब्रह्मन् स चैकः पुरुषो विराट॥<br />Rudra said Self-create you are. Many are the Souls that haven been created by you. Others again, O Brahman, are being created by you. The Infinite Soul, however, of whom you speak, is one and single.</p>
<p id='21'>को ह्यसौ चिन्त्यते ब्रह्मस्त्वयैकः पुरुषोत्तमः। एतन्मे संशयं ब्रूहि महत् कौतूहलं हि मे॥<br />Who is that foremost of Souls, O Brahman, that is being meditated by you? Great is my curiosity about it. Do you kindly remove the doubt that has possessed my mind!</p>
<p id='22'>ब्रह्मोवाच बहवः पुरुषाः पुत्र त्वया ये समुदाहृताः। एवमेतदतिक्रान्तं द्रष्टव्यं नैवमित्यपि॥<br />Brahman said O son, many are those Souls of whom you speak. The one Soul, however, of whom I am thinking, transcends all Souls and is invisible.</p>
<p id='23'>आधारं तु प्रवक्ष्यामि एकस्य पुरुषस्य ते। बहूनां पुरुषाणां स यथैका योनिरुच्यते॥ तथा तं पुरुषं विश्वं परमं सुमहत्तमम्। निर्गुणं निर्गुणा भूत्वा प्रविशन्ति सनातनम्॥<br />The many Souls that exist in the universe constitute the basis upon which that one Soul slands; and since that one Soul is said to be the source whence all the innumerable Purushas have originated, hence all the latter, if they succeed in divesting themselves of attributes, become competent to enter into that one Soul who is at one with the universe, who is supreme, who is the foremost of the foremost, who is eternal, and who is himself divested of and is above all qualities. 77977 Ryt fagd TH</p>
<p id='24'>सुमहत्तमम्। निर्गुणं निर्गुणा भूत्वा प्रविशन्ति सनातनम्॥<br />The many Souls that exist in the universe constitute the basis upon which that one Soul slands; and since that one Soul is said to be the source whence all the innumerable Purushas have originated, hence all the latter, if they succeed in divesting themselves of attributes, become competent to enter into that one Soul who is at one with the universe, who is supreme, who is the foremost of the foremost, who is eternal, and who is himself divested of and is above all qualities.</p>
