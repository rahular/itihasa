<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 342</h3><h4>The attainment of uniformity by Agni and Soma-the birth of gods, Manus etc.</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>अर्जुन उवाच अग्नीषोमौ कथं पूर्वमेकयोनी प्रवर्तितौ। एष मे संशयो जातस्तं छिन्धि मधुसूदन॥<br />How did Agni and Soma, in days of yore, attain to uniformity with regard to their original nature? Thus doubt has arisen in my mind. Do you remove it, O slayer of Madhu.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>श्रीभगवानुवाच हन्त ते वर्तयिष्यामि पुराणं पाण्डुनन्दन। आत्मतेजोद्भवं पार्थ शृणुष्वैकमना मम॥<br />I shall recite to you, O son of Pandu, an ancient story of events arising from my own energy. Do you listen to it with concentrated mind.</p>

The Manifest disappear into the Unmanifest. All creatures, mobile and immobile, meet with destruction. Fire, Earth, Wind, all disappear. Darkness covers the universe which becomes one endless expanse of water.</p>

Neither aught nor naught exists; neither manifest nor unmanifest.</p>

There is authority for this assertion.</p>

Aught was not. Naught was not. In the beginning there was only Ignorance. She was of the form of the universe, and she is the night of Narayana of universal form. This is the meaning of the word of Tamas.</p>

Brahman, wishing to create creatures caused Agni and Soma to originate from his own own eyes. Afterwards when creatures were to be created, the ceated persons came out in their due order as Brahmanas and Kshatriyas. He who came into being as Soma was none else than Brahma; and they that were born as Brahmanas were all Soma in sooth. He who came into Being as Agni was none else than Kshatriya. The Brahmanas became gifted with greater energy than the Kshatriyas. If you enquire about the reason thereof, the answer is that this superiority of the Brahmanas to the Kshatriyas is an attribute which is manifest to the whole world. It occurred as follows. The Brahmanas represent the eldest creation amonst men. None were created before who were superior to the Brahmanas. He who offers food into the mouth of a Brahmana is considered as pouring libations into a burning fire. I say that having arranged things thus, the creation of creatures was accomplished by Brahman. Having established all created beings in their respective positions, he keeps us the three worlds. There is a similar declaration in the Mantras of the Shrutis.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>त्वमग्ने यज्ञानां होता विश्वेषां हितो देवानां मानुषाणां च जगत इति॥<br />You, O Agni, are the Hota in sacrifices, and the benefactor of the universe. You are the benefactor of the gods, of men and of all the worlds.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>निदर्शनं एचात्र भवति विश्वेषामग्ने यज्ञानां त्वं होतेति। त्वं हितो देवैर्मनुष्यैर्जगत इति॥<br />There is other authority also for this You are, O Agni, the Hotri of the universe and of sacrifices. You are the instrument through which the gods and men do good to the universe.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>अग्निहि यज्ञानां होता कर्ता स चाग्निब्रह्म॥ न हते मन्त्राणां हवनमस्ति न विना पुरुषं तपः सम्भवति। हविर्मन्त्राणां सम्पूजा विद्यते देवमानुषऋषीणामनेन त्वं होतेति नियुक्तः। ये च मानुषहोत्राधिकारास्ते च ब्राह्मणस्य हि याजनं विधीयते न क्षत्रवैश्ययोईिजात्योस्तस्माद् ब्राह्मणा ह्यग्निभूता यज्ञानुद्वहन्ति। यज्ञास्ते देवांस्तपर्यन्ति पृथिवीं भावयन्ति शतपथेऽपि हि ब्राह्मणमुखे भवति॥<br />Agni is truly the Hotri and the performer of sacrifices. Agni is again the Brahma of the sacrifice. No libations can be poured into the sacrificial fire without uttering Mantras; there can be no penances without a person to perform them; the worship of the gods and men and the Rishis is done by the libations poured with Mantras. Hence, O Agni, you have been considered as the Hotri in sacrifices. You are, again, all the other Mantras that have been declared with regard to the Homa rites of men. The duty of the Brahmanas is to officiate for others in the sacrifices they perform. The two other castes viz., Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, that are included within the twice-born class, have not the same duty, laid down for them. Hence, Brahmanas are like Agni, who uphold sacrifices. The sacrifices strengthen the gods. Thus, strengthened the gods fructify the Earth. But the result that may be gained by the foremost of sacrifices may as well be done through the mouth of the Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>देवाः अग्नौ समिद्धे स जुहोति यो विद्वान् ब्राह्मणमुखेनाहुति जुहोति॥<br />That learned man who offers food into the mouth of a Brahmana is said to pour libations into the sacred fire for pleasing the gods.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>एवमप्यग्निभूता ब्राह्मणा विद्वांसोऽग्नि भावयन्ति। अग्निर्विष्णुः सर्वभूतान्यनुप्रविश्य प्राणान् धारयति॥<br />In this way the Brahmanas have come to be considered as Agni. They who are endued with learning worship Agni. Agni is, again, Vishnu. Entering all creatures, he upholds their vital airs.</p>

Brahman, in creating the universe, first created the Brahmanas. The Brahmanas become immortal by studying the Vedas, and go to heaven by virtue of such study. The intelligence, speech, acts and observances, faith, and the penances of the Brahmanas keep up both the Earth and the heaven like slings of strings upholding bovine nectar.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>नास्ति सत्यात् परो धर्मो नास्ति मातृसमो गुरुः। ब्राह्मणेभ्यः परं नास्ति प्रेत्य चेह च भूतये॥<br />There is no duty higher than Truth. There is no one more worthy of respect than the mother. There is none more efficient than the Brahmana for conferring happiness both in this world and the next.</p>

There the no oxen do not carry the people or draw the plough, nor do cars of any kind bear them. There milk kept in jars is never churned for producing butter. On the other hand, the dwellers become shorn of every prosperity, and follow the ways of robbers.</p>

are the souls of all creatures, who are the creators of all things, and who are at one with all existent objects, originated from the mouth of Narayana. Indeed, it is said that the Brahmanas first issued of that great boongiving gods mouth when he had controlled his speech as a penance. The Brahmanas are distinguished above the gods and Asuras, since they created by myself in my indescribable form as Brahma as I have created the gods and the Asuras and the great Rishis and placed them in their respective situations and have to punish them occasionally. On account of his amorous assault on Ahalya, Indra was cursed by Gautama, her husband, through which Indra got a green beard on his face. Through that curse of Kaushika, Indra lost also, his own testicles which loss was afterwards compensated by the substitution of the testicles of a ram. When in the sacrifice of king Sarjjati, the great Rishi Chyavana wanted to make the twin Ashvins sharers of the were sacrificial offerings, Indra objected. Upon Chyavanas insisting, Indra tried to hurl his thunderbolt at him. The Rishi paralysed Indras arms. Enraged at the destruction of his sacrifice by Rudra, the great Rishi Daksha once more began to practise severe austerities, and attaining to high power caused something like a third eye to appear on the forehead of Rudra. When Rudra became ready for the destruction of the triple city belonging to the Asuras, the preceptor of the Asuras, viz., Ushanas, provoked beyond patience, tore a matted lock from his own head and hurled it at Rudra. From that matted lock of Ushanas originated many serpents. Those serpents began to bite Rudra, at which his throat became blue. During a period, long gone by, at the time of the selfborn Manu, it is said that Narayana had seized Rudra by the throat and hence did Rudras throat become blue. On the occasion of churning the Ocean for ambrosia, Brihaspati of Angiras's family sat on the shores of the Ocean for performing the rite of Puruscharana. When he took up a little water for the purpose of the initial rinsing, the water seemed to him to be very muddy. At this Brihaspati became angry and cursed the Ocean, saying,-Since you continue to be so dirty without caring for the fact of my having come to touch you, since you have not become clear and transparent, therefore from this day you shall be tainted with fishes and sharks and tortoises and other aquatic animals! From that time, the waters of the ocean have become filled with various sorts of sea-animals and monsters. Vishvarupa, the son of Tashtri, formerly, became the priest of the gods. He was, on his mothers side, connected with the Asuras, for his mother was the daughter of an Asura. While publicly offering to the gods their shares of sacrificial offerings, he privately offered shares thereof to the Asuras. The Asuras, headed by their king Hiranyakashipu, then went to their sister, the mother of Vishvarupa, and begged a boon from her, saying,-Your son Vishvarupa by Tashtri, otherwise called Trishiras, is now the priest of the gods. While he gives to the gods their shares of sacrificial offerings publicly, he gives us our shares of the same privately. On account of this, the gods are being advanced and we are being weakened. You should, therefore, curse. influence him that he may take up our cause! Thus addressed by them, the mother of Vishvarupa went to her son who was then living in the Nandana forest (of Indra) and said to him,-How is it, son, that you are engaged in advancing the interests of your enemies and weakening that of your maternal uncles? You should not act in this way. Thus begged by his mother, Vishvarupa thought that he should not disobey her words, and as the result of that thought he went over to the side of Hiranyakashipu, after having paid proper respects to his mother. Upon the arrival of Trishiras, king Hiranyakashipu dismissed his old Priest, viz., Vashishtha the son of Brahman, and appointed Trishiras to that office. Enraged at this, Vashishtha cursed Hiranyakashipu, saying,-Since you dismiss me and appoint another person, as your Priest, this Sacrifice of yours shall not be completed, and some being, the like of whom has not existed before, will kill you! On account of this Hiranyakashipu was killed by Vishnu in the form of a man-lion. Vishvarupa, having taken up the side of his maternal relations, began to practise severe austerities for advancing them. Moved by the desire of making him swerve from his vows, Indra sent, to handsome Apsaras. Seeing those celestialnymphs of transcendent beauty, the heart of Vishvarupa became moved. Within a very short time he became greatly attached to them, the celestial nymphs said to him one day,-We shall not tarry here any longer. In fact, we shall return to that place whence we came! The son of Tashtri replied,-Where will you go? Stay with me. I shall do you good! Hearing him say so, the Apsaras rejoined, We are celestial nymphs called Apsaras. We chose in days of old the illustrious and boongiving Indra of great power!-Vishvarupa then said to them, This very day I shall so ordain that all the gods with Indra at their head shall cease to be!-Saying this, Trishiras began to recite mentally certain sacred Mantras of great efficacy. By virtue of those Mantras he began to increase in energy. With one of his mouths he began to drink all the Soma that Brahmanas devoted Sacrifices poured on their sacred fires with due rites. With a second mouth he began to eat all the food. With his him many third mouth he began to drink up the energy of all the gods headed by Indra. Seeing him swelling with energy in every part of his body that was strengthened by the Soma he was drinking, all the gods then, with Indra in their company, went to the Grandfather Brahman. Arrived at his presence, they addressed him and said, — All the Soma that is duly offered in the sacrifices celebrated everywhere is being drunk by Vishvarupa. We no longer get our shares. The Asuras are being advanced, while we are being weakened! You should, therefore, ordain what is for our behoof! After the gods ceased, the Grandfather replied, — The great Rishi Dadhichi of Bhrigu's race is now engaged in practising severe austerities. Go, ye gods, to him and solicit a boon from him. Do ye so arrange that he may renounce his body! With is bones let a new weapon be made called the Thunder-bolt!-Thus instructed by the Grandfather, the gods proceeded to that place where the holy Rishi Dadhichi was practising austerities. The gods, headed by Indra, addressed the sage, saying.-O Holy One, your austerities, we trust, are being well performed and uninterrupted !-The sage Dadhichi said,-Welcome to all of you! Tell me what I should do for you! I shall certainly do what you will say!-They then told him,You should renounce your body for benefiting all the worlds!—Thus prayed, the sage Dadhichi, who was a great Yogin and who considered happiness and misery equally, without being at all dispirited, concentrated his Soul by his Yoga power and renounced his body. When his Soul left its temporary tenement of clay, Dhatri, taking his bones, created a dreadful weapon called the Thunderbolt. With the Thunder-bolt thus created of the bones of a Brahmana, which was impenetrable by other weapons and irresistible and permeated by the energy of Vishnu, Indra struck Vishvarupa the son of Tashtri. Having killed the son of Tashtri thus, Indra cut off the head from the body. From the lifeless body, however, of Vishvarupa, when it was pressed, the energy that was still living in it gave birth to a powerful Asura named Vritra. Vritra became the enemy of Indra, but Indra killed him also with the Thunder-bolt. On account of the sin being thus doubled of Brahmanicide, Indra became stricken with a great fear and as the consequence thereof he had to relinquish the sovereignty of heaven. He entered a cool lotus-stalk that grew in the Manasa lake. On account of the Yoga power of lightness, he became very minute and entered the fibres of that lotus-stalk. When the king of the three worlds, the husband of Shachi, had thus disappeared from sight through fear of the sin of Brahmanicide, the universe became kingless The qualities of Darkness and Ignorance attacked the gods. The Mantras uttered by the great Rishis lost all efficacy. Rakshasas appeared on all sides. The Vedas were about to disappear. The denizens of all the worlds, having no king, lost their strength and began to fall an easy prey to Rakshasas and other evil Beings. Then the gods and the Rishis, in a body, made Nahusha, the son of Ayush, the king of the three worlds and duly crowned him as such. Nahusha had on his forehead full fivehundred luminaries of great effulgence, which had the virtue of defeating every creature of energy. Thus equipt Nahusha continued to govern heaven. The three worlds were restored to their normal state. The inhabitants of the universe more became happy and cheerful. Nahusha then said,-Everything that Indra used to enjoy is before me. Only, his wife Shachi is not by!-Having said this, Nahusha proceeded to where Shachi and, addressing her said,-blessed lady, I have become the king of the gods! Do you accept me!-Shachi replied, saying,-You are by nature, of a pious conduct. You belong, again, to the race of Soma. You should not attack another person's wife!-Nahusha, thus addressed by her, said,-I now occupy the position of Indra, I deserve to enjoy the dominions and all the precious possession of Indra. There is no sin in wishing to enjoy you. You were Indra's and, therefore, should be mine!-Shachi then said to him, I am observing a vow that has not yet been finished. After performing the final ablutions I shall come to you within a few days! Taking this promise from Indra's wife, Nahusha left her. Meanwhile Shachi, stricken with pain and grief, anxious to find her lord and assailed by her fear of Nahusha, went to Brihaspati. At the first sight Brihaspati took her to be stricken once was with anxiety. He immediately took to Yogameditation and learnt that she was intent upon doing what was necessary for restoring her husband to his true position. Brihaspati then addressed her, saying,-Equipt with penances and the merit that will be yours on account of this vow that you are observing, do you invoke the boon-giving goddess Upashruti! Invoked by you, she will appear and show you where your husband is living!—While observing that very austere vow, she invoked with the help of proper Mantras the boon-giving goddess Upashruti. Invoked by Shachi, the goddess appeared before her and said, I am here at your command! Invoked by you, I have come! What wish of yours shall I satisfy.-Bowing to her with the head down, Shachi-blessed lady, you should show me where my husband is! You are Truth! You are Rita! Thus addressed, the goddess Upashruti took her to the lake Manasa. Arrived there, she pointed out to Shachi her lord Indra living within the fibres of a lotus-stalk. Seeing his wife pale and emaciated, Indra became highly anxious. And the king of heaven said to himself,-Alas, great is the sorrow that has befallen me! I have fallen off from the position that is mine! This my wife, stricken with grief on my account, finds out my lost self and comes to me here! Having thought thus, Indra addressed his dear wife and said, In what condition are you now?-She answered him,-Nahusha asks me to become his wife. I have obtained leave from him, having fixed the time when I am to go to him! Indra then said to her,-Go and say to Nahusha that he should come to you on a car never used before, viz., one to which some Rishis should be yoked, and arriving at yours in that state he should marry you! Indra has many beautiful and charming vehicles. All these have borne you. Nahusha, however, should come on such a vehicle that Indra himself had never used!

Filled with jealousy, the rest of his wives, leaving him, went to their husband, saying,-O holy one, although all of us are equal in beauty, yet our husband Soma is wholly attached to our sister Rohini!-Enraged at this representation of his daughters, the celestial Rishi Daksha cursed Soma, saying, that thenceforth the disease phthisis should attach his son-in-law and live in him. Through this curse of Daksha, phthisis attacked the powerful Soma and entered into his person. Attacked by phthisis thus Soma came to Daksha. The latter addressed him, saying,-1 have cursed you because of your unequal conduct towards your wives. The Rishi then said unto Soma,—You are being reduced by the disease phthisis that has attacked you. There is a sacred water called Hiranyasarah in the Western ocean. Going to that sacred water, do you bathe there!-Advised by the Rishi, Soma went there. Arrived at Hiranyasarah, Soma bathed in that sacred water. Performing his oblation, he purged himself off of the sin. And because that sacred water saw illumined (abhasita) by Soma, therefore was it from that day called by the name of Prabhasa. On account, however, of the curse imprecated upon him in day of yore by Daksha, Soma, to this day, begins to decrease from the night of the full moon till his total disappearance on the night of the new moon whence he once more begins to increase till the night of full moon. The brightness also of the lunar disc from that time got a stain, for the body of Soma, since then, has come to show certain black spots.
