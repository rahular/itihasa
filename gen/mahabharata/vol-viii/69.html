<h3>None: Chapter 242</h3><h4>The same subject</h4><p id='1'>शुक उवाच क्षरात्प्रभृति यः सर्गः सगुणानीन्द्रियाणि च। बुद्ध्यैश्वर्यातिसर्गोऽयं प्रधानश्चात्मनः श्रुतम्॥<br />Shuka said I have now understood that there are two kinds of creation, viz., one universal emanating from the (universal) Soul. The other consisting of the senses with their objects, originates from the power of the Understanding. This last transcends the other and is considered to be the foremost.</p>
<p id='2'>भूय एव तु लोकेऽस्मिन् सवृत्तिं कालहैतुकीम्। यया सन्तः प्रवर्तन्ते तदिच्छाम्यनुवर्तितुम्॥<br />I wish however, to once more hear of that path of righteousness which runs in this world, regulated by the virtue of Time and according to which all good men form their conduct.</p>
<p id='3'>वेदे वचनमुक्तं तु कुरु कर्म त्यजेति च। कथमेतद् विजानीयां तच्च व्याख्यातुमर्हसि॥<br />In the Vedas there are both kinds of saying, do acts and avoid acts. How shall I succeed in determining which of the two is right? You should explain this clearly.</p>

<p id='6'>ब्रह्मचर्येण वै लोकान् जयन्ति परमर्षयः। आत्मनश्च ततः श्रेयांस्यन्विच्छन् मनसाऽऽत्मनि॥ वने मूलफलाशी च तप्यन् सुविपुलं तपः। पुण्यायतनचारी च भूतानामविहिंसकः॥ विधूमे सन्नमुसले वानप्रस्थप्रतिश्रये। काले प्राप्ते चरन् भैक्ष्यं कल्पते ब्रह्मभूयसे॥<br />The great Rishis conquer all the worlds by the practice of celebacy. Seeking all things which are good for himself, by fixing the mind the understanding, practising austerities, by living in forest and lying on fruits and roots, by treading on sacred spots, by practising universal benevolence, and by begging alms at the proper time from the huts of herinits when these become smokeless and the sound of the husking rod is hushed a person attains to Brahma.</p>

Whether on severe ! this is authoritative or that is so, when there is this conflict, how can they be considered to be spiritual.</p>
