<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 356</h3><h4>The story of the Naga king Padma</h4><p id='1'>ब्राह्मण उवाच अतिभारोऽथ तस्यैव भारावतरणं महत्। पराश्वासकरं वाक्यमिदं मे भवतः श्रुतम्॥<br />I have heard these words of yours that are so consoling, with as much satisfaction as is experienced by a person heavily loaded when that load is taken off his head or shoulders.</p>
<p id='2'>अध्वक्लान्तस्य शयनं स्थानक्लान्तस्य चासनम्। तृषितस्य च पानीयं क्षुधार्तस्य च भोजनम्॥ ईप्सितस्येव सम्प्राप्तिरन्नस्य समयेऽतिथेः। एषितस्यात्मनः काले वृद्धस्यैव सुतो यथा॥ मनसा चिन्तितस्येव प्रीतिस्निग्धस्य दर्शनम्। प्रह्लादयति मां वाक्यं भवता यदुदीरितम्॥ दत्तचक्षुरिवाकाशे पश्यामि विमृशामि च।<br />The pleasure which a traveller who has made a long journey on foot feels when he lies down on a bed, that which a person feels when he finds a seat after having stood for a long time for want of room, or that which is felt by a thirsty person when he finds a glass of cool water, or that which is felt by a hungry man when he finds good food set before him, or that which a guest feels when a dish of desirable food is placed before him at the proper time, or that which is felt by an old men when after long coveting he gets a son, or that which is felt by one when meeting with a dear friend or relative about whom he had become highly anxious, resembles that which I have been filled on account of these words given vent to by you.</p>
<p id='3'>प्रज्ञानवचनाद्योऽयमुपदेशो हि मे कृतः॥ बाढमेवं करिष्यामि यथा मे भाषते भवान्।<br />Like a person with upturned look I have heard what has fallen from your lips and am thinking upon their meaning. With these wise words of yours, you have truly instructed me!</p>
<p id='4'>इमां हि रजनीं साधो निवसस्व मया सह॥ प्रभाते यास्यति भवान् पर्याश्वस्तः सुखोषितः। असौ हि भगवान् सूर्यो मन्दरश्मिरवाङ्मुखः॥<br />Yes, I shall do what you have ordered me to do. You may go tomorrow carily in the morning, passing the night happily with me and removing your fatigue by such rest. See, the rays of the divine Sun have been partially dimmed and the god of day is going in his downward course!</p>
<p id='5'>भीष्म उवाच ततस्तेन कृतातिथ्यः सोऽतिथिः शत्रुसूदन। उवास किल तां रात्रिं सह तेन द्विजेन वै॥<br />Bhishma continued Hospitably treated by that Brahmana, the learned guest, O destroyer of enemies, passed that night in the company of his host.</p>
<p id='6'>चतुर्थधर्मसंयुक्तं तयोः कथयतोस्तदा। व्यतीता सा निशा कृत्स्ना सुखेन दिवसोपमा॥<br />Indeed, both of them passed the night happily, conversing cheerfully with each other on the subject of the duties of the fourth mode of life, viz., Sannyasa. So engrossing was their conversation that the night passed away as if it were day.</p>
<p id='7'>ततः प्रभातसमये सोऽतिथिस्तेन पूजितः। ब्राह्मणेन यथाशक्त्य स्वकार्यमभिकाङ्क्षता॥<br />When morning came, the guest was adored with due rites by the Brahmana, who was bent upon doing what was considered by him to be beneficial for himself.</p>
<p id='8'>ततः स विप्रः कृतकर्मनिश्चयः कृताभ्यनुज्ञः स्वजनेन धर्मकृत्। यथोपदिष्टं भुजगेन्द्रसंश्रयं जगाम काले सुकृतैकनिश्चयः॥<br />Having dismissed his guest, the virtuous Brahmana, determined to achieve his purpose, took leave of his kinsmen and relatives, and started in due time for the abode of that foremost of Nagas, with heart firmly directed towards it.</p>
