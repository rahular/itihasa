<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 354</h3><h4>Householders' duties</h4><p id='1'>ब्राह्मण उवाच समुत्पन्नाभिधानोऽस्मि वाङ्माधुर्येण तेऽनघ। मित्रत्वमभिपन्नस्त्वं किंचिद् वक्ष्याम तच्छृणु॥<br />The Brahmana said Osinless One, I have become greatly attached to you on account of the sweetness of your conversation.
