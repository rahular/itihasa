I shall now describe to you the ordinances about penances. Hear me as I describe that subject.</p>

<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>एवं तस्य प्रवृत्तस्य नित्यमेवानुपश्यतः। रागद्वेषौ विवर्धेते ह्यनित्यत्वमपश्यतः॥<br />One who follows this mode of life continually casts his eye upon these objects. Under these circumstances, one's attachments and aversions multiply, and one ceases to consider unreal possessions as eternal and indestructible.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>रागद्वेषाभिभूतं च नरं द्रव्यवशानुगम्। मोहजाता रतिर्नाम समुपैति नराधिप॥<br />When a person becomes possessed by attachment and aversion, and gives way to the control of worldly objects, the desire of enjoyment then seizes him, originating from carelessness, O king.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>कृतार्थं भोगिनं मत्वा सर्वो रतिपरायणः। लाभं ग्राम्यसुखादन्यं रतितो नानुपश्यति॥<br />Considering that person as blessed who has the largest share of enjoyments in this world, the man devoted to enjoyment does not, on account of his attachment thereto, see that there is any other happiness save what depends upon the gratification of the senses.</p>

At last he meets with destruction as the inevitable result of the conduct he follows.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>तथा हि बुद्धियुक्तानां शाश्वतं ब्रह्मवादिनाम्। अन्विच्छतां शुभं कर्म नराणां त्यजतां सुखम्॥<br />It is well known, however, that true happiness is theirs who are endued with intelligence, who are Brahmavadins, who try to perform only auspicious and beneficial acts, and who abstain from all acts which are optional and originate from desire only.</p>

The senses being stupefied, one's wisdom is lost like knowledge not kept up by continued application.</p>
