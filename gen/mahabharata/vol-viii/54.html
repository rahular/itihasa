<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 227</h3><h4>What is the good for a man who is the distress for loss of friends of kingdom</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच मग्नस्य व्यसने कृच्छ्रे किं श्रेयः पुरुषस्य हि। बन्धुनाशे महीपाल राज्यनाशेऽथवा पुनः॥<br />Yudhisthira said What, indeed, is good for a man who is sunk in dire distress, consequent on the loss of friends or kingdom, O king.</p>
<p id='2'>त्वं हि नः परमो वक्ता लोकेऽस्मिन् भरतर्षभ। एतद् भवन्तं पृच्छामि तन्मे तवं वक्तुमर्हसि॥<br />In this world, O foremost of Bharata's race, you are the greatest of our instructors! I ask you this. You should tell me what I ask."</p>
<p id='3'>भीष्म उवाच पुत्रदारैः सुखैश्चैव वियुक्तस्य धनेन वा। मग्नस्य व्यसने कृच्छ्रे धृतिः श्रेयस्करी नृप॥ धैर्येण युक्तस्य सत: शरीरं न विशीर्यते।<br />'Fortitude is of the greatest good, O king, for one who has been deprived of sons and wives and pleasures of every sort and wealth, and who has been plunged into dire distress. The body is never emaciated of one who is always endued with fortitude.</p>
<p id='4'>विशोकता सुखं धत्ते धत्ते चारोग्यमुत्तमम्॥ आरोग्याच्च शरीरस्य स पुनर्विन्दते श्रियम्।<br />Want of sorrow carries happiness with it, and also health which is a superior possession. Again, on account of this health, one may acquire prosperity.</p>
<p id='5'>यच्च प्राज्ञो नरस्तात सात्त्विकी वृत्तिमास्थितः॥ तस्यैश्वर्यं च धैर्यं च व्यवसायश्च कर्मसु।<br />That wise man, O sire, who always follows righteous conduct succeeds in acquiring prosperity, patience, and perseverance in the accomplishment of all his objects.</p>
<p id='6'>अत्रैवोदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्॥ बलिवासवसंवादं पुनरेव युधिष्ठिर।<br />Regarding it is cited the old discourse between Vali and Vasava,OYudhisthira.</p>
<p id='7'>वृत्ते देवासुरे युद्धे दैत्यदानवसंक्षये॥ विष्णुक्रान्तेषु लोकेषु देवराजे शतक्रतो।<br />After the battle between the gods and the demons in which a large number of Daityas and Danavas fell, had come to a close, Vali became king. He was deceived by Vishnu who once more established his supremacy over all the worlds. The god of a hundred sacrifices was once more invested with the sovereignty of the celestials.</p>
<p id='8'>इज्यमानेषु देवेषु चातुर्वर्ण्य व्यवस्थिते॥ समृद्धमात्रे त्रैलोक्ये प्रीतियुक्ते स्वयम्भुवि।<br />After the celestial adininistration had thus been re-established, and the four orders of men had been re-established in performance of their respective duties, the three worlds once inore swelled with prosperty, and the Self-create . became glad of heart.</p>
<p id='9'>रुद्रैर्वसुभिरादित्यैरश्विभ्यामपि चर्षिभिः॥ गन्धर्वैर्भुजगेन्दैश्च सिद्धैश्चान्यैर्वृतः प्रभुः। चतुर्दन्तं सुदान्तं च वारणेन्द्रं श्रिया वृतम्। आरुरािवतं शक्रस्त्रैलोक्यमनुसंययौ॥<br />At that time, accompanied by the Rudras, the Vasus, the Adityas, the Ashvins, the celestial Rishis, the Gandharvas, the Siddhas, and other superior orders of beings, the powerful Shakra seated on his four-tusked prince of elephants, called Airavata, marched through all the worlds.</p>
<p id='10'>स कदाचित् समुद्रान्ते कस्मिश्चिद् गिरिगह्वरे। बलिं वैरोचनि वज्री ददर्शोपससर्य च॥<br />One day, while thus engaged, the holder of the thunderbolt was Virochana's son Vali within a certain mountain cave on the seashore. Seeing the king of Danavas, he came near him.</p>
<p id='11'>तमैरावतमूर्धस्थं प्रेक्ष्य देवगणैर्वृतम्। सुरेन्द्रमिन्द्रं दैत्येन्द्रो न शुशोच न विव्यथे॥<br />Seeing the king of gods, viz., Indra, thus seated on the back of Airavata and surrounded by the several orders of the celestials, the king of the Daityas displayed no signs of sorrow or agitation.</p>
<p id='12'>दृष्ट्वा तमविकारस्थं तिष्ठन्तं निर्भयं बलिम्। अधिरूढो द्विपश्रेष्ठमित्युवाच शतक्रतुः॥<br />Seeing Vali unmoved and fearless, Indra also addressed him from the back of his king of elephants, saying,-</p>
<p id='13'>दैत्य न व्यथसे शौर्यादथवा वृद्धसेवया। तपसा भावितत्वाद् वा सर्वथैतत् सुदुष्करम्॥<br />How is it, O Daitya, that you are so unmoved? Is it owning to your heroism or to your having waited reverentially upon elders? Is it owning to your mind having been purified by penances? To whatever cause it may be due, this mood of mind is surely very difficult to attain.</p>
<p id='14'>शत्रुभिर्वशमानीतो हीनः स्थानादनुत्तमात्। वैरोचने किमाश्रित्य शोचितव्ये न शोचसि॥<br />Hurled from the highest position, you are now shorn of all your possessions and have been brought under the sway of your enemies. O Virochana's son what is that by adopting which you to do not grieve although it is time for grief.</p>
<p id='15'>श्रैष्ठ्यं प्राप्य स्वजातीनां महाभोगाननुत्तमान्। हतस्वरत्नराज्यस्त्वं ब्रूहि कस्मान्न शोचसि॥<br />Formerly, when you were the king of your own order, you enjoyed matchless pleasures. Now, however, you are shorn of your riches and jewels and sovereignty. Tell us why you arc so unmoved.</p>
<p id='16'>ईश्वरो हि पुरा भूत्वा पितृपैतामहे पदे। तत्त्वमद्य हृतं दृष्ट्वा सपत्नैः किं न शोचसि॥<br />You were ere this a god, seated on the throne of your father and grandfathers. Finding yourself deprived to-day by your enemies, why do you not grieve?</p>
<p id='17'>बद्धश्च वारुणैः पाशैर्वज्रेण च समाहतः। हतदारो हृतधनो ब्रूहि कस्मान्न शोचसि॥<br />You are fettered with Varuna's noose and has been struck with my thunderbolt. Your wives and riches have been taken away. Tell us why you do not grieve.</p>
<p id='18'>नष्टश्रीविभवभ्रष्टो यन्न शोचसि दुष्करम्। त्रैलोक्यराज्यनाशे हि कोऽन्यो जीवितुमुत्सहेत्॥<br />Shorn of prosperity and fallen away from affluence, you do not gricve. This indeed, is something very remarkable. Who else, O Vali, then one like you, could dare lives thus after being shorn of the sovereignty of the three worlds?</p>
<p id='19'>एतच्चान्यच्च परुषं ब्रुवन्तं परिभूय तम्। श्रुत्वा सुखमसम्भ्रान्तो बलिवैरोचनोऽब्रवीत्॥<br />Hearing without any pain these and other cutting words that Indra said asserting the while his own superiority over him. Vali the son of Virochana fearlessly answered him thus.</p>
<p id='20'>बलिरुवाच निगृहीते मयि भृशं शक्र किं कत्थितेन ते। वज्रमुद्यम्य तिष्ठन्तं पश्यामि त्वां पुरंदर॥<br />When calamities have assailed me, O Shakra, what do you gain by such brag now? To-day I see you, O Purandara stand before me with the thunder-bolt upraised in your hand.</p>
<p id='21'>अशक्तः पूर्वमासीस्त्वं कथञ्चिच्छक्ततां गतः। कस्त्वदन्य इमां वाचं सुत्रां वक्तुमर्हति॥<br />Formerly, however, you could not behave so. Now you have somehow gained that power. Indeed, who else save you could give vent to such cruel words?</p>
<p id='22'>यस्तु शत्रोर्वशस्थस्य शक्तोऽपि कुरुते दयाम्। हस्तप्राप्तस्य वीरस्य तं चैव पुरुषं विदुः॥<br />That person who, though able to punish, shows mercy towards a heroic enemies, defeated and brought under his control, is indeed a great man.</p>
<p id='23'>अनिश्चयो हि युद्धेषु द्वयोर्विवदमानयोः। एकः प्राप्नोति विजयमेकश्चैव पराजयम्॥<br />When two persons fight, victory is indeed doubtful. One of the two surely becomes victorious, and the other is defeated.</p>
<p id='24'>मा च तेऽभूत् स्वभावोऽयमिति ते देवपुङ्गवा ईश्वरः सर्वभूतानां विक्रमेण जितो बलात्॥<br />O king of gods, let not your nature be so. Do not think that you have become the king of all creatures after having defeated all with your might and prowess.</p>
<p id='25'>नैतदस्मत्कृतं शक्र नैतच्छक कृतं त्वया। यत् त्वमेवंगतो वज्रिन् यद्वाप्येवंगता वयम्॥<br />That we have become so is not, O Indra, the result of our acts. That you have become so, ) holder of the thunderbolt, is not the result of any act of yours.</p>
<p id='26'>अहमासं यथाद्य त्वं भविता त्वं यथा वयम्। मावमंस्था मया कर्म दुष्कृतं कृतमित्युत।॥<br />What I am now you will be in time. Do not disregard me, thinking that you have performed a highly difficult feat.</p>
<p id='27'>सुखदुःखे हि पुरुषः पर्यायेणाधिगच्छति। पर्यायेणासि शक्रत्वं प्राप्तः शक्र न कर्मणा॥<br />A person gets happiness and misery one after another in course of Time. You have, O Shakra, gained sovereignty of the universe in courses of Time but not by virtue of any particular merit in you.</p>
<p id='28'>काल: काले नयति मां त्वां च कालोनयत्ययम्। तेनाहं त्वं यथा नाद्यं त्वं चापि न यथा वयम्॥<br />It is Time that leads me on in his course. That same time leads you also onward. It is, therefore, that I am not what you are to-day, and you also are not what we are.</p>
<p id='29'>न मातृपितृशुश्रूषा न च दैवतपूजनम्। नान्यो गुणसमाचारः पुरुषस्य सुखावहः॥<br />Dutiful services to parents, respectful adoration of deities, due practice of any good quality,-none of these can confer happiness on any one.</p>
<p id='30'>न विद्या न तपो दानं न मित्राणि न बान्धवाः। शक्नुवन्ति परित्रातुं नरं कालेन पीडितम्॥<br />Neither knowledge nor penances, nor gifts, nor friends, nor kinsmen, can save one who is afflicted by Time.</p>
<p id='31'>नागामिनमनर्थं हि प्रतिघातशतैरपि। शक्नुवन्ति प्रतिव्योढुमृते बुद्धिबलान्नराः॥<br />Even by a thousand means, men cannot avert an impending danger. Intelligence and strength are useless in such cases.</p>
<p id='32'>पर्यायैर्हन्यमानानां परित्राता न विद्यते। इदं तु दुःखं यच्छक कर्ताहमिति मन्यसे॥<br />None can save men who are afflicted by Time's course. Because, O Shakra, you consider yourself as the actor therefore it is the root of all sorrow.</p>
<p id='33'>यदि कर्ता भवेत् कर्ता न क्रियेत कदाचन। यस्मात्तु क्रियते कर्ता तस्मात् कर्ताप्यनीश्वरः॥<br />If the seeming performner of an act is the real actor thereof, that doer then would not himself be the creation of some one else (viz., the God). Therefore, because the seeming doer is himself the creation of another, that another is the Supreme Being superior to whom there is nothing else.</p>
<p id='34'>कालेनाहं त्वामजयं कालेनाहं जितस्त्वया। गन्ता गतिमतां काल: कालः कलयति प्रजाः॥<br />Helped by Time I had defeated you. Helped by time you have defeated me. It is Time which moves all beings.</p>
<p id='35'>इन्द्र प्राकृतया बुद्ध्या प्रजलयं नावबुद्ध्यसे। केचित् त्वां बहु मन्यन्ते श्रेष्ठ्यं प्राप्तं स्वकर्मणा।॥<br />O Indra, because your intelligence is very mean you do not see that destruction awaits all things! Some, indeed, respect you as one who has acquired by his own acts the sovereignty of the universe.</p>
<p id='36'>कथमस्मद्विधो नाम जानल्लोकप्रवृत्तयः। कालेनाभ्याहतः शोचेन्मुह्येद् वाप्यथ विभ्रमेत्॥<br />But, how can one like us who know the course of the world, grieve for having been afflicted by Time, or allow our understanding to be stupefied, or give way to the influence of error?</p>
<p id='37'>नित्यं कालपरीतस्य मम वा मद्विधस्य वा। बुद्धिर्व्यसनमासाद्य भिन्ना नौरिव सीदति॥<br />Even when we are possessed by Time, coming in contact with a calamity, shall my understanding or that of one like me allow itself to be destroyed like a wrecked vessel at sea.</p>
<p id='38'>अहं च त्वं च ये चान्ये भविष्यन्ति सुराधिपाः। ते सर्वे शक यास्यन्ति मार्गमिन्द्रशतैर्गतम्॥<br />Myself, yourself, and all those who will in future become the kings of the deities, shall have, O Shakra, to follow the way along which hundreds of Indras have gone before you.</p>
<p id='39'>त्वामप्येवं सुदुर्धर्षं ज्वलन्तं परया श्रिया। काले परिणते कालः कालयिष्यति मामिव॥<br />When your hour will be full, Time will surely destroy you like me,-who are now so invincible and who now shine with matchless splendour.</p>
<p id='40'>बहूनीन्द्रसहस्राणि दैवतानां युगे युगे। अभ्यतीतानि कालेन कालो हि दुरतिक्रमः॥<br />In time's course many thousands of Indras and of gods have been swept off cycle after cycle. Time, Indeed, is irresistible.</p>
<p id='41'>इदं तु लब्ध्वा संस्थानमात्मानं बहु मन्यसे। सर्वभूतभवं देवं ब्रह्माणमिव शाश्वतम्॥<br />Having secured your present position, you think too much of yourself, even as the Creator of all beings, the divine and eternal Brahman.</p>
<p id='42'>न चेदमचलं स्थानमनन्तं वापि कस्यचित्। त्वं तु बालिशया बुद्ध्या ममेदमिति मन्यसे॥<br />Having secured your present position of yours. With none did it last for ever. On account of a foolish understanding, you consider it immutable and eternal.</p>
<p id='43'>अविश्वस्ते विश्वसिषि मन्यसे वाध्रुवे ध्रुवम्। नित्यं कालपरीतात्मा भवत्येवं सुरेश्वर॥<br />You trust in that which is not worthy of trust. You consider that to be eternal which is not eternal. O king of the gods, one who is possessed and stupefied by Time really considers himself thus.</p>
<p id='44'>ममेयमिति मोहात् त्वं राजश्रियमभीप्ससि। नेयं तव न चास्माकं न चान्येषां स्थिरा सदा॥<br />Actuated by folly you consider your present regal prosperity as yours. Know, however, that it is not permanent either for me or for you or for others.</p>
<p id='45'>अतिक्रम्य बहूनन्यांस्त्वयि तावदियं गता। कंचित् कालमियं स्थित्वा त्वयि वासव चञ्चला॥ गौर्निपानमिवोत्सृज्य पुनरन्यं गमिष्यति।<br />It had belonged to numberless persons before you. Passing over them it has now become yours. It will say with you, O Vasava, for sometime and then prove its fickleness. Like a cow leaving one drinking ditch for another, it will surely leave you for somebody else.</p>
<p id='46'>राजलोका ह्यतिक्रान्ता यान्न संख्यातुमुत्सहे॥ त्वत्तो बहुतराश्चान्ये भविष्यन्ति पुरंदर।<br />So many kings have gone before you that I venture not to calculate them. In the future also, O Purandara, numberless sovereigns will rise after you.</p>
<p id='47'>सवृक्षौषधिरत्नेयं सहसत्त्ववनाकरा॥ तानिदानीं च पश्यामि यैर्भुक्तेयं पुरा मही।<br />I do not see those kings now that had formerly enjoyed this Earth with her trees, plants, gems, living creatures, waters and mines.</p>
<p id='48'>पृथुरैलो मयो भीमो नरकः शम्बरस्तथा॥ अश्वग्रीवः पुलोमा च स्वर्भानुरमितध्वजः। प्रह्लादो नमुचिर्दक्षो विप्रचित्तिर्विरोचनः॥ ह्रीनिषेवः सुहोत्रश्च भूरिहा पुष्पवान वृषः। सत्येषुर्ऋषभो बाहुः कपिलाश्वो विरूपकः॥ बाणः कार्तस्वरो वह्निविश्वदंष्ट्रोऽथ नैऋतिः। संकोचोऽथ वरीताक्षो वराहाश्वो रुचिप्रभः॥ विश्वजित् प्रतिरूपश्च वृषाण्डो विष्करो मधुः। हिरण्यकशिपुश्चैव कैटभश्चैव दानवः॥ दैतेया दानवाश्चैव सर्वे ते नैर्ऋतैः सह। एते चान्ये च बहव पूर्वे पूर्वतराश्च ये॥ दैत्येन्द्रा दानवेन्द्राश्च यांश्चान्याननुशुश्रुम। बहवः पूर्वदैत्येन्द्राः संत्यज्य पृथिवीं गताः॥ कालेनाभ्याहताः सर्वे कालो हि बलवत्तरः।<br />Prithu, Aila, Maya, Bhima, Naraka, Shamvara, Ashvagriva, Puloman, Svarbhanu, whose standard was of immeasurable height, Prahrada, Namuchi, Daksha, Vipprachitti, Virochana, Hrinisheva, Suhotra, Bhurihan, Pushavat, Vrisha, Satyepsu, Rishava, Vahu, Kapilashva, Virupaka, Vana, Karttashvara, Vahni, Vishvadangshtra, Nairiti, Sankocha, Varitaksha, Varaha, Ashva, Ruchiprabha, Vishvajit, Pratirupa, Vrishanda, Vishkara, Madhu, Hiranyakashipu, the Danava Kaitabha, and many others that were Daityas and Danavas and Rakshasas, these and many more not named, of remote and remoter ages, great Daityas and foremost of Danavas, whose names we have heard,-indeed, many foremost of Daityas of former times,-have passed away, leaving the Earth. All of them were possessed by Time. Time proved mere powerful than all of them.</p>
<p id='49'>सर्वैः ऋतुशतैरिष्टं न त्वमेकः शतक्रतुः॥ सर्वे धर्मपराश्चासन् सर्वे सततसत्रिणः।<br />All of them had adored the Creator in hundreds of sacrifices. You are not the only person that has done so. All of them were given to righteousness and all of them always celebrated great sacrifices.</p>
<p id='50'>अन्तरिक्षचराः सर्वे सर्वेऽभिमुखयोधिनः॥ सर्वे संहननोपेताः सर्वे परिघबाहवः।<br />All of them were capable of passing through the welkin and all were heroes that never retreated from the battle field. All of them had very strong bodies and all had arms resembling heavy bludgeons.</p>
<p id='51'>सर्वे मायाशतधराः सर्वे ते कामरूपिणः॥ सर्वे समरमासाद्य न श्रूयन्ते पराजिताः।<br />All of them were adepts in hundreds of illusions, and all could assume any form they liked. We have never heard that having undertaken a battle any of them had ever met with defeat.</p>
<p id='52'>सर्वे सत्यव्रतपराः सर्वे कामविहारिणः॥ सर्वे वेदव्रतपराः सर्वे चैव बहुश्रुताः।<br />All observed the vow of truth, and all of them sported as they wished. Devoted to the Vedas and Vedic rites, all of them were endued with great learning.</p>
<p id='53'>सर्वे सम्मतमैश्वर्यमीश्वराः प्रतिपेदिरे॥ न चैश्वर्यमदस्तेषां भूतपूर्वो महात्मनाम्।<br />Endued with great might, all of them had gained the highest prosperity and affluence. But none of those great kings lead the pride of sovereignty.</p>
<p id='54'>सर्वे यथार्हदातारः सर्वे विगतमत्सराः॥ सर्वे सर्वेषु भूतेषु यथावत् प्रतिपेदिरे।<br />All of them were liberal giving to each what each deserved. All of them behaved properly and duly by all creatures.</p>
<p id='55'>सर्वे दाक्षायणीपुत्राः प्राजापत्या महाबलाः॥ ज्वलन्तः प्रतपन्तश्च कालेन प्रतिसंहृताः।<br />All of them were the offspring of Daksha's daughters. Gifted with great strength, all were lords of the creation. Burning all things with their energy, all of them shone greatly. Yet all of them were carried away by Time.</p>
<p id='56'>त्वं चैवेमां यदा भुक्त्वा पृथिवीं त्यक्षसे पुनः॥ न शक्ष्यसि तदा शक्र नियन्तुं शोकमात्मनः।<br />As regards you. ( Shakra, it is clear that when you shall have, after enjoying the Earth, to leave her you will not be able to control your grief.</p>
<p id='57'>मुञ्चेञ्छां कामभोगेषु मुञ्चेमं श्रीभवं मदम्॥६४! एवं स्वराज्यनाशे त्वं शोकं सम्प्रसहिष्यसि।<br />Relinquish this desire for objects of affection and enjoyment. Relinquish this pride begotten by prosperity. If you act thus, you will then be able to bear the grief consequent on the loss of sovereignty.</p>
<p id='58'>शोककाले शुचो मा त्वं हर्षकाले च मा हृषः॥ अतीतानागतं हित्वा प्रत्युत्पन्नेन वर्तय।<br />When the hour of sorrow comes, do not give way to it. Likewise, when the hour of joy comes, do not rejoice. Not thinking of both the past and the future, live contentedly with the present.</p>
<p id='59'>मां चेदभ्यागतः कालः सदा युक्तमतन्द्रितः॥ क्षमस्व नचिरादिन्द्र त्वामप्युपगमिष्यति।<br />When Time that never sleeps came upon me that had always been mindful of my duties, bend you heart to the ways of peace, O Indra, for that same Time will very soon meet you.</p>
<p id='60'>त्रासयन्निव देवेन्द्र वाग्भिस्तक्षसि मामिह॥ संयते मयि नूनं त्वमात्मानं बहू मन्यसे।<br />You cut me to the quick with your words, and you seem deterinined to terrorise me. Indeed, finding me calm, you think very highly of you.</p>
<p id='61'>कालः प्रथममायान्मां पश्चात् त्वामनुधावति॥ तेन गर्जसि देवेन्द्र पूर्वं कालहते मयि।<br />Time had first attacked me. It is even now behind you. I was at first defeated by Time. It was therefore that you did afterwards succeed in defeating me for which you are bragging thus.</p>
<p id='62'>को हि स्थातुमलं लोके मम क्रुद्धस्य संयुगे॥ कालस्तु बलवान् प्राप्तस्तेन तिष्ठसि वासव। यत् तद् वर्षसम्रान्तं पूर्णं भवितुमर्हति॥ यथा मे सर्वगात्राणि न सुस्थानि महौजसः।<br />Formerly, when I used to become angry, what person was there on Earth who could stand before me in battle? Time however, is stronger. He has overwhelmed me. It is therefore, O Vasava, that you are able to stand before me. Those thousand celestial years, over which your reign extends will surely come to an end.</p>
<p id='63'>अहमैन्द्राच्च्युतः स्थानात् त्वमिन्द्रः प्रकृतोदिवि॥ सुचित्रे जीवलोकेऽस्मिन्नुपास्यः कालपर्ययात्। किं हि कृत्वा त्वमिन्द्रोऽद्य किं वा कृत्वा वयं च्युताः।<br />You will then fall and your limbs will become as miserable as mine now even though I am endued with great energy. I have fallen away from the high place that is occupied by the king of the three worlds. You are not the real Indra in heaven.</p>
<p id='64'>त्वमेव हि पुरा काल: कर्ता विकर्ता च सर्वमन्यदकारणम्। नाशं विनाशमैश्वर्यं सुखं दुःखं भवाभवौ॥<br />By virtue of Time's course, you are now an object of universal adoration in this charming world of living beings. Can you say what is that by having done which you have become Indra to-day and what also is that by having done which we have falls off from the position we had occupied.</p>
<p id='65'>विद्वान् प्राप्यैवमत्यर्थं न प्रहृष्येन्न च व्यथेत्। त्वमेव हीन्द्र वेत्थास्मान् वेदाहं त्वां च वासव॥<br />Time is the one creator and destroyer. Nothing else is cause. By encountering any of these, viz.. decline, fall, sovereignty, happiness, misery, birth, and death a learned person neither rejoices nor grieves. You, O Indra, know us. We also, O Vasava, know you.</p>
<p id='66'>किं कत्थसे मां किं च त्वं कालेन निरपत्रपः। वेत्थ यत् तदा पौरुषं मम॥<br />Why then do you brag thus before me, forgetting, O shameless one, that it is Time that has made you what you are? You yourself saw what my prowess was in those days.</p>
<p id='67'>समरेषु च विक्रान्तं पर्याप्तं तन्निदर्शनम्। आदित्याश्चैव रुद्राश्च साध्याश्च वसुभिः सह॥ मया विनिर्जिताः पूर्वं मरुतश्च शचीपते। त्वमेव शक्र जानासि देवासुरसमागमे॥ नियतं कालपाशेन बद्धं शक्र विकस्थसे। समेता विबुधा भग्नास्तरसा समरे मया। पर्वताश्चासकृत् क्षिप्ताः सवनाः सवनौकसः॥<br />The energy and might used to display in all my battles, prove it clearly. The Adityas, the Rudras, the Saddhyas, the Vasus, and the Maruts, O lord of Shachi, were all defeated by me. You know it well yourself, O Shakra, that in the great battle between the gods and the Asuras, the assembled gods were speedily। routed by me by the fury of my attack. Mountains with their forests and the denizens, were repeatedly hurled by us.</p>
<p id='68'>सटङ्कशिखरा भग्नाः समरे मूलि ते मया। किं नु शक्यं मया कर्तुं कालो हि दुरतिक्रमः॥<br />I broke on your head, many mountain summits with craggy edges. What, however, can I do now? Time cannot be resisted.</p>
<p id='69'>न हि त्वां नोत्सहे हन्तुं सवज्रमपि मुष्टिना। न त विक्रमकालोऽयं क्षमाकालोऽयमागतः॥<br />If it were not so, do not think that I would not have dared to kill you with that thunderbolt of yours with even a blow of my fist. The present, however, is not the hour when I should display my prowess. The present hour is such that I should remain silent and tolerate everything.</p>
<p id='70'>तेन त्वां मर्षये शक्र दुर्मर्षणतरस्त्वया। तं मां परिणते काले परीतं कालवह्निना॥<br />It is therefore, O Shakra, that I put up with all this insolence of yours. Know, however, that I am less able to bear insolence than even you.</p>
<p id='71'>अयं स पुरुषः श्यामो लोकस्य दुरतिक्रमः॥ बद्ध्वा तिष्ठति मां रौद्रः पशुं रशनया यथा।<br />There stands that dark individual who cannot be resisted by the world. There he of fierce form; stands, having bound me like an inferior animal bound with ropes.</p>
<p id='72'>लाभालाभौ सुखं दुःखं कामक्रोधौ भवाभवौ॥ वधबन्धप्रमोक्षं च सर्वं कालेन लभ्यते।<br />Gain and loss, happiness and misery, lust and anger, birth and death, captivity and release,-these all one meets in Time's course.</p>
<p id='73'>नाहं कर्ता न कर्ता त्वं कर्ता यस्तु सदा प्रभुः॥ सोऽयं पचति कालो मां वृक्षे फलमिवागतम्।<br />I am not the actor. You are not the actor, He is the actor who is omnipotent. Time ripens me like a fruit that is on a tree.</p>
<p id='74'>यान्येव पुरुषः कुर्वन् सुखैः कालेन युज्यते॥ पुनस्तान्येव कुर्वाणो दुःखै कालेन युज्यते।<br />There are certain acts by doing which one person enjoys happiness in Time's course. By doing those very acts another reaps misery in the course of Time.</p>
<p id='75'>न च कालेन कालज्ञः स्पृष्टः शोचितुमर्हति॥ तेन शक्र न शोचामि नास्ति शोके सहायता। यदा हि शोचत: शोको व्यसनं नापकर्षति॥ सामर्थ्य शोचतो नास्तीत्यतोऽहं नाद्य शोचिमि।<br />Conversant as I am with the virtues of Time, I should not grieve when it is Time that has attacked me. It is therefore, O Shakra, that I do not grieve. Grief can do us no good. The grief of one that indulges in grief never dissipates his calamity. On the other hand, grief destroys his power.
