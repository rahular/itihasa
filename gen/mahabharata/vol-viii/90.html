<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 263</h3><h4>The same subject</h4><p id='1'>जाजलिरुवाच अयं प्रवर्तितो धर्मस्तुलां धारयता त्वया। स्वर्गद्वारं च वृत्ति च भूतानामवरोत्स्यते॥<br />Jajali said This duty which you, O holder of scales, describe, shuts the door of heaven against all creatures and puts a stop to the very means of their livelihood.</p>
<p id='2'>कृष्या ह्यन्नं प्रभवति ततस्त्वमपि जीवसि। पशुभिश्चौषधीभिश्च मा जीवन्ति वाणिज॥<br />From agriculture comes food. That food gives maintenance even to you. With the help of animals, crops and herbs, human beings, O trader, can maintain themselves.</p>
<p id='3'>ततो यज्ञः प्रभवति नास्तिक्यमपि जल्पसि। न हि वर्तेदयं लोको वार्तामुत्सृज्य केवलाम्॥<br />From animals and food sacrifices originate. Your doctrines are atheistical. This world will come to an end if the means by which life is upheld have to be given up.</p>
<p id='4'>तुलाधार उवाच वक्ष्यामि जाजले वृत्तिं नास्मि ब्राह्मण नास्तिकः। न यज्ञं च विनिन्दामि यज्ञवित् तु सुदुर्लभः॥४॥<br />Tuladhara said I shall now describe the topic of the means of livelihood. I am not, O Brahmana, an atheist. I do not speak against Sacrifices. The man, however, is very rare who is truly an adept in sacrifice.</p>
<p id='5'>नमो ब्राह्मणयज्ञाय ये च यज्ञविदो जनाः। स्वयज्ञं ब्राह्मणा हित्वा क्षत्रयज्ञमिहास्थिताः॥<br />I bow to that Sacrifice which is laid down for Brahmanas, I bow also to them who are adepts in that Sacrifice. Alas, having abandoned the Sacrifice that is ordained for them, the Brahmanas have begun to perform Sacrifices that are for Kashatriyas.</p>
<p id='6'>लुब्धैर्वित्तपरैर्ब्रह्मन् नास्तिकैः सम्प्रवर्तितम्। वेदवादानविज्ञाय सत्याभासमिवानृतम्॥<br />Many persons of faith, O twice-born one, who hanker after wealth, without having understood the true meaning of the sayings of the Shrutis, and proclaiming things that are in sooth false but that have the show of truth, have introduced many sorts of Sacrifices,</p>
<p id='7'>इदं देयमिदं देयमिति चायं प्रशस्यते। अतः स्तैन्यं प्रभवति विकर्माणि च जाजले॥<br />This should be given away in this Sacrifice. This other thing should be given away in this other Sacrifice. The first of this is very praiseworthy.-The result, however, of all this, ( Jajali, is that theft and many evil acts originate.</p>
<p id='8'>यदेव सुकृतं हव्यं तेन तुष्यन्ति देवताः। नमस्कारेण हविषा स्वाध्यायैरौषधैस्तथा॥<br />It should be known that only that sacrificial offering which was gained by fair means can please the deities. There are abundant proofs in the scriptures that the adoration of the gods may be done with bows, with libations poured on the fire, with recitation or changing of the Vedas, and with plants and herbs.</p>
<p id='9'>पूजा स्याद् देवतानां हि यथा शास्त्रनिदर्शनम्। इष्टापूर्तादसाधूनां विगुणा जायते प्रजा॥<br />Sinful men get wicked children, from their religious acts. Covetous men beget covetous children, and contented men beget contented children.</p>
<p id='10'>लुब्धेभ्यो जायते लुब्धः समेभ्यो जायते समः। यजमाना यथाऽऽत्मानमृत्विजश्च तथा प्रजाः॥ यज्ञात् प्रजा प्रभवति नभसोऽम्भ इवामलम्।<br />If the sacrificer and the priest allow themselves to be guided by desire of fruit, their children take the stigma. If, however, they are not moved by the desire of fruit, their children become the same. From Sacrifices originate children like clear water from the sky.</p>
<p id='11'>अग्नौ प्रास्ताहुतिर्ब्रह्मचादित्यमुपगच्छति॥ आदित्याज्जायते वृष्टिर्वृष्टेरन्नं ततः प्रजाः।<br />The libations poured on the sacrificial fire get up to the Sun. From the Sun originates rain. From rain comes food. From food are born living creatures.</p>
<p id='12'>तस्मात् सुनिष्ठिताः पूर्वे सर्वान् कामांश्च लेभिरे॥ अकृष्टपच्या पृथिवी आशीर्भिर्वीरुधोऽभवन्।<br />In days of yore inen religiously given to Sacrifices used to attain therefrom the fruition of all their wishes. The Earth gave crops without cultivation. The blessings of the Rishis produced herbs and plants.</p>
<p id='13'>न ते यज्ञेष्वात्मसु वा फलं पश्यन्ति किंचन॥ शङ्कमानाः फलं यज्ञे ये यजेरन् कथंचन। जायन्तेऽसाधवो धूर्ता लुब्धा वित्तप्रयोजनाः॥ स स्म पापकृतां लोकान् गच्छेदशुभकर्मणा। प्रमाणमप्रमाणेन यः कुर्यादशुभं नरः॥ पापात्मा सोऽकृतप्रज्ञः सदैवेह द्विजोत्तम।<br />The men of ancient times never celebrated Sacrifices from desire of fruits and never considered themselves as bound to enjoy those fruits. Those who somehow or other celebrate Sacrifices, doubting their efficacy, are born in their next lives as dishonest, wily, and greedy men greatly covetous of wealth. That man who by the help of false reasoning show all the authoritative scriptures as fraught with evil, is certain to go, for such a sinful deed, into the regions of the sinful. Such a man is surely possessed of a sinful soul, O foremost of Brahmanas, and always remains here, shorn of wisdom.</p>
<p id='14'>कर्तव्यमिति कर्तव्यं वेत्ति वै ब्राह्मणो भयम्॥ ब्रह्मैव वर्तते लोके नैव कर्तव्यतां पुनः।<br />That man who consider those acts as bounden which have been laid down in the Vedas and directed to be performed every day, who is filled with fear if he fails to perform them any day, who considers all the essentials of Sacrifices as identical with Brahma, and who never considers himself as the actor, is truly a Brahinana.</p>
<p id='15'>विगुणं च पुनः कर्म ज्याय इत्यनुशुश्रुम॥ सर्वभूतोपघातश्च फलभावे च संयमः।<br />If the acts of such a person remain incomplete or if their completion is hindered by all unclean animals, even then those acts arc, as we have heard, of supreme efficacy. If, however, those acts are performed from desire of fruit then expiation would become necessary.</p>
<p id='16'>सत्ययज्ञा दमयज्ञा अर्थलुब्धार्थतृप्तयः॥ उत्पन्नत्यागिनः सर्वे जना आसन्नमत्सराः।<br />They, who seek the acquisition of the highest object of life, who do not hanker after carthly riches, who do not care for future provision, and who are shorn of envy, follow the course of truth and practise self-control as their Sacrifice.</p>
<p id='17'>क्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञतत्त्वज्ञाः स्वयज्ञपरिनिष्ठिताः॥ ब्राह्यं वेदमधीयन्तस्तोषयन्त्यपरानपि।<br />They who know the distinction between body and soul, who are given to Yoga, and who meditate on OM, always succeed in pleasing others.</p>
<p id='18'>अखिलं दैवतं सर्वं ब्रह्म ब्रह्मणि संश्रितम्॥ तुष्यन्ति तृप्यतो देवास्तृप्तास्तृप्तस्य जाजले।<br />The universal Brahma, which is the soul of all the gods, lives in him who is conversant with Brahma. When, therefore, such a man eats and is pleased, all the gods, O Jajali, become pleased and are contented.</p>
<p id='19'>यथा सर्वरसैस्तृप्तो नाभिनन्दति किंचन॥ तथा प्रज्ञानतृप्तस्य नित्यतृप्तिः सुखोदया।<br />As one who is satisfied with all sorts of taste fells no desire for any particular taste, similarly one who is pleased with knowledge has eternal gratification which to him is a source of perfect happiness.</p>
<p id='20'>धर्माधारा धर्मसुखाः कृत्स्नव्यवसितास्तथा।॥ आस्ति नस्तत्त्वतो भूय इति प्राज्ञस्त्ववेक्षते। ते<br />Those wise men who are the refuge of righteousness and whose joy is in righteousness, are persons who have certain knowledge of what is duty and what is otherwise. One endued with such wisdom always considers all things in the universe as emanating from his own self.</p>
<p id='21'>ज्ञानविज्ञानिनः केचित् परं पारं तितीर्षवः॥ अतीव पुण्यदं पुण्यं पुण्याभिजनसंहितम्। यत्र गत्वा नशोचन्ति च च्यवन्ति व्यथन्ति च॥ तु तद् ब्रह्मणः स्थान प्राप्नुवन्तीह सात्त्विकाः।<br />Some who are gifted with knowledge, who try to reach the other shore (of this ocean of life), and who have faith, succeed in going to the region of Brahman, which yields great blessings, is highly sacred, and inhabited by pious men,-a region which is freed from sorrow, whence no body returns, and where there is no agitation or pain.</p>
<p id='22'>नैव ते स्वर्गमिच्छन्ति न यजन्ति यशोधनैः॥ सतां वानुवर्तन्ते यजन्ते चाविहिंसया।<br />Such men do not hanker after heaven. They do not worship Brahma in costly Sacrifices. They trade the path of the virtuous. The Sacrifices they celebrate are performed without injury to any creature.</p>
<p id='23'>वनस्पतीनोषधीयश्च फलं मूलं च ते विदुः॥ न चैतानृत्विजो लुब्धा याजयन्ति फलार्थिनः।<br />These men consider trees, herbs, fruits and roots as the only sacrificial offerings. Greedy priests who seek riches, never officiate at the sacrifices of these (poor) inen.</p>
<p id='24'>स्वमेव चार्थं कुर्वाणा यज्ञं चक्रुः पुनर्द्विजाः॥ परिनिष्ठतकर्माणः प्रजानुग्रहकाम्यया।<br />These regenerate men, although all their acts have been done, still perform sacrifices for doing good to all creatures making their own selves as sacrificial offerings.</p>
<p id='25'>तस्मात् तानृत्विजो लुब्धा याजयन्त्यशुभान् नरान्॥ प्रापयेयुः प्रजाः स्वर्गे स्वधर्माचरणेन वै। इति मे वर्तते बुद्धिः समा सर्वत्र जाजले॥<br />Therefore, greedy priests officiate at the Sacrifices of only those misguided persons who, without trying to attain to Liberation, scck for heaven. Those, however, who are really good, always try, by performing their own duties, to cause others to go to heaven. LoO king at both these kinds of conduct, O Jajali, I have come to regard all creatures impartially.</p>
<p id='26'>यानि यज्ञेष्विहेज्यन्ति सदा प्राज्ञा द्विजर्षभा। तेन ते देवयानेन पथा यान्ति महामुने।।३०<br />Gifted with wisdom, many leading Brahmanas celebrate Sacrifices. By performing those Sacrifices, they walk, O great ascetic, along the path wended by the gods.</p>
<p id='27'>आवृत्तिस्तस्य चैकस्य नास्त्यावृत्तिर्मनीषिणः। उभौ तौ देवयानेन गच्छतो जाजले यथा॥<br />Of the class of Sacrificers there is return (from the region where they go). Of those, however, who are truly wise there is no return. Although both classes of sacrificers, O Jajali, wend the path trodden by the gods, yet such is the difference between their ultimate ends.</p>
<p id='28'>सव्यं चैषामनडुहो युज्यन्ति च वहन्ति च। स्वयमुस्राश्च दुह्यन्ते मन:संकल्पसिद्धिभिः॥<br />On account of the success of the purposes such men form in their minds, bulls, without being forced thereto, willingly set their shoulders to the plough for helping the cultivation and to the yoke for dragging their Cars, and kine pour forth milk from udders without being touched by human hands.</p>
<p id='29'>स्वयं यूपानुपादाय यजन्ते स्वाप्तदक्षिणैः। यस्तथा भावितात्मा स्यात् स गामालब्धुमर्हति॥<br />Creating sacrificial stakes by their willforce, they celebrate many kinds of Sacrifice with profuse presents. One who is of such a purified soul may kill a cow.</p>
<p id='30'>ओषधीभिस्तथा ब्रह्मन् यजेरंस्ते न तादृशाः। इति त्यागं पुरस्कृत्य तादृशं प्रब्रवीमि ते॥<br />They, therefore, who are otherwise, should celebrate Sacrifices with herbs and plants, Because Renunciation has such merit, there I have kept it in view in speaking to you.</p>
<p id='31'>निराशिषमनारम्भं निर्नपस्कारमस्तुतिम्। अक्षीणं क्षीणकर्माणं तं देवा ब्राह्मणं विदुः॥<br />The gods consider him a Brahmana who has cast of all desire of fruit, who does not exert for worldly acts, who never bows down his head to any one, who never praises others, and who is gifted with strength though his acts have all been weakened.</p>
<p id='32'>न श्रावयन् न च यजन् न ददद् ब्राह्मणेषु च। काम्यां वृत्तिं लिप्समानः किंगतिं याति जाजले। इदं तु दैवतं कृत्वा यथा यज्ञमवाप्नुयात्॥<br />What, O Jajali, will be the end of him who does not recite the Vedas to others, who does not celebrate Sacrifices, who does not make gifts to Brahmans, and who follows a calling in which every sort of desire is indulged? By duly respecting, however, the duties which belong to Renunciation, one is sure to attain to Brahima.</p>
<p id='33'>जाजलिरुवाच न वै मुनीनां शृणुमः स्म तत्त्वं पृच्छामि ते वाणिज कष्टमेतत्। पूर्वे पूर्वे चास्य नावेक्षमाणा नातः परं तमृषयः स्थापयन्ति॥<br />We had never before, O son of a trader, heard of these subtle doctrines of ascetics who perform only mental Sacrifices. These doctrines are very difficult to understand. It is, therefore, I ask you (about them). The sages of yore were not followers of these doctrines of Yoga. Hence the succeeding sages have not mentioned them.</p>
<p id='34'>यस्मिन्नेवात्मतीर्थे न पशवः प्राप्नुयुर्मखम्। अथ स्म कर्मणा केन वाणि प्राप्नुयात् सुखम्॥ शंस ते तन्महाप्राज्ञ भृशं वै श्रद्दधामि ते।<br />If you hold that only men mentally bent like brutes fail to achieve sacrifices in the soil of the Soul, then, O son of a trader, by what acts would they succeed in securing their happiness? Tell me this, O you of great wisdom. I have great faith in your words.</p>
<p id='35'>तुलाधार उवाच उत यज्ञा उतायज्ञा मखं नार्हन्ति ते क्वचित्॥ आज्येन पयसा दना पूर्णाहुत्या विशेषतः। बालैः शृङ्गेण पादेन सम्भरत्येव गौर्मखम्॥<br />Tuladhara said Sometimes sacrifices celebrated by some persons do not become sacrifices. These men, it should be said, do not deserve performing any sacrifice. Regarding the faithful, however, only one thing, viz., the cow, is fit for upholding all sacrifices by means of full libations of clarified butter, milk, and curds, the hair at end of her tail, her horns, and her hoofs.</p>
<p id='36'>पत्नी चानेन विधिना प्रकरोति नियोजयन्। इष्टं तु दैवतं कृत्वा यथा यज्ञमवाप्नुयात्॥<br />In celebrating sacrifices, however, according to the mode I have mentioned, one may convert Faith into his married wife, for dedicating such offerings to the gods. By duly honouring such sacrifices, one is sure to attain to Brahma.</p>
<p id='37'>पुरोडाशो हि सर्वेषां पशूनां मध्य उच्यते। सर्वा नद्यः सरस्वत्यः सर्वे पुण्या: शिलोच्चयाः॥<br />Excluding all animals, the rice-ball is a worthy offering in sacrifices. All rivers are as sacred as the Sarasvati, and all mountains are sacred.</p>
<p id='38'>जाजले तीर्थमात्मैव मा स्म देशातिथिर्भव। एतानीदृशकान् धर्मानाचरनिह जाजले।॥ कारणैर्धर्मन्विच्छन् स लोकानाप्नुते शुभान्।<br />O Jajali, the Soul is itself a sacred shrine. Do not roam about on the Earth for visiting sacred places! A person, by following these duties and by seeking to acquire merit according to his own ability, undoubtedly succeeds in getting blessed regions hereafter.</p>
<p id='39'>भीष्म उवाच एतानीदृशकान् धर्मांस्तुलाधारः प्रशंसति॥ उपपत्त्याभिसम्पन्नान् नित्यं सद्भिर्निषेवितान्॥<br />These are the duties, O Yudhishthira, which Tuladhara spoke highly of-duties which are consistent with reason, and which are always followed by the good and the wise.</p>
