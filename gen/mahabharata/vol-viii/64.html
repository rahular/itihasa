<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 237</h3><h4>Knowledge by which birth and death may be avoided</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>व्यास उवाच अथ ज्ञानप्लवं धीरो गृहीत्वा शान्तिमात्मनः! उन्मजंश्च निमश्च ज्ञानमेवाभिसंश्रयेत्॥<br />Vyasa said Carried up and down in life's ocean, he that is capable of meditation catches the raft of Knowledge, and for achieving his Liberation adheres to Knowledge itself.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>शुक उवाच किं तज्ज्ञानमयो विद्या यथा निस्तरते द्वयम्। प्रवृत्तिलक्षणो धर्मो निवृत्तिरिति वा वद॥<br />Shuka said What is that Knowledge? Is it that learning by which, when error is gone, the truth reveals itselt? Or, is it those duties consisting of acts to be done or achieved, by the help of which the object sought for, may be understood or attained? Or, is it those duties, called absention from acts by which an extinction of the Soul is to be sought? Do tell me what it is, so that by its help the two, viz., birth and death, may be avoided.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>व्यास उवाच यस्तु पश्यन् स्वभावेन विनाभावमचेतनः। पुष्यते च पुनः सर्वान् प्रज्ञया मुक्तहेतुकान्॥<br />Vyasa said That fool who, believing that all this exists by its own Nature without, in sooth, an eternal foundation, satisfies by such instruction the aspirations of disciples, defeating by his dialectical ingenuity the reasons the latter might urge to the contrary, succeeds not in acquiring any truth.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>येषां चैकान्तभावेन स्वभावात् कारणं मतम्। पूत्वा तृणमिषीकां वा ते लभन्ते न किंचन॥<br />They again, who firinly believe that all Cause is due to the Nature of things, cannot acquire any truth by even listening to learned 17en or the Rishis.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>ये चैनं पक्षमाश्रित्य निवर्तन्त्यल्पमेधसः। स्वभावं कारणं ज्ञात्वा न श्रेयः प्राप्नुवन्ति ते॥<br />Those little-witted men who stop (in their speculations), having adopted either of these doctrines, those men who regard Nature as the Cause never succeed in acquiring any benefit for themselves.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>स्वभावो हि विनाशाय मोहकर्म मनोभवः। निरुतमेतयोरेतत् स्वभावपरिभावयोः॥<br />This belief in Nature (as the producing and the sustaining Cause), originating as it does from a mind labouring under the influence of error, causes the destruction of the person who cherishes it. Hear of the truth regarding these two doctrines which hold (1) that things exist by their own Nature and (2) that they flow accordingly from others that are different form, and that precede, them.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>कृष्यादीनीह कर्माणि सस्यसंहरणानि च। प्रज्ञावद्भिः प्रक्लृप्तानि यानासनगृहाणि च॥<br />Wise men take to agriculture and tillage, and the acquisition of crops and of vehicles, seats, carpets and houses.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>आक्रीडानां गृहाणां च गदानामगदस्य च। प्रज्ञावन्तः प्रयोक्तारो ज्ञानवद्भिरनुष्ठिताः॥<br />They also look to the laying of pleasuregardens, the construction of spacious palaces and the preparation of medicines for all sorts of diseases.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>प्रज्ञा संयोजयत्यथैः : प्रजा श्रेयोऽधिगच्छति। राजानो भुञ्जते राज्यं प्रज्ञया तुल्यलक्षणाः॥<br />It is wisdom (which consists in the application of means) which brings about the fruition of objects. It is wisdom which gains beneficial results. It is wisdom which enables kings to exercise and enjoy sovereignty although they are endued with attributes equal to those of persons over whom they rule.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>परावरं तु भूतानां ज्ञानेनैवोपलभ्यते। विद्यया तात सृष्टानां विद्यैवेह परा गतिः॥<br />It is by wisdom that the difference is made between the high and the low among beings. It is by wisdom that the superior and the inferior ones among created objects are made out. It is wisdom or knowledge which is greatest refuge of all things.</p>

<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>स्थावरेभ्यो विशिष्टानि जङ्गमान्युपधारयेत्। उपपन्नं हि यच्चेष्टा विशिष्येत विशेष्यया॥<br />Mobile creatures should be regarded superior to the immobile. It is reasonable that intelligence which differentiates (all nonintelligent matter), should be considered superior to (non-intelligent) matter.</p>

Of these, the former are superior to the latter. The superior ones eat various sorts of cooked food.</p>

Of those the former are superior, for the Vedas are said to live in them.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>वेदज्ञानि द्वयान्याहुः प्रवक्तृणीतराणि च। प्रवक्तणि विशिष्टानि सर्वधर्मोपधारणात्॥ विज्ञायन्ते हि यैर्वेदाः सधर्माः सक्रियाफला:। सधर्मा निखिला वेदाः प्रवक्तृभ्यो विनिःसृताः॥<br />Those who are acquainted with the Vedas are said to be of two sorts, viz., those who lecture on the Vedas and those who are otherwise. Of these the former, who are wellread in the Vedas, and are conversant with the duties and the rites laid down in them, and the fruits of those duties and rites, are superior for their declaring all those duties and rites.
