They forsake all sorts of raiments and food and enjoyments which people in society like. The live abstemiously upon wild herbs, fruits, roots and leaves of various kinds. The naked Earth is their seat. They lie down on the bare earth or rocks or pebbles or gravel or sand or ashes. They are clad in grass and animal skins and barks of tree. They never shave their heads and beards or pare their nails. They perform their ablutions at regular times. They pour unfailingly libations on the ground, and on the sacred fire at the proper time. They enjoy no rest till they have swept and cleansed (their sacrificial alters). They bear without any concern cold and heat and rain and rind, and, therefore, the skin of their bodies is cracked all over and for performing various kinds of rites vows and acts, their flesh, blood, skin and bones become greatly reduced. Gifted with great patience and calmness, they live, always practising the quality of Goodness.</p>

They never injure, in thought, word, or deed, immobile objects, or creatures that are viviparous, or oviparous, or born of fifth, or called vegetables. They have no homes. They road over hills and mountains, upon shores of rivers or oceans, under shades of trees, and among temples of gods, They may go to towns or villages for living. In one town, however, they should not live for more than five nights, while in the same village they should not live for more than one night. Entering a town or a village, they should , for maintaining their life, go to the houses of liberal Brahmanas only. They should never ask for any alms but accept what is put into the bowls they carry. They should free themselves from lust, anger, pride, cupidity, delusion, miserliness, deceit, slander, vanity, and injury to creatures.</p>
