The Characteristics of liberated men</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच स एवमुक्तो द्विपदां वरिष्ठो नारायणेनोत्तमपूरुषेण। जगाद वाक्यं द्विपदां वरिष्ठं नारायणं लोकहिताधिवासम्॥<br />Bhishma said "Addressed by Narayana, that foremost of beings, in these words, Narada, the foremost of men, then said these words to Narayana for the behoof of the world.</p>
<p id='2'>नारद उवाच यदर्थमात्रप्रभवेण जन्म कृतं त्वया धर्मगृहे चतुर्धा! तत्साध्यतां लोकहितार्थमद्य गच्छामि द्रष्टुं प्रकृतिं तवाद्याम्॥<br />Narada said Let that object be fulfilled for which you, O Self-born Being, have taken birth in four forms in the house of Dharma! I shall now go for seeing your original nature.</p>
<p id='3'>पूजां गुरूणां सततं करोमि परस्य गुह्यं न तु भिन्नपूर्वम्। वेदाः स्वधीता मम लोकनाथ तप्तं तपो नानृतमुक्तपूर्वम्॥<br />I always adore my elders. I have never given out the secrets of others. O lord of the universe, I have studied the Vedas carefully. I have practised austere penances. I have never spoken a falsehood.</p>
<p id='4'>गुप्तानि चत्वारि यथागमं मे शत्रौ च मित्रे च समोऽस्मि नित्यम्। तं चादिदेवं सततं प्रपन्न एकान्तभावेन वृणोम्यजस्रम्॥<br />As laid down in the scriptures, I have always protected the four that should be protected. I always treat impartially friends and enemies. Wholly and surely given to Him, that first of gods, viz., the Supreme Soul, I incessantly worship Him.</p>
<p id='5'>एभिर्विशेषैः परिशुद्धसत्त्व: कस्मान्न पश्येयमनन्तमीशम्। तत्पारमेष्ठ्यस्य वचो निशम्य नारायणः शाश्वतधर्मगोप्ता॥ गच्छेति तं नारदमुक्तवान् स सम्पूजयित्वाऽऽत्मविधिक्रियाभिः। ततो विसृष्टः परमेष्ठिपुत्रः सोऽभ्यर्चयित्वा तमृर्षि पुराणम्॥<br />Having purified my soul by these specially meritorious acts, why shall I not succeed in seeing that Infinite Lord of the universe?-Hearing these words of Parameshthi's son, Narayana, that protector of the scriptures, said to him, saying,-Go, O Narada!—Before sending him away, however, the great god adored the celestial Rishi with those rites and ceremonies which have been laid down in the scriptures by himself. Narada also duly honoured the ancient Rishi Narayana. After such honours had been exchanged, the son of Parameshthi left that spot.</p>
<p id='6'>स्ततोऽधिमेरौ सहसा निलिल्ये। मेकान्तमासाद्य गिरेः स शृङ्गे॥<br />Endued with high Yoga-power, Narada suddenly soared into the sky and reached the summit of the mountains of Meru. Proceeding to a secluded spot on that summit, the great ascetic took rest for a short time.</p>
<p id='7'>आलोकयन्नुत्तरपश्चिमेन ददर्श चाप्यद्भुतमुक्तरूपम्। क्षीरोदधेर्योत्तरतो हि द्वीपः श्वेतः स नाम्ना प्रथितो विशालः॥<br />He then caste his eyes towards the northwestern direction and saw an exceedingly wonderful spectacle. Towards the north, in the ocean of Milk, there is a large island named the White Island.</p>
<p id='8'>मेरोः सहस्रः स हि योजनानां द्वात्रिंशतोर्ध्वं कविभिनिरुक्तः। अनिन्द्रियाश्चानशनाश्च तत्र निष्पन्दहीनाः सुसुगन्धिनस्ते॥<br />The learned say that its distance from the mountains of Meru is greater than thirty-two thousands Yojanas. The inhabitants of that realin have no senses. They live without food. Their eyes are winkless. They always send forth excellent perfumes.</p>
<p id='9'>श्चक्षुर्मुषः पापकृतां नराणाम्। वज्रास्थिकायाः सममानोन्माना दिव्यावयवरूपाः शुभसारोपेताः॥<br />Their complexions are white. They are purged off of all sins. They blast the eyes of those sinners that look at them. Their bones and bodies are as hard as adamant. They consider honour and dishonour equally. They all look as if they are of divine origin. All of them are endued with auspicious marks and great strength.</p>
<p id='10'>छत्राकृतिशीर्षा मेघौघनिनादाः सममुष्कचतुष्का राजीवच्छतपादाः। षष्ट्या दन्तैर्युक्ताः शुक्लैरष्टाभिर्दष्ट्राभिर्ये जिह्वाभिर्ये विश्ववक्त्रं लेलिह्यन्ते सूर्यप्रख्यम्॥११<br />Their heads seem to be like umbrellas. Their voices are deep like that of the clouds. Each of them have four testes. The soles of their feet have hundreds of lines. They had sixty white teeth, and eight small ones. They had many tongues. With those tongues they seemed to lick the very Sun whose face is turned towards all sides.</p>
<p id='11'>देवं भक्त्या विश्वोत्पन्न यस्मात् सर्वे लोकाः सम्प्रसूताः। वेदा धर्मा मुनयः शान्ता देवाः सर्वे तस्य निसर्गः॥<br />Indeed, they seemed to be capable of devouring that great god from whom has originated the entire universe, the Vedas, the duties, and the ascetics possessing the quality of tranquillity.</p>
<p id='12'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच अनिन्द्रिया निराहारा अनिष्पन्दाः सुगन्धिनः। कथं ते पुरुषा जाताः का तेषां गतिरुत्तमा॥<br />Yudhishthira said are “O grand-father, you have said that those beings have no senses, that they do not eat anything for maintaining their lives; that their eyes are winkless, and that they always emit excellent perfumes. I ask, how were they born? What also is the superior end which they acquire?</p>
<p id='13'>ये च मुक्ता भवन्तीह नरा भरतसत्तम। तेषां लक्षणमेतद्धि तच्छ्वेतद्वीपवासिनाम्॥<br />O chief of Bharata's race, the characteristics of those men that become liberated the same as those by which the inhabitants of the White Island are distinguished?</p>
<p id='14'>तस्मान्मे संशयं छिन्धि परं कौतूहलं हि मे। त्वं हि सर्वकथारामस्त्वां चैवोपाश्रिता वयम्॥<br />Do you remove my doubts! The curiosity I feel is very great. You are the repository of all histories and narratives. As regards ourselves, we entirely depend on you for knowledge and instruction.</p>
<p id='15'>भीष्म उवाच विस्तीर्णैषा कथा राजन् श्रुता मे पितृसंनिधौ। यैषा तव हि वक्तव्या कथासारो हि सा मता॥<br />Bhishma said "This narrative, O king, which I have heard from my father, is extensive. I shall now recite it to you. Indeed, it is considered as the cream of all narratives.</p>
<p id='16'>राजोपरिचरो नाम बभूवाधिपतिर्भुवः। आखण्डलसखः ख्यातो भक्तो नारायणं हरिम्॥<br />There was, in days of yore, a king on Earth, Uparichara, by name. He was known to be the friend, of Indra the king of gods. He was devoted to Narayana called also by the name of Hari.</p>

Ever devoted to his father, was always ready for action. He acquired sovereignty of the world on account of a boon he had obtained from Narayana.</p>
<p id='18'>सात्वतं विधिमास्थाय प्राक् सूर्यमुखनिःसृतम्। पूजयामास देवेशं तच्छेषेण पितामहान्॥<br />Following the Satvata ritual that had been declared in days of yore by the Sun himself, king Uparichara used to adore the God of gods, and after his worship was over, to adore the Grandfather of the universe.</p>
<p id='19'>पितृशेषेण विप्रांश्च संविभज्याश्रितांश्च सः! शेषान्नभुक् सत्यपरः सर्वभूतेष्वहिंसकः॥<br />After adoring the departed manes, he adored the Brahmanas. He then divided the offerings among those who depended on him. With the remnant after serving those, the king satisfied his own hunger. Given to truth, the king abstained from doing any injury to any creature.</p>
<p id='20'>सर्वभावेन भक्तः स देवदेवं जनार्दनम्। अनादिमध्यनिधनं लोककर्तारमव्ययम्॥<br />With his entire soul, the king was devoted to that God of gods, viz., Janardana, who is without beginning and middle and end, who is Creator of the universe, and who is without decay of any sort.</p>
<p id='21'>तस्य नारायणे भक्तिं वहतोऽमित्रकर्षिणः। एकशय्यासनं देवो दत्तवान् देवराट् स्वयम्॥<br />Seeing the devotion to Narayana of that destroyer of foes, the divine king of the gods himself shared with him his own seat and bed.</p>

<p id='24'>पाञ्चरात्रविदो मुख्यास्तस्य गेहे महात्मनः। प्रायणं भगवत्प्रोक्तं भुञ्जते वाग्रभोजनम्॥<br />Many foremost Brahmanas, well conversant with the Pancharatra ritual, used to eat before all others the food offered to the god Narayana in the palace of that illustrious king.</p>
<p id='25'>तस्य प्रशासतो राज्यं धर्मेणामित्रघातिनः। नानृता वाक् समभवन्मनो दुष्टं न चाभवत्॥<br />As long as that destroyer of enemies continued to rule his kingdom piously, no falsehood ever escaped his lips and no evil thought ever entered his mind.</p>
<p id='26'>न च कायेन कृतवान् स पापं परमण्वपि। ये हि ते ऋषयः ख्याताः सप्त चित्रशिखण्डिनः॥ तैरेकमतिभिर्भूत्वा यत् प्रोक्तं शास्रमुत्तमम्। वेदैश्चतुर्भिः समितं कृतं मेरौ महागिरौ॥ आस्यैः सप्तभिरुद्गीण लोकधर्ममनुत्तमम्। मरीचिरत्र्यङ्गिरसौ पुलस्त्यः पुलहः क्रतुः। वसिष्ठश्च महातेजास्ते हि चित्रशिखण्डिनः॥ सप्त प्रकृतयो ह्येतास्तथा स्वायम्भुवोऽष्टमः। एताभिर्धार्यते लोकस्ताभ्यः शास्त्रं विनिःसृतम्॥<br />With his limbs he never perpetrated even the slightest crime.

The contents of that work were uttered by seven mouths, and fomed the best compendium of human duties and obsevances. Known, as already stated, by the name of ChitraShikhandins, those seven Rishis form the seven elements, and the Self-born Manu, who is the eighth in the number, formed original Nature. These eight keep up the universe, and it was these eight who promulgated the treatise referred to.</p>

The various restrictions and limitations were also laid down in it for the Earth as also for Heaven.</p>
