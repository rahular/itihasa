Tell me, O grandfather, what is that good thing which one should seek.</p>

He should then wish for children for saving his departed ancestors. Kindling his fire next, he should try to celebrate the (prescribed) sacrifices according to due rites. At last, he should enter into woods for practising contemplation.</p>

<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>न हि प्रतीक्षते मृत्युः कृतमस्य न वा कृतम्॥ को हि नाजाति कस्याद्य मृत्युकालो भविष्यति। युवैव धर्मशीलः स्यादनित्यं खलु जीवितम्। कृते धर्मे भवेत् कीर्तिरिह प्रेत्य च वै सुखम्॥<br />Who knows that Death will not approach him even to-day? In prime of life one should begin the practice of virtue. Life is fickle. If virtue be practised, one will meet fame in this, and happiness in the other, world.</p>
