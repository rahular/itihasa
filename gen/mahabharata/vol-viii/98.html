<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 271</h3><h4>Religion, Profit and Pleasure-which of them is superior. The discourse of Kundadhara</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच धर्ममर्थं च कामं च वेदाः शंसन्ति भारत। कस्य लाभो विशिष्टोऽत्र तन्मे ब्रूहि पितामह॥<br />Yudhisthira said The Vedas, O Bharata, describe Religion, Profit, and Pleasure. Tell me, however, O grand-father, the attainment of which is considered as superior.</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच अत्र ते वर्तयिष्यामि इतिहासं पुरातनम्। कुण्डधारेण यत् प्रीत्या भक्तायोपकृतं पुरा॥<br />Bhishma said About it I shall recite to you the ancient discourse of the benefit which Kundadhara in days of yore had conferred upon one who was devoted to him.</p>
<p id='3'>अधनो ब्राह्मणः कश्चित् कामाद् धर्ममवैक्षत। यज्ञार्थं सततोऽर्थार्थी तपोऽतप्यत दारुणम्॥<br />Once on a time a Brahmana shorn of riches tried to win virtue, actuated by the desire of fruit. He continually thought of riches for employing it in the celebration of sacrifices. For gaining his end he engaged in the practice of the austerest penances.</p>
<p id='4'>स निश्चयमथो कृत्वा पूजयामास देवताः। भक्त्या न चैवाध्यगच्छद् धनं सम्पूज्य देवताः॥<br />Determined to achieve his object, he began to adore the gods with great devotion. But he failed to acquire riches by such adoration of the gods.</p>
<p id='5'>ततश्चिन्तामनुप्राप्त: कतमदैवतं तु तत्। यन्मे दुतं प्रसीदेत मानुषैरजडीकृतम्॥<br />He thereupon began to think aside, What is that god, hitherto not worshipped by men, who may be forthwith favourably disposed towards me?</p>
<p id='6'>सोऽथ सौम्येन मनसा देवानुचरमन्तिके। प्रत्यपश्यज्जलधरं कुण्डधारमवस्थितम्॥<br />While thinking thus with a cool mind, he saw stationed before him that retainer of the gods, viz., the Cloud called Kundadhara.</p>
<p id='7'>दृष्ट्वैव तं महाबाहुं तस्य भक्तिरजायत। अयं मे धास्यति श्रेयो वपुरेतद्धि तादृशम्॥<br />As soon as he saw that mighty-armed being, the Brahmana's feelings of devotion were excited, and he said to himself,-This one will surely give me prosperity! Indeed, his form indicates it.</p>
<p id='8'>संनिकृष्टश्च देवस्य न चान्यैर्मानुषैर्वृतः। एष मे दास्यति धनं प्रभूतं शीघ्रमेव च।॥<br />He lives near the gods. He has not as yet been worshipped by other man. He will surely give me profuse riches without any delay!</p>
<p id='9'>ततो धूपैश्च गन्धैश्च माल्यैरुच्चावचैरपि। बलिभिर्विविधाभिश्च पूजयामास तं द्विजः॥<br />The Brahmana then, having determined thus, adored that Cloud with incense, perfumes and garlands of flowers of the most superior kind, and with various sorts of offerings.</p>
<p id='10'>ततस्त्वल्पेन कालेन तुष्टो जलधरस्तदा। तस्योपकारनियतामिमां वाचमुवाच ह॥<br />Thus adored, the Cloud became very soon pleased with his worshipper, and uttered these words of benefit to that Brahmana:</p>
<p id='11'>ब्रह्मने च सुरापे च चौरे भग्नव्रते यथा। निष्कृतिर्विहिता सद्भिः कृतघ्ने नास्ति निष्कृतिः॥<br />The wise have laid down expiation for one guilty of Brahmanicide, or of drinking alcohol, or of stealing, or of neglecting all meritorious vows. There is no expiation, however, for one who is ungrateful.</p>
<p id='12'>आशायास्तनयोऽधर्मः क्रोधोऽसूयासुतः स्मृतः। लोभः पुत्रो निकृत्यास्तु कृतम्रो नार्हति प्रजाम्॥<br />Expectation has a child named Sin. Anger, again, is considered to be a child of Envy. Cupidity is the child of Deceit. Ingratitude, however, is barnen.</p>
<p id='13'>ततः स ब्राह्मणः स्वप्ने कुण्डधारस्य तेजसा। अपश्यत् सर्वभूतानि कुशेषु शयितस्तदा॥<br />After this, that Brahmana, stretched on a bed of Kusha grass, and penetrated with the energy of Kundadhara, saw all living beings in a dream.</p>
<p id='14'>शमेन तपसा चैव भक्त्या च निरुपस्कृतः। शुद्धात्मा ब्राह्मणो रात्रौ निदर्शनमपश्यत॥<br />Indeed, on account of his absence of passion, penances, and devotion, that Brahmana of purified soul and standing aloof from all enjoyments saw in the night that effect of his devotion to Kundadhara.</p>
<p id='15'>मणिभद्रं स तत्रस्थं देवतानां महाद्युतिम्। अपश्यत महात्मानं व्यादिशन्तं युधिष्ठिर॥<br />Indeed, O Yudhishthira, he saw the great and highly effulgent Manibhadra stationed in the midst of the gods, engaged in giving his orders.</p>
<p id='16'>तत्र देवाः प्रयच्छन्ति राज्यानि च धनानि च। शुभैः कर्मभिरारब्धाः प्रच्छिन्दन्त्यशुभेषु च॥<br />There the gods seemed to be engaged in granting kingdoms and riches to men, induced by their good deeds, and in taking them away when men deviated from goodness.</p>
<p id='17'>पश्यतामथ यक्षाणां कुण्डधारो महाद्युतिः। निपत्य पतितो भूमौ देवानां भरतर्षभ॥<br />Then, O foremost of Bharata's race, the highly effulgent Kundadhara, bending himself low, laid himself down on the ground before the gods in the presences of all the Yakshas.</p>
<p id='18'>ततस्य देववचनान्मणिभद्रो महामनाः। पतितं भूमौ कुण्डधार किमिष्यते॥<br />At the command of the gods the Manibhadra said to the prostrate Kundadhara,-What does Kundadhara want?</p>
<p id='19'>कुण्डधार उवाच यदि प्रसन्ना देवा मे भक्तोऽयं ब्राह्मणो मम। अस्यानुग्रहमिच्छामि कृतं किंचित् सुखोदयम्॥<br />Thereupon Kundadhara replied,-If, indeed, the gods are gratified with me, there, that Brahmana respects me greatly. I pray for some favour being shown to him, something, that may bring him happiness.</p>
<p id='20'>ततस्तं मणिभद्रस्तु पुनर्वचनमब्रवीत्। देवानामेव वचनात् कुण्डधारं महाद्युतिम्॥<br />Hearing this, Manibhadra, ordered by the gods, once more said to the highly intelligent Kundadhara.</p>
<p id='21'>मणिभद्र उवाच उत्तिष्ठोत्तिष्ठ भद्रं ते कृतकृत्यः सुखी भव। धनार्थी यदि विप्रोऽयं धनमस्मै प्रदीयताम्॥ यावद् धनं प्रार्थयते ब्राह्मणोऽयं सखा तव। देवानां शासनात् तावदसंख्येयं ददाम्यहम्॥<br />Rise, Rise up, O Kundadhara; Your prayer has borne success! Be you happy! If this Brahmana seeks riches, let as much wealth be given to him, as he wishes. at the command of the gods I shall give him immeasurable riches.</p>
<p id='22'>विचार्य कुण्डधारस्तु मानुष्यं चलमध्रुवम्। तपसे मतिमाधत्त ब्राह्मणस्य युधिष्ठिर।॥<br />Then, thinking upon the fieeting and unreal character of the humanity, Kundadhara set his heart, O Yudhisthira, upon inclining the Brahmana to penances.</p>
<p id='23'>कुण्डधार उवाच नाहं धनानि याचामि ब्राह्मणाय धनप्रदा अन्यमेवाहमिच्छामि भक्तायानुग्रहं कृतम्॥<br />Indeed, Kundadhara said,-I do not, O giver of riches, beg for wealth on behalf of this Brahmana. I desire the bestowed of another favour upon him.</p>
<p id='24'>पृथिवीं रत्नपूर्णां वा महद् वा रत्नसंचयम। भक्ताय नाहमिच्छामि भवेदेष तु धार्मिकः॥<br />I do not pray for this devotee of mine mountains of pearls and gems, or even the whole Earth with all her riches. I wish, however, that he should be virtuous.</p>
<p id='25'>धर्मेऽस्य रमतां बुद्धिर्धर्मं चैवोपजीवतु। धर्मप्रधानो भवतु ममैषोऽनुग्रहो मतः॥<br />Let his heart find pleasure in virtue! Let him have virtue for his support. Let virtue be the foremost of all his objects. This is the favour which I am inclined to give my support. Manibhadra said</p>
<p id='26'>मणिभद्र उवाच सदा धर्मफलं राज्यं सुखानि विविधानि च। फलान्येवायमनातु कायक्लेशविवर्जितः॥<br />The fruits of virtue are always kingdom and happiness of various sorts. Let this one enjoy those fruits, always freed from all sorts of physical sufferings.</p>
<p id='27'>भीष्म उवाच ततस्तदेव बहुशः कुण्डधारो महायशाः। अभ्यासमकरोद् धर्मे ततस्तुष्टास्तु देवताः॥<br />Thus addressed, the highly illustrious Kundadhara, repeatedly prayed for virtue alone for that Brahmana. The gods were highly pleased at it.</p>
<p id='28'>मणिभद्र उवाच प्रीतास्ते देवताः सर्वा द्विजस्यास्य तथैव च। भविष्यत्येष धर्मात्मा धर्मे चाधास्यते मतिः॥<br />Then Manibhadra said The gods are all pleased with you as also with this Brahmana. This one shall become a virtuous man. He shall devote his mind to virtue.</p>
<p id='29'>ततः प्रीतो जलधरः कृतकार्णे युधिष्ठिर। ईप्सितं मनसो लब्ध्वा वरमन्यैः सुदुर्लभम्॥<br />The Cloud, Kundadhara, became pleased,O Yudhishthira, at thus having been successful in gaining his wish. The boon that he had got was one that could not be acquired by anybody else.</p>
<p id='30'>ततोऽपयत चीराणि सूक्ष्माणि द्विजसत्तमः। पार्श्वतोऽभ्याशतो न्यस्तान्यथ निर्वेदमागतः॥<br />The Brahinana then saw scattered around him many fine fabrics of cloth. Without caring for them at all, the Brahmana came to disrelish the world.</p>
<p id='31'>ब्राह्मण उवाच अयं न सुकृतं वेत्ति को न्वन्यो वेत्स्यते कृतम्। गच्छामि वनमेवाहं वरं धर्मेण जीवितुम्।३२॥<br />When this one does not attach any value to good deeds, who else will? I had better go to the forest for leading a life of righteousness.</p>
<p id='32'>भीष्म उवाच निर्वेदाद् देवतानां च प्रसादात् स द्विजोत्तमः। वनं प्रविश्य सुमहत् तप आरब्धवांस्तदा।॥<br />Bhishma said as Cherishing a distaste for the world, and through the grace also of the gods, that foremost of Brahmanas entered the forest and began to practise the austerest of penances.</p>
<p id='33'>देवतातिथिशेषेण फलमूलाशनो द्विजः। धर्मे चास्य महाराज दृढा बुद्धिरजायत॥<br />Living upon such fruits and roots remained after serving the gods and guests, the mind of that twice-born one, O king, was firmly set upon virtue.</p>
<p id='34'>त्यरत्वा मूलफलं सर्वं पर्णाहारोऽभवद् द्विजः। पर्णं त्यक्त्वा जलाहारः पुनरासीद् द्विजस्तदा।॥<br />By and bye the Brahmana, leaving off fruits and roots, began to use leaves of trees as his food. Then leaving off leaves, he took to water only as his subsistence.</p>
<p id='35'>वायुभक्षस्ततः पश्चाद् बहून वर्षगणानभूत्। न चास्य क्षीयते प्राणस्तदद्भुतमिवाभवत्॥<br />Thereafter he passed many years by living upon air only. All this time, however, his strength did not decrease. This seemed highly wonderful.</p>
<p id='36'>धर्मे च श्रद्दधानस्य तपस्युग्रे च वर्ततः। कालेन महता तस्य दिव्या दृष्टिरजायत॥<br />Devoted to virtue and engaged in the practice of the severest austerities, after a long time he gained spiritual vision.</p>
<p id='37'>तस्य बुद्धिः प्रादुरासीद् यदि दद्यामहं धनम्। तुष्टः कस्यचिदेवेह मिथ्यावाङ् न भवेन्मम॥<br />He then thought, saying to himself,-If, being pleased with anybody I give him riches, my speech would never be untrue.</p>
<p id='38'>ततः प्रहृष्टवदनो भूय आरब्धवांस्तपः। भूयश्चचिन्तयत् सिद्धो यत्परं सोऽभिमन्यते॥<br />With a face lighted up by smiles, he once more began to practise severer austerities.</p>
<p id='39'>यदि दद्यामहं राज्यं तुष्टो वै यस्य कस्यचित्। स भवेदचिराद् राजा न मिथ्या वाग् भवेन्मम॥<br />And once more, having gained (higher) success, he thought that he could by his-will force, then create the very highest objects. If, pleased with any person whatsoever I give him even sovereignty, he will immediately become a king, for my words will never be falsified.</p>
<p id='40'>तस्य साक्षात् कुण्डधारो दर्शयामास भारत। ब्राह्मणस्य तपोयोगात् सौहृदेनाभिचोदितः॥<br />While he was thinking thus, kundadhara, actuated by his friendship for the Brahmana and no less by the ascetic success which the Brahmana had gained, appeared before him, O Bharata.</p>
<p id='41'>समागम्य स तेनाथ पूजांचक्रे यथाविधि। ब्राह्मणः कुण्डधारस्य विस्मितश्चाभवन्नृप॥<br />Meeting with him the Brahmana offered him adorations according to the observances ordained. The Brahmana, however, felt some surprise, O king.</p>
<p id='42'>ततोऽब्रवीत् कुण्डधारो दिव्यं ते चक्षुरुत्तमम्। पश्य राज्ञां गतिं विप्र लोकांश्चैव तु चक्षुषा॥<br />Then Kundadhara addressed the Brahmana, saying, you have now got an excellent and spiritual eye! See with this vision of yours the end which is attained by kings, and see all the worlds besides.</p>
<p id='43'>ततो राजसहस्राणि मग्नानि निरये तदा। दूरादपश्यद् विप्रः स दिव्ययुक्तेन चक्षुषा॥<br />The Brahmana then, then, his spiritual vision, saw from a distance thousands of kings sunk in hell.</p>
<p id='44'>कुण्डधार उवाच मां पूजयित्वा भावेन यदि त्वं दुःखमाप्नुयाः। कृतं मया भवेत् किं ते कश्च तेऽनुग्रहो भेवत्॥<br />Kundadhara said After having adored me with devotion you had got sorrow for your share, what then would have been the good done to you by me, and what the value of my favour.</p>
<p id='45'>पश्य पश्य च भूयस्त्वं कामानिच्छेत् कथं नरः। स्वर्गद्वारं हि संरुद्धं मानुषेषु विशेषतः॥<br />Look, look, for what end do men seek the gratification of carnal enjoyments! The door of heaven is closed to men.</p>
<p id='46'>भीष्म उवाच ततोऽपश्यत् स कामं च क्रोधं लोभं भयं मदम्। निद्रां तन्द्री तथाऽऽलस्यमावृत्य पुरुषान् स्थितान्॥<br />Bhishma said The Brahmana then saw many men living in this world, embracing lust, anger, avarice, fear, pride, sheep, procrastination, and activity.</p>
<p id='47'>कुण्डधार उवाच एतैर्लोकाः संसुरुद्धा देवानां मानुषाद् भयम्। तथैव देववचनाद् विघ् कुर्वन्ति सर्वशः॥<br />All human beings are enchained with these. The gods are afraid of men. These vices, at the order of the gods, mar and disconcert on all sides.</p>
<p id='48'>न देवैरननुज्ञातः कश्चिद् भवति धार्मिकः। एष शक्तोऽसि तपसा दातुं राज्यं धनानि च॥<br />No man can become virtuous unless allowed by the gods. You have become competent to give away kingdoms and riches through your penances!</p>
<p id='49'>भीष्म उवाच ततः पपात शिरसा ब्राह्मणस्तोयधारिणे। उवाच चैनं धर्मात्मा महान् मेऽनुग्रहः कृतः॥<br />Bhishma said Thus addressed, the pious Brahmana, bending his head to that Cloud, laid himself low on the ground, and said,-You have, indeed, done me a great favour!</p>
<p id='50'>कामलोभानुबन्धेन पुरा ते यदसूयितम्। मया स्नेहमविज्ञाय तत्र मे क्षन्तुमर्हसि॥<br />Unconscious of the great love shown by you towards me,I through the influency of desire and avarice, could not show good will towards you.</p>
<p id='51'>क्षान्तमेव मयेत्युक्त्वा कुण्डधारो द्विजर्षभम्। सम्परिष्वज्य बाहुभ्यां तत्रैवान्तरधीयत॥<br />Then Kundadhara said That foremost of twice-born ones,-I have forgiven you!-and having embraced him with his arms disappeared there and then.</p>
<p id='52'>ततः सर्वांस्तदा लोकान् ब्राह्मणोऽनुचचार हा कुण्डधारप्रसादेन तपसा सिद्धिमागतः॥<br />The Brahmana then travelled through all the worlds, having acquired ascetic through the favour of Kundadhara.</p>
<p id='53'>विहायसा च गमनं तथा संकल्पितार्थता। धर्माच्छक्तया तथा योगाद् या चैव परमा गतिः॥<br />Through the power gained from virtue and penances, one acquires power to pass through the skies and to fructify all his wishes and purposes, and finally attain to the highest end.</p>
<p id='54'>देवताः ब्राह्मणा: सन्तो यक्षा मानुषचारणाः। धार्मिकान् पूजयन्तीह न धनाढ्यान् न कामिनः॥<br />Thë gods, Brahmanas, Yakshas, and all good men and Charanas always adore the virtuous but never the rich given up to the indulgence of their desires. success</p>
<p id='55'>सुप्रसन्ना हि ते देवा यत्ते धर्मे रता मतिः। धने सुखकला काचिद् धर्मे तु परमं सुखम्॥<br />The gods are truly placed with you since your mind is devoted to virtue. In riches there may be a very little happiness but in virtue the extent of happiness is very great.</p>
