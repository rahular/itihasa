<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 359</h3><h4>The story of the Naga king Padma</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच अथ काले बहुतिथे पूर्णे प्राप्तो भुजङ्गमः। दत्ताभ्यनुज्ञः स्वं वेश्म कृतकर्मा विवस्वता॥<br />Bhishma said Upon the expire of full fifteen days, the Naga king (Padmanabha), having finished his task of dragging the car of the Sun and obtained the latter's permission, returned to his own house.</p>
<p id='2'>तं भार्याप्युपचक्राम पादशौचादिभिर्गुणैः। उपपन्नां च तां साध्वीं पन्नगः पर्यपृच्छत॥ अथ त्वमसि कल्याणि देवतातिथिपूजने। पूर्वमुक्तेन विधिना युक्ता युक्तेन मत्समम्॥<br />Seeing him return, his wife approached him quickly for washing his feet and dutifully satisfying other tasks of a similar nature. Having performed these tasks, she sat by his side. The Naga then, refreshed from fatigue, addressed his dutiful and chaste wife, saying, I hope, my dear wife, that during my absence you have not neglected to adore the gods and guests according to the instructions I gave you, and according to the ordinances laid down in the scriptures.</p>

I trust that you have not gone beyond the barriers of duty and virtue.</p>
<p id='4'>नागभार्योवाच शिष्याणां गुरुशुश्रूषा विप्राणां वेदधारणम्। भृत्यानां स्वामिवचनं राज्ञो लोकानुपालनम्॥ सर्वभूतपरित्राणं क्षत्रधर्म इहोच्यते। वैश्यानां यज्ञसंवृत्तिरातिथेयसमन्विता॥<br />The duty of disciples is to wait respectfully upon their preceptor for doing his bidding; that of Brahmanas is to study the Vedas and bear them in memory; that of servants is to obey the commands of their masters; that of the king is to protect his people by supporting the good and punishing the wicked. It is said that the duties of a Kshatriya are the protection of all creatures from wrong and oppression.</p>

I have also, without the slightest negligence, performed the duties of hospitality towards persons arrived as guests in your house.</p>
