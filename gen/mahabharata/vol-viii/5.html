<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 178</h3><h4>Value of wealth. The various instructions</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>भीष्म उवाच अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। गीतं विदेहराजेन जनकेन प्रशाम्यता॥<br />"Regarding it is also cited the old story of the verses sung by Janaka, the king of the Videhas, who had so qualified himself as to obtain tranquillity of the soul.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>अनन्तमिव मे वित्तं यस्य मे नास्ति किञ्चन। मिथिलायां प्रदीप्तायां न मे दह्यति किञ्चन॥<br />What the monarch said was,-My wealth is unlimited, At the same time I have nothing. If the whole of (my kingdom) Mithila be reduced to ashes in a conflagration, I shall lose nothing.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>अत्रैवोदाहरन्तीमं बोध्यस्य पदसंचयम्। निर्वेदं प्रति विन्यस्तं तं निबोध युधिष्ठिर॥<br />Once on a time the royal son of Nahusa (Yayati) asked the Rishi Vodhya who had, on account of Rcnunciation, attained to tranquillity of soul and who had a through knowledge of the scriptures. The king said</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>बोध्यं शान्तमृषि राजा नाहुषः पर्यपृच्छत। निर्वेदाच्छान्तिमापन्नं शास्त्रप्रज्ञानतर्पितम्॥ उपदेशं महाप्राज्ञ शमस्योपदिशस्व मे। का बुद्धिं समनुध्याय शान्तश्चरसि निर्वृतः॥<br />O you of great wisdom, vouchsafe me those instructions which lead to tranquillity. What is that understanding which had enabled you to wander over the world in tranquillity of soul and free yourself from all acts?</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>बोध्य उवाच उपदेशेन वर्तामि नानुशास्मीह कंचन। लक्षणं तस्य वक्ष्येऽहं तत् स्वयं परिमृश्यताम्॥<br />Vodhya said I follow the principles of others and never thrust inyself as an instructor. I shall, however, give you the outlines of those principles. Reflection will enable you to catch their spirit.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>पिङ्गलाककुररः सर्पः सारङ्गान्वेषणं वने। इषुकारः कुमारी च षडेते गुरवो मम॥<br />Pingala, the osprey, the snake, the bee in the forest, the maker of shafts (in the story), and the maiden (in the story),-these six are my preceptors.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>भीष्म उवाच आशा बलवती राजन् नैराश्यं परमं सुखम्। आशां निराशां कृत्वा तु सुखं स्वपिति पिङ्गला॥<br />Hope is the one powerful agent to agitate human breast, O king. Freedom from hope is supreme bliss. Reducing hope to a nullity, Pingala sleeps in peace.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>सामिषं कुररं दृष्ट्वा वध्यमानं निरामिषैः। आमिषस्य परित्यागात् कुररः सुखमेधते॥<br />Seeing an osprey with a piece of meat in his breaks, those that have been unable to find any meat for themselves, pounce upon him and finally make him a osprey, while a certain other osprey, by abstaining from meat altogether, became happy.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>गृहारम्भो हि दुःखाय न सुखाय कदाचन। सर्पः परकृतं वेश्म प्रविश्य सुखमेधते॥<br />To build a house for one's ownself conduces not to his happiness but becomes the source of his annoyance. The snake residing in another creature's place of abode, lives in happiness.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>सुखं जीवन्ति मुनयो भैक्ष्यवृत्तिं समाश्रिताः। अद्रोहेणैव भूतानां सारङ्गा इव पक्षिणः॥<br />Adopting the life of mendicancy, the ascetics live in happiness, without having any object of fear from any creature, like the bees in the forest.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>इषुकारो नरः कश्चिदिषावासक्तमानसः। समीपेनापि गच्छन्तं राजानं नावबुद्धवान्॥<br />A certain shaft-maker busy with his work, was so deeply engrossed with it that he did not notice the king who was passing by him.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>बहूनां कलहो नित्यं द्वयोः संकथनं ध्रुवम्। एकाकी विचरिष्यामि कुमारीशंखको यथा॥<br />When many herd together, it foments dispute. Even when two reside together, they are sure to talk with each other. I, however, like the anklet made of sea-shells in the wrist of the maiden in the story wander alone.'</p>
