<h3>Mokshadharma Parva: Chapter 328</h3><h4>The suspension of the Vedas. The disciples of Vyasa go down for sub-dividing them</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच एतच्छ्रुत्वा गुरोर्वाक्यं व्यासशिष्या महौजसः। परिषस्वजिरे तदा॥ अन्योन्यं हृष्टमनसः<br />"Hearing these words of their preceptor, Vyasa's disciples gifted with great energy, became filled with the joy and embraced one another.</p>
<p id='2'>उक्ताः स्मो यद् भगवता तदात्वायतिसंहितम्। तन्नो मनसि संरूढं करिष्यामस्तथा च तत्॥<br />Addressing one another, these said,-We will remember and act according to what has been said by our illustrious preceptor in view of our future well-being.</p>
<p id='3'>अन्योन्यं संविभाष्यैवं सुप्रीतमनसः पुनः। विज्ञापयन्ति स्म गुरुं पुनर्वाक्यविशारदाः॥ शैलादस्मान्महीं गन्तुं कासितं नो महामुने। वेदान नेकथा कर्तुं यदि ते रुचितं प्रभो॥<br />Having said this to one another with gladdened hearts, the disciples of Vyasa, who were consummate masters of words, once more addressed their preceptor and said,-If it pleases you, O powerful one we wish to get down from this mountain to the Earth, O great ascetic, for the object of sub-dividing the Vedas.</p>
<p id='4'>शिष्याणां वचनं श्रुत्वा पराशरसुतः प्रभुः। प्रत्युवाच ततो वाक्यं धर्मार्थसहितं हितम्॥ क्षितिं वा देवलोकं वा गम्यतां यदि रोचते। अप्रमादश्च वः कार्यो ब्रह्म हि प्रचुरच्छलम्॥<br />Hearing these words of his disciples, the powerful son of Parashara, replied them in these wholesome words which were fraught, besides, with virtue and profit.-You may go to the Earth or to the regions of the gods as ye like. You should always be careful, for the Vedas are such that they are always liable to be misunderstood.</p>
<p id='5'>तेऽनुज्ञातास्ततः सर्वे गुरुणा सत्यवादिना। जग्मुः प्रदक्षिणं कृत्वा व्यासं मूर्धाभिवाद्य च॥<br />Permitted by their preceptor of truthful speech, the disciples left him after going round him and bowing their heads to him.</p>
<p id='6'>अवतीर्य महीं तेऽथ चातुर्होत्रमकल्पयन्। संयाजयन्तो विप्रांश्च राजन्यांश्च विशस्तथा॥<br />Descending upon the Earth they celebrated the Agnishtoma and other sacrifices; and they began to officiate at the sacrifices of Brahinanas and Kshatriyas and Vaishyas.</p>
<p id='7'>पूज्यमाना द्विजैर्नित्यं मोदमाना गृहे रताः। याजनाध्यापनरताः श्रीमन्तो लोकविश्रुताः॥<br />Happily spending their days in the domestic mode of life, they were treated by the Brahmanas with great reverence. Possessed of great fame and prosperity, they were engaged in teaching and officiating in sacrifices.</p>
<p id='8'>अवतीर्णेषु शिष्येषु व्यासः पुत्रसहायवान्। तूष्णीं ध्यानपरो धीमानेकान्ते समुपाविशत्।१०।।<br />After his disciples had departed, Vyasa remained in his hermitage, with only his son in his company. Passing his days in anxious thoughtfulness, and great Rishi, endued with wisdom, kept silent, sitting in a retired corner of the asylum.</p>
<p id='9'>तं ददर्शाश्रमपदे नारदः सुमहातपाः। अथैनमब्रवीत् काले मधुराक्षरया गिरा॥<br />At that time Narada of great ascetic merit came there for seeing Vyasa, and addressing him, said these words of sweet sound.</p>
<p id='10'>भो भो ब्रह्मर्षिवासिष्ठ ब्रह्मघोषो न वर्तते। एको ध्यानपरस्तूष्णीं किमास्से चिन्तयन्निव।॥<br />Narada said O twice-born Rishi of Vashistha's family, why are Vedic sounds silent now? Why are you sitting silent and alone, engaged in meditation like one engrossed in thought?</p>
<p id='11'>ब्रह्मघोषैविरहितः पर्वतोऽयं न शोभते। रजसा तमसा चैव सोमः सोपप्लवो यथा॥<br />Alas, destitute of Vedic sound, this mountain has lost its beauty, as the Moon shorn of splendour when possessed by Rahu or covered with dust.</p>
<p id='12'>न भ्राजते यथापूर्वं निषादानामिवालयः। देवर्षिगणजुष्टोऽपि वेदध्वनिनिराकृतः॥<br />Though inhabited by the celestial Rishis, yet shorn of Vedic sounds, the mountain no longer appears beautiful now but resembles a village of Nishadas.</p>
<p id='13'>ऋषयश्च हि देवाश्च गन्धर्वाश्च महौजसः। वियुक्ता ब्रह्मघोषेण न भ्राजन्ते यथा पुरा॥<br />The Rishis, the gods, and the Gandharvas, too, no longer shine as before on account of being deprived of Vedic sound.</p>
<p id='14'>नारदस्य वचः श्रुत्वा कृष्णद्वैपायनोऽब्रवीत्। महर्षे यत् त्वया प्रोक्तं वेदवादविचक्षण॥ एतन्मनोऽनुकूलं मे भवानर्हति भाषितुम्। सर्वज्ञः सर्वदर्शी च सर्वत्र च कुतूहली॥<br />Hearing these words of Narada the Islandborn Krishna answered, saying,-0 Great Rishi, O you who are conversant with the sayings of the Vedas, all that you have said is agreeable to me, and you should say it to me! You are omniscient. You have seen everything. Your curiosity knows all things.</p>
<p id='15'>त्रिषु लोकेषु यद् भूतं सर्वं तव मते स्थितम्। तदाज्ञापय विप्रचे ब्रूहि किं करवाणि ते॥<br />You know everything in the three words. Do you, then, Otwice-born Rishi, order me.0, tell me what I am to do.</p>
<p id='16'>यन्मया समनुष्ठेयं ब्रह्मर्षे तदुदाहर। विमुक्तस्येहं शिष्यैर्मे नातिहृष्टमिदं मनः॥<br />Tell me, O twice-born Rishi, what should now be done by me. Separated from my disciples, my mind has become very dispirited.</p>
<p id='17'>नारद उवाच अनाम्नायमला वेदा ब्राह्मणस्याव्रतं मलम्। मलं पृथिव्या वाहीका: स्त्रीणां कौतूहलं मलम्॥<br />Narada said The fault of the Vedas is the suspension of their recitation. The fault of the Brahmanas is their non-observance of vows. The Vahika race is the stain of the Earth. Curiosity is the fault of women.</p>
<p id='18'>अधीयतां भवान् वेदान् सार्धं पुत्रेण धीमता। विधुन्वन् ब्रह्मघोषेण रक्षाभयकृतं तमः॥<br />Do you with your intelligent son recite the Vedas, and do you with the echoes of Vedic sounds remove the fears of the Rakshasas.</p>
<p id='19'>भीष्म उवाच नारदस्य वचः श्रुत्वा व्यासः परमधर्मवित्। तथेत्युवाच संहृष्टो वेदाभ्यासदृढव्रतः॥<br />Bhishma continued Hearing these words of Narada, Vyasa, the best of all persons knowing duties and firmly devoted to Vedic recitation, became filled with joy and answered Narada, saying,-So be it.</p>
<p id='20'>शुकेन सह पुत्रेण वेदाभ्यासमथाकरोत्। स्वरेणोच्चैः स शैक्ष्येण लोकानापूरयन्निव॥<br />With his son Shuka, be began to recite the Vedas in a loud sweet voice, observing all the rules of ortheopy and, as it were, filling the three worlds with that sound.</p>
<p id='21'>तयोरभ्यसतोरेव नानाधर्मप्रवादिनोः। वातोऽतिमात्रं प्रववौ समुद्रानिलवेजितः॥<br />One day as father and son, who knew well the ordinances of duties, were engaged in reciting the Vedas, a violent wind arose as if moved by the gales that blow on the bosom of the ocean.</p>
<p id='22'>ततोऽनध्याय इति तं व्यासः पुत्रमवारयत्। शुको वारितमात्रस्तु कौतूहलसमन्वितः॥<br />Understanding from this incident that the hour was not suited to sacred recitation, Vyasa immediately ordered his son to stop the recitation. Shuka, thus forbidden by his father, became filled with curiosity.</p>
<p id='23'>अपृच्छत् पितरं ब्रह्मन् कुतो वायुरभूदयम्। आख्यातुमर्हति भवान् वायोः सर्वं विचेष्टितम्॥<br />He asked his father saying,-0 twice-born one, whence is this Wind? You should tell me everything about the conduct of the Wind.</p>
<p id='24'>शुकस्यैतद् वचः श्रुत्वा व्यासः परमविस्मितः। अनध्यायनिमित्तेऽस्मिन्निदं वचनमब्रवीत्॥<br />Hearing this question of Shuka, Vyasa became filled with wonder. He answered Shuka by telling him that that was an omen which showed that the recitation of the Vedas should be stopped.</p>
<p id='25'>दिव्यं ते चक्षुरुत्पन्नं स्वयं ते निर्मलं मनः। तमसा रजसा चापि त्यक्तः सत्त्वे व्यवस्थितः॥<br />You have acquired spiritual vision. Your mind too has, of itself, became purged off all impurities. You have been freed from the qualities of Darkness and Ignorance. You live now in the quality of Goodness.</p>
<p id='26'>आदर्श स्वामिव च्छायां पश्यस्यात्मानमात्मना। व्यस्यात्मनि स्वयं वेदान् बुद्ध्या समनुचिन्तय॥<br />You see now your Soul with your Soul as one sees his own shadow in a mirror. Staying yourself on your own Soul, do you reflect on the Vedas.</p>
<p id='27'>देवयानचरो विष्णोः पितृयाणश्च तामसः। द्वावेतौ प्रेत्य पन्थानौ दिवं चाधश्च गच्छतः॥<br />The path of the Supreme Soul is called the path of the gods. The path that is made up of the quality of Ignorance is called the path of Pitris. These are the two paths in the world hereafter. By one, people go to heaven. By the other people go to hell.</p>
<p id='28'>पृथिव्यामन्तरिक्षे च यत्र संवान्ति वायवः। सप्तैते वायुमार्गा वै तान् निबोधानुपूर्वशः।॥<br />The winds blow, on the Earth's surface and in the sky. There are seven courses in which they blow. Listen to me as I describe them one after another.</p>
<p id='29'>तत्र देवगणाः साध्या महाभूता महाबलाः। तेषामप्यभवत् पुत्रः समानो नाम दुर्जयः॥<br />The body has the senses. The senses are ruled over by the Sadhyas and many great beings of great strength. These gave birth to an invincible son named Samana.</p>
<p id='30'>उदानस्तस्य पुत्रोऽभूद् व्यानस्तस्याभवत् सुतः। अपानश्च ततो ज्ञेयः प्राणश्चापि ततोऽपरः॥<br />From Samana originated a son calle Udana. From Udana originated Vyana. From Vyana arose Apana, and lastly from Apana originated the wind called Prana.</p>
<p id='31'>अनपत्योऽभवत् प्राणो दुर्धर्षः शत्रुतापनः। पृथक् कर्माणि तेषां ते प्रवक्ष्यामि यथातथम्॥<br />That invincible scorcher of all enemies, vis., Prana, became barren. I shall now recite to you the different functions of those winds.</p>
<p id='32'>प्राणिनां सर्वतो वायुश्चेष्टां वर्तयते पृथक्। प्राणनाच्चैव भूतानां प्राण इत्यभिधीयते॥<br />The wind is the root of the various functions of all living creatures, and because living creatures are enabled to live by it, therefore is the wind called Prana (or life).</p>
<p id='33'>प्रेरयत्यभ्रसंघातान् धूमजांचोष्मजांश्च यः। प्रथमः प्रथमे मार्गे प्रवहो नाम योऽनिलः॥ अम्बरे स्नेहमभ्येत्य विद्युयश्च महाद्युतिः।<br />That wind which is the first in the above number and which is known by the name of Pravaha (Samana) drives, along the first course, masses of clouds born of smoke and heat. Passing through the sky, and coming into contact with the water in the clouds, that wind shows itself in effulgence among the darts of lightening.</p>
<p id='34'>आवहो नाम संवाति द्वितीयः श्वसनो नदन्॥ उदयं ज्योतिषां शश्वत् सोमादीनां करोति यः। अन्तर्देहेषु चोदानं यं वदन्ति मनीषिणः॥<br />The second wind, called Avaha blows with a loud noise. It is this wind that make Soma and the other luminaries rise and appear. Within the body that wind is called Udana by the wise.</p>
<p id='35'>यश्चतुर्थ्य: समुद्रेभ्यो वायर्धारयते जलम्। उद्धत्याददते चापो जीमूतेभ्योऽम्बरेऽनिलः॥ योऽद्भिः संयोज्य जीमूतान् पर्जन्याय प्रयच्छति। उद्वहो नाम बंहिष्ठस्तृतीयः स सदागतिः॥<br />That wind which drinks up water from the four oceans, and having sucked it up gives it to the clouds in the sky and which, having given it to the clouds, presents them to the gods of rain, is third in the number and known by the name of Udvaha.</p>
<p id='36'>समूह्यमाना बहुधा येन नीताः पृथग् घनाः। वर्षमोक्षकृतारम्भास्ते भवन्ति घनाघनाः॥ संहता येन चाविद्धा भवन्ति नदतां नदाः। रक्षणार्थाय सम्भूता मेघत्वमुपयान्ति च॥ योऽसौ वहति भूतानां विमानानि विहायसा। चतुर्थः संवहो नाम वायुः स गिरिमर्दनः॥<br />That wind which supports the clouds and divides them into various parts which melts them for pouring rain and once more solidifies them, which is perceived as the sound of roaring clouds, which exists for the preservation of the world by itself assuming the form of the clouds, which carries the cars of all celestials along the sky, is known by the name of Samvaha. The fourth in the number, it is gifted with great strength so that it is capable of rending the very mountains.</p>
<p id='37'>दारुणोत्पातसंचारो नभसः स्तनयित्नुमान्। पञ्चमः स महावेगो विवहो नाम मारुतः॥ येन वेगवता रुग्णा रूक्षेण रुवता नगान्। वायुना सहिता मेघास्ते भवन्ति बलाहकाः॥<br />That wind causes portends of many sorts and creates roaring sounds in the sky. It is known by the name of Vivaha. The fifth wind has great force and speed. It is dry and roots out and breaks down all trees. Existing with it, the clouds are called Valahaka.</p>
<p id='38'>यस्मिन् पारिप्लवा दिव्या वहन्त्यायो विहायसा। पुण्यं चाकाशगङ्गायास्तोयं विष्टभ्य तिष्ठति॥<br />The sixth wind carries all celestial waters in the sky and prevents them from falling down. Keeping the sacred waters of the celestial Ganga, that wind blows preventing them from having a downward course.</p>

<p id='41'>सर्वप्राणभृतां प्राणान् योऽन्तकाले निरस्यति। यस्य वानुवर्तेते मृत्युवैवस्वतावुभौ॥ सम्यगन्वीक्षतां बुद्ध्या शान्तयाध्यात्मनित्यया। ध्यानाभ्यासाभिरामाणां योऽमृतत्वाय कल्पते॥ यं समासाद्य वेगेन दिशोऽन्तं प्रतिपेदिरे। दक्षस्य दशपुत्राणां सहस्राणि प्रजापतेः॥ येन स्पृष्टः पराभूतो यात्येव न निवर्तते। परावहो नाम परो वायुः स दुरतिक्रमः॥<br />That wind which takes away the life of all living creatures when the proper time comes, whose path is followed by Death and Surya's son Yama, which becomes the source of that immortality becomes the source of the immortality which is acquired by the Yogins of subtile sight who are always engaged in Yogameditation, by whose help the thousands of grandsons of Daksha, that lord of creatures, by his ten sons, succeeded in days of yore in reaching the ends of the universe, whose touch enables one to acquire Liberation by freeing himself from the obligation of returning to the world, that wind is called by the name of Paravaha. The foremost of all winds, it cannot be resisted by any body.</p>
<p id='42'>एवमेते दितेः पुत्रा मारुताः परमाद्भुताः। अनारतं ते संवान्ति सर्वगाः सर्वधारिणः॥<br />Wonderful are these winds all of whom are the sons of Diti. Capable of going everywhere and upholding all things, they blow all around you without being attached to you at any time.</p>
<p id='43'>एतत् तु महदाश्चर्यं यदयं पर्वतोत्तमः। कम्पितः सहसा तेन वायुनातिप्रवायता॥<br />This, however, is greatly wonderful, viz., that this foremost of mountains should thus be suddenly shaken by that wind which has begun to below.</p>
