<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>शोकस्थानसहस्राणि भयस्थानशतानि च। दिवसे दिवसे मूढमाविशन्ति न पण्डितम्॥<br />A thousand causes of sorrow, a hundred causes of fear, from day to day, attack one who is shorn of understanding but not one who is endued with wisdom and learning.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>तस्मादनिष्टनाशार्थमितिहासं निबोध मे। तिष्ठते चेद् वशे बुद्धिर्लभते शोकनाशनम्॥<br />Do you, therefore, listen to some old narratives as I recount them to you, for the object of removing your sorrow, If one can subjugate his understanding, he is sure to acquire happiness.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>अनिष्टसम्प्रयोगाच्च विप्रयोगात् प्रियस्य च। मनुष्या मानसैर्दुःखैर्युज्यन्ते स्वल्पबुद्धयः॥<br />By accession of what is undesirable and dissociation from what is agreeable, only men of little intelligence yield to mental sorrow.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>द्रव्येषु समतीतेषु ये गुणास्तान् न चिन्तयेत्। न तानाद्रियमाणस्य स्नेहबन्धः प्रमुच्यते॥<br />When things are passed, one should not grieve, thinking of their merits. He who thinks of such past things with affection can never liberate himself.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>दोषदर्शी भवेत् तत्र यत्र रागः प्रवर्तते। अनिष्टवर्धितं पश्येत् तथा क्षिप्र विरज्यते॥<br />One should always try to find out the faults of those things to which one becomes attached, One should always consider such things to be fraught with much evil, By doing so, one should soon free him therefrom.</p>

Such persons have never to shed tears.</p>

<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>प्रज्ञया मानसं दुःखं हन्याच्छारीरमौषधैः। एतद् विज्ञानसामर्थ्य न बालैः समतामियात्॥<br />Mental sorrow should be destroyed by wisdom; while physical sorrow should be removed by medicines. This is the power of knowledge. One should not, in such matters, act like men of little understandings.</p>

There is no doubt in this that all men show attachment for objects of the senses and that death is considered as disagreeable.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>परित्यजति यो दुःखं सुखं वाप्युभयं नरः। अभ्येति ब्रह्म सोऽत्यन्तं न तं शोचन्ति पण्डिताः।१७।।<br />That man who renounces both joy and sorrow, is said to attain to Brahma. When such a man dies, men of wisdom never indulge in any grief for him.</p>
