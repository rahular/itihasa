From this very narrative of the destruction of Vritra the wish has arisen in my mind of asking you a question.</p>

<p id='6'>अप्रमेयमनाधृष्यं सर्वलोकेषु भारत। तत्र देवो गिरितटे हेमधातुविभूषिते॥<br />That summit was immeasurable in extent and no one could go there. On that mountain summit the divine Mahadeva used to sit shiningly as if on a bed-stead adorned with gold.</p>
<p id='7'>पर्यङ्क इव विभ्राजन्नुपविष्टो बभूव ह। शैलराजसुता चास्य नित्यं पार्वे स्थिता बभौ॥ तथा देवा महात्मानो वसवश्वामितौजसः। तथैव च महात्मानावश्विनौ भिषजां वरौ। तथा वैश्रवणो राजा गुह्यकैरभिसंवृतः॥ यक्षाणामीश्वरः श्रीमान् कैलासनिलयः प्रभुः। उपासन्त महात्मानमुशना च महामुनिः॥ सनत्कुमारप्रमुखास्तथैव च महर्षयः। अङ्गिरःप्रमुखाश्चैव तथा देवर्षयोऽपरे॥ विश्वावसुश्च गन्धर्वस्तथा नारदपर्वतौ। अप्सरोगणसंघाश्च समाजग्मुरनेकशः॥<br />Sitting by his side, the daughter of the king of mountains shone in brilliance.

<p id='8'>ववौ सुखः शिवो वायु नागन्धवहः शुचिः। सर्वर्तुकुसुमोपेताः पुष्पवन्तो द्रुमास्तथा॥<br />A pure and auspicious air carrying various sorts of perfumes, blew there. The trees that stood there were adorned with the flowers of all seasons.</p>
<p id='9'>तथा विद्याधराश्चैव सिद्धाश्चैव तपोधनाः। महादेवं पशुपति पर्युपासन्त भारत॥<br />A large number of Vidyadharas, Siddhas and ascetics, too, O Bharata, went there for waiting upon Mahadeva, that Lord of all creatures.</p>
<p id='10'>भूतानि च महाराज नानारूपधराण्यथ। राक्षसाश्च महारौद्राः पिशाचाश्च महाबलाः॥ बहुरूपधरा हृष्टा नानाप्रहरणोद्यताः। देवस्यानुचरास्तत्र तस्थिरे चानलोपमाः॥<br />Many ghosts also, of various forms and aspects, and many fearful Rakshasas and powerful Pishachas, of various forms, mad with joy, and armed with various sorts of uplifted weapons forming the train of Mahadeva, were there, every one of whom looked like a blazing fire energy.</p>

<p id='14'>कस्यचित् त्वथ कालस्य दक्षो नाम प्रजापतिः। पूर्वोक्तेन विधानेन यक्ष्यमाणोऽन्वपद्यत॥<br />After sometime had gone away, the Prajapati Daksha began to celebrate a sacrifice according to ancient rites.</p>
<p id='15'>ततस्तस्य मखं देवाः सर्वे शक्रपुरोगमाः। गमनाय समागम्य बुद्धिमापेदिरे तदा॥<br />All the gods in a body headed by Sakra, resolved to repair to that sacrifice of Daksha.</p>

<p id='17'>प्रस्थिता देवता दृष्ट्वा शैलराजसुता तदा। उवाच वचनं साध्वी देवं पशुपति पतिम्॥ भगवन् क्वनु यान्त्येते देवाः शक्रपुरोगमाः। ब्रूहि तत्त्वेन तत्त्वज्ञ संशयो मे महानयम्॥<br />Seeing the deities depart, the excellent daughter of the king of mountains, addressed her divine husband, viz., the Lord of all creatures, and said, O illustrious one, who are those gods headed by Shakra going? O you who know the truth, tell me truly, for a great doubt has possessed my mind.</p>

<p id='24'>भीष्म उवाच एवमुक्त्वा तु सा देवी तदा पशुपति पतिम्। तूष्णीभूताभवद् राजन् दह्यमानेन चेतसा॥<br />Bhishma said Having said these words to her consort, the Lord of all creatures, O monarch, the goddess Parvati remained silent, her heart burning the while in grief.</p>
<p id='25'>अथ देव्या मतं ज्ञात्वा हृद्गतं यच्चिकीर्षितम्। स समाज्ञापयामास तिष्ठ त्वमिति नन्दिनम्॥<br />Then, understanding what was in her heart and what her thoughts were (for wiping off that disgrace), Mahadeva addressed Nandi, saying,-Wait here.</p>
<p id='26'>ततो योगबलं कृत्वा सर्वयोगेश्वरेश्वरः। तं यज्ञं स महातेजा भीमैरनुचरैस्तदा।॥ सहसा घातयामास देवदेवः पिनाकधूक्। केचिन्नादानमुञ्चन्त केचिद्धासांश्च चक्रिरे॥ रुधिरेणापरे राजंस्तत्राग्नि समवाकिरन्। केचिद् यूपान् समुत्पाट्य बभ्रमुर्विकृताननाः॥ आस्यैरन्ये चाग्रसन्त तथैव परिचारकान्।<br />Summoning all his Yoga powers, that Lord of all lords of Yoga, that god of gods, that holder of Pinaka, possessed of great energy, quickly proceeded to the place accompanied by all his dreadful followers and destroyed that Sacrifice. Of these followers of his, some yelled, and some laughed terribly, and some, O king, extinguished the fires with blood; and some, having dreadful faces, pulling up the sacrificial stakes, began to whirl them. Others began to devour those that were celebrating the Sacrifices.</p>
<p id='27'>ततः स यज्ञो नृपते वध्यमानः समन्ततः॥ आस्थाय मृगरूपं वै खमेवाभ्यगमत् तदा।<br />Then thus afflicted on every side, that Sacrifice, assumed the form of a deer and tried to fly away through the firmanent.</p>
<p id='28'>तं तु यज्ञं तथारूपं गच्छन्तमुपलभ्य सः॥ धनुरादाय बाणेन तदान्वसरत प्रभुः।<br />Learning that the Sacrifice was running away in that form, the powerful Mahadeva began to pursue him with bow and sorrow.</p>
<p id='29'>ततस्तस्य सुरेशस्य क्रोधादमिततेजसः॥ ललाटात् प्रसृतो घोरः स्वेदबिन्दुर्बभूव ह।<br />On account of the ire which then filled the heart of that foremost of all gods, possessed of matchless energy, a dreadful drop of sweat appeared on his forehead.</p>
<p id='30'>तस्मिन् पतितमात्रे च स्वेदबिन्दौ तदा भुवि॥ प्रादुर्बभूव सुमहानग्निः कालानलोपमः।<br />When the drop of sweat fell down on the Earth, there immediately appeared a blazing fire resembling the conflagration that appears at the end of the cycle.</p>
<p id='31'>तत्र चाजायत तदा पुरुषः पुरुषर्षभ॥ ह्रस्वोऽतिमात्रं रक्ताक्षो हरिश्मश्रुर्विभीषणः।<br />From that fire came out a dreadful being, O king of very short stature, having blood-red cyes and a green beard.</p>
<p id='32'>उर्ध्व केशोऽतिरोमाङ्ग श्येनोलूकस्तथैव च॥ करालकृष्णवर्णश्च रक्तवासास्तथैव च। तं यज्ञं सुमहासत्त्वोऽदहत् कक्षमिवानलः॥<br />His body was covered all over with hair like a hawk's or an owl's and his hair stood erect. Of dreadful form, his complexion was dark and his dress blood-red. Like a fire burning a heap of dry grass or straw, that Being of high energy speedily consumed the embodied form of Sacrifice.</p>
<p id='33'>व्यचरत् सर्वतो देवान् प्राद्रवत् स ऋषींस्तथा। देवाश्चाप्याद्रवन् सर्वे ततो भीता दिशो दश॥ तेन तस्मिन् विचरता पुरुषेण विशाम्पते। पृथिवी ह्यचलद् राजन्नतीव भरतर्षभ।॥<br />Having performed that feat, he then rushed towards the gods and the Rishis that had gathered there. The gods filled with fear, fled on all sides. The earth shook with that Being's tread, O King, O foremost of Bharata's race.</p>
<p id='34'>हाहाभूतं जगत् सर्वमुपलक्ष्य तदा प्रभुः। पितामहो महादेवं दर्शयन् प्रत्यभाषत॥<br />Exclamation of 'Oh' and 'Alas' arose throughout the universe. Marking this, the before powerful Grandfather, appearing Mahadeva, addressed him thus.</p>

<p id='37'>यश्चैष पुरुषो जात: स्वेदात् ते विबुधोत्तम। ज्वरो नामैष धर्मज्ञ लोकेषु प्रचरिष्यति॥<br />This Being, also, that has originated from your sweat, O foremost of gods, shall walk among creatures, O righteous-souled one, under the name of Fever.</p>
<p id='38'>एकीभूतस्य न त्वस्य धारणे तेजसः प्रभो। समर्था सकला पृथ्वी बहुधा सृज्यतामयम्॥<br />O powerful one, if the energy of this Being remains intact, then the entire Earth herself will not be able to bear him. Let him, therefore, be divided into many parts.</p>
<p id='39'>इत्युक्तो ब्रह्मणा देवो भागे चापि प्रकल्पिते। भगवन्तं तथेत्याह ब्रह्माणममितौजसम्॥<br />When Brahman had said these words, and when his proper share was appointed of the sacrificial offerings, Mahadeva replied to the Grandfather of great energy, saying,-So be it.</p>
<p id='40'>परां च प्रीतिमगमदुत्स्मयंश्च पिनाकधृक्। अवाप च तदा भागं यथोक्तं ब्रह्मणा भवः॥<br />Indeed, the holder of Pinaka, viz., Bhava, smiled and became filled with joy. And he accepted the share that the Grandfather settled the offerings in sacrifices.</p>
<p id='41'>ज्वरं च सर्वधर्मज्ञो बहुधा व्यसृजत् तदा। शान्त्यर्थं सर्वभूतानां शृणु तच्चापि पुत्रक॥<br />Knowing the constituents of everything, Mahadeva then divided. Fever into many parts, for the peace of all creatures. Listen, O son, as how he did this.</p>
<p id='42'>शीर्षाभितापो नागानां पर्वतानां शिलाजतु। अपां तु नीलिका विद्यान्निर्मोकं भुजगेषु च॥ खोरकः सौरभेयाणामूषरं पृथिवीतले। पशूनामपि धर्मज्ञ दृष्टिप्रत्यवरोधनम्॥ रन्ध्रागतमथाश्वानां शिखो दश्च बर्हिणाम्। नेत्ररोगः कोकिलस्य ज्वरः प्रोक्तो महात्मना॥<br />The heat in the heads of elephants, the bitumen of mountains, the moss that floats on water, the slough of snakes, the sores that appear in the hoofs of bulls, the barren tracts of Earth full of saline matter, the dullness of vision of all animals, the diseases in the throats of horses, the crests appearing on the heads of peacocks, the eye-disease of the koel, each of these was named Fever by the great Mahadeva.</p>
<p id='43'>अवीनां पित्तभेदश्च सर्वेषामिति नः श्रुतम्। शुकानामपि सर्वेषां हिक्किका प्रोच्यते ज्वरः॥ शार्दूलेष्वथ धर्मज्ञ श्रमो ज्वर इहोच्यते।<br />This is what we have heard. The liverdisease also of sheep, and the hiccup of parrots are also known as forms of Fever. To this must be added the toil that tigers suffer, for that also, O righteous king, is known as a forms of Fever.</p>
<p id='44'>मानुषेषु तु धर्मज्ञ ज्वरो नामैष भारत॥ मरणे जन्मनि तथा मध्ये चाविशते नरम्।<br />Besides these, O Bharata, amongst men, Fever, enters all bodies at the time of birth, of death, and on other occasions.</p>
<p id='45'>एतन्माहेश्वरं तेजो ज्वरो नाम सुदारुणः॥ नमस्यश्चैव मान्यश्च सर्वप्राणिभिरीश्वरः।<br />This Fever is known to be the dreadful power of Maheshvara. He has authority over all creatures and should, therefore, be respected and adored by all.</p>
<p id='46'>अनेन हि समाविष्टो वृत्रो धर्मभृतां वरः॥ व्यजृभत ततः शक्रस्तस्मै वज्रमवासृजत्।<br />It was by him that Vritra, that foremost of virtuous persons, was possessed when he yawned. It was then that Shakra discharged his thunderbolt at him.</p>
<p id='47'>प्रविश्य वज्रं वृत्रं च दारयामास भारत॥ दारितश्च स वज्रेण महायोगी महासुरः। जगाम परमं स्थानं विष्णोरमिततेजसः॥<br />The thunderbolt, entering the body of Vritra, O Bharata, divided him in two parts. Divided in two by the thunderbolt, the great Asura endued with great Yoga powers, went to the region of Vishnu of great energy.</p>
<p id='48'>विष्णुभक्त्या हि तेनेदं जगद् व्याप्तमभूत् तदा। तस्माच्च निहतो युद्धे विष्णोः स्थानमवाप्तवान्॥<br />It was on account of his devotion to Vishnu that he had succeeded in overwhelming the whole universe. And it was owing to his devotion to Vishnu that he ascended, when killed, to the region of Vishnu.</p>

<p id='50'>इमां ज्वरोत्पत्तिमदीनमानसः पठेत् सदा यः सुसमाहितो नरः। विमुक्तरोगः स सुखी मुदा युतो लभेत कामान् स यथामनीषितान्॥<br />That man who will read this account of the origin of Fever with rapt attention and cheerful heart shall become free from disease and shall always have happiness for his lot.
