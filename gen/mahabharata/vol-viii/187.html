<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 360</h3><h4>The story of the Naga king Padma</h4><p id='1'>नाग उवाच अथ ब्राह्मणरूपेण कं तं समनुपश्यसि। मानुषं केवलं विप्रं देवं वाथ शुचिस्मिते॥<br />The Naga said O you of sweet smiles, for whom have you taken that Brahmana? Is he really a human being or is he some god that has come here in the disguise of a Brahmana?</p>
<p id='2'>को हि मां मानुषः शक्तो द्रष्टकामो यशस्विनि। संदर्शनरुचिर्वाक्यमाज्ञापूर्वं वदिष्यति॥<br />O you of great fame, who is there ainong men who would be desirous of seeing are or that would be competent for the purpose? Can a human being, desiring to see me, leave such a command with you about sending me to him for paying him a visit at the place where he is living?</p>
<p id='3'>सुरासुरगणानां च देवर्षीणां च भाविनि। ननु नागा महावीर्याः सौरसेयास्तरस्विनः॥<br />Amongst the gods and Asuras and celestial Rishis, O amiable lady, the Nagas are endued with great energy. Having great speed, they are endued again with excellent fragrance.</p>
<p id='4'>वन्दनीयाश्च वरदा वयमप्यनुयायिनः। मनुष्याणां विशेषेण नावेक्ष्या इति मे मतिः॥<br />They derseve to be adored. They are capable of granting boons. Indeed, we too deserve to be followed by others. I tell you, O lady, that we cannot be seen by human beings.</p>
<p id='5'>नागभार्योवाच आर्जवेन विजानामि नासौ देवोऽनिलाशन। एकं तस्मिन् विजानामि भक्तिमानतिरोषण॥<br />Judging by his simplicity and candour I know that that Brahmana is not any god who lives on air. O you of great anger, I also know this, viz., that he respects you with all his heart.</p>
<p id='6'>स हि कार्यान्तराकाङ्क्षी जलेप्सुः स्तोकको यथा। वर्ष वर्षप्रियः पक्षी दर्शनं तव कासति॥<br />He seeks the accomplishment of some object that depends upon your help. As the bird called Chataka, which if fond of rain, waits in earnest expectation of a shower, so is that Brahmana waiting is expectation of a meeting with you.</p>
<p id='7'>हित्वा त्वद्दर्शनं किंचिद् विनं न प्रतिपालयेत्। तुल्यऽप्याभिजने जातो न कश्चित् पर्युपासते॥<br />Let no calamity befall him on account of his inability to obtain a sight of you. No person born like you in a respectable family can be considered to remain respectable by neglecting a guest arrived at his house.</p>
<p id='8'>तद्रोषं सहजं त्यक्त्वा त्वमेनं द्रष्टुमर्हसि। आशाच्छेदेन तस्याद्य नात्मानं दग्धुमर्हसि॥<br />Renouncing that anger which is natural to you, you should go and see that Brahmana. You should not allows yourself to be consumed by disappointing that Brahmana.</p>
<p id='9'>आशया ह्यभिपन्नानामकृत्वाचप्रमार्जनम्। राजा वा राजपुत्रो वा भ्रूणहत्यैव युज्यते॥<br />The king or the prince, by refusing to wipe the tears of persons who come to him from hopes of relief, commits the sin of foeticide. By abstaining from speech one acquire wisdom.</p>
<p id='10'>मौने ज्ञानफलावाप्तिर्दानेन च यशो महत्। वाग्मित्वं सत्यवाक्येन परत्र च महीयते॥<br />By practising gifts one acquires great fame. By observing truthfulness of speech, one acquire the fit of eloquence and comes to be respected in heaven.</p>
<p id='11'>भूप्रदानेन च गतिं लभत्याश्रमसम्मिताम्। न्याय्यस्यार्थस्य सम्प्राप्तिं कृत्वा फलमुपाश्नुते॥<br />By giving away land one acquires that high end which is ordained for Rishis leading the sacred mode of life. By acquiring riches through fair means one succeeds in acquiring many desirable fruits.</p>
<p id='12'>अभिप्रेतामसंश्लिष्टां कृत्वा चात्महितां क्रियाम्। न याति निरयं कश्चिदिति धर्मविदो विदुः॥<br />By doing in full what is good for oneself, one can avoid going to hell. This is what the righteous say.</p>
<p id='13'>नाग उवाच अभिमानैर्न मानो मे जातिदोषेण वै महान्। रोषः संकल्पजः साध्वि दग्धो वागग्निना त्वया॥<br />The Naga said I had no arrogance. On account, however, of my birth, my pride was considerable. Of anger which is born of desire, O blessed lady, I have none. It has all been consumed by the fire of your excellent instructions.</p>
<p id='14'>न च रोषादहं साध्वि पश्येयमधिकं तमः। तस्य वक्तव्यतां यान्ति विशेषेण भुजङ्गमाः॥<br />I do not see, O blessed lady, any darkness that is thicker than anger. On account, however of the Nagas having excess of anger, they have become objects of reproach with all persons.</p>
<p id='15'>रोषस्य हि वशं गत्वा दशग्रीवः प्रतापवान्। तथा शक्रप्रतिस्पर्धी हतो रामेण संयुगे॥<br />By yielding to the influence of anger, the ten-headed Ravan of great prowess, became the rival Shakra and was for that reason killed by Rama in battle.</p>
<p id='16'>अन्तःपुरगतं वत्सं श्रुत्वा रामेण निर्हतम्। धर्षणारोषसंविग्नाः कार्तवीर्यसुता हताः॥<br />Hearing that the Rishi Rama of Bhrigu's race had entered the inner apartments of their palace for bringing away the calf of the Homa cow of his father, the sons of Karttavirya, yielding to anger, took such entry as an insult to their royal house, and as the result thereof, they met with destruction at the hands of Rama.</p>
<p id='17'>जामदग्न्येन रामेण सहस्रनयनोपमः। संयुगे निहतो रोषात् कार्तवीर्यो महाबलः॥<br />Indeed, Karttavirya of great strength, resembling the thousand-eyed Indra himself, on account of his having yielded to anger, was killed in battle by Rama of Jamadagni's race.</p>
<p id='18'>तदेष तपसां शत्रुः श्रेयसां विनिपातकः। निगृहीतो मया रोषः श्रुत्वैवं वचनं तव॥<br />Verily, O amiable lady, at your words I have controlled my anger, that enemy of penances, that destroyer of all that is beneficial for himself.</p>
<p id='19'>आत्मानं च विशेषेण प्रशंसाम्यनपायिनी। यस्य मे त्वं विशालाक्षि भार्या गुणसमन्विता॥<br />I praise my own self greatly since, O largeeyed one, I am fortunate enough to have you as my wife,-you who are possessed of every virtue and who have inexhaustible merits.</p>
<p id='20'>एष तत्रैव गच्छामि यत्र तिष्ठत्यसौ द्विजः। सर्वथा चोक्तवान् वाक्यं स कृतार्थः प्रयास्यति॥<br />I shall now proceed to that spot where the Brahmana is living. I shall certainly address that Brahmana in proper words, and he shall certainly go hence, his wishes being done.</p>
