<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 327</h3><h4>The study of Self by Self</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच एतच्छ्रुत्वा तु वचनं कृतात्मा कृतनिश्चयः। आत्मनाऽऽत्मानमास्थाय दृष्ट्वा चात्मानमात्मना।॥<br />Bhishma said Having heard these words of king Janaka, Shuka of purified soul and settled conclusions began to stay in his Soul by his Soul, having of course seen Self by Self.</p>
<p id='2'>कृतकार्यः सुखी शान्तस्तूष्णीं प्रायादुदङ्मुख। शैशिरं गिरिमुद्दिश्य सधर्मा मातरिश्वनः॥ एतस्मिन्नेव काले तु देवर्षि रदस्तथा।<br />His object being fulfilled he became happy and tranquil, and without further questioning Janaka, he proceeded northwards to the mountains of Himavat with the speed of the wind and like the wind.</p>
<p id='3'>हिमवन्तमियाद् द्रष्टुं सिद्धचारणसेवितम्॥ तमप्सरोगणाकीर्णं शान्तस्वननिनादितम्। किन्नराणां सहस्रैश्च भृङ्गराजैस्तथैव च॥ मद्गुभिः खजरीटैच विचित्रैर्जीवजीवकैः॥ चित्रवर्णैर्मयूरैश्च केकाशतविराजितैः।<br />Those mountains were full of various clans of Apsaras and echoed with many soft sounds. Filled with thousands of Kinnaras and Bhringarajas, it was adorned, besides, with many Madgus and Khanjaritas and many Jivajivakas of variegated colour. And there were many peacocks also of gorgeous hues, uttering their shrill but melodious cries.</p>
<p id='4'>राजहंससमूहैश्च कृष्णैः परभृतैस्तथा॥ पक्षिराजो गरुत्मांश्च यं नित्यमधितिष्ठति।<br />Many bevies of swans also, and many flights of gladdened coils, too, adorned the place. The king of birds, viz., Garuda, live on that suimit constantly.</p>
<p id='5'>चत्वारो लोकपालाश्च देवाः सर्षिगणास्तथा॥ तत्र नित्यं समायान्ति लोकस्य हितकाम्यया।<br />The four Regents of the world, the gods, and various classes of Rishis, used always to come there from desire of doing good to the world.</p>
<p id='6'>विष्णुना यत्र पुत्रार्थे तपस्तप्तं महात्मना॥ तत्रैव च कुमारेण बाल्ये क्षिप्ता दिवौकसः।<br />It was there that the great Vishnu had practised the severest penances for the object of getting a son.</p>
<p id='7'>शक्तिय॑स्ता क्षितितले त्रैलोक्यमवमन्य वै॥ तत्रोवाच जगत् स्कन्दः क्षिपन् वाक्यमिदं तदा। योऽन्योऽस्ति मत्तोऽभ्यधिको विप्रा यस्याधिकं प्रियाः।। यो ब्रह्मण्यो द्वितीयोऽस्ति त्रिषु लोकेषु वीर्यवान्। साऽभ्युद्धरत् त्विमां शक्तिमथवा कम्पयत्विति॥ तच्छ्रुत्वा व्यथिता लोकाः क इमामुद्धरेदिति।<br />It was there that the commander-in-chief of the gods named Kumara, in his younger days, disregarding the three worlds with all the inhabitants, threw down his dart, piercing the Earth therewith. Throwing down his dart, Skanda, addressing the universe, said, If there be any person who is superior to me in might, or who holds Brahmanas to be dearer, or who can equal me in devotion to the Brahmanas and the Vedas, or who is endued with energy like me, let him draw up this dart or at least shake it!-Hearing this challenge, the three worlds became stricken with anxiety, and all creatures asked one another, saying-who will raise this dart?</p>
<p id='8'>अथ देवगणं सर्वं सम्भ्रान्तेन्द्रियमानसम्॥ अपश्यद् भगवान् विष्णुः क्षिप्तं सासुरराक्षसम्। किं त्वत्र सुकृतं कार्यं भवेदिति विचिन्तयन्॥ अनामृष्य ततः क्षेपमवैक्षत च पावकिम्।<br />Vishnu saw all the gods and Asuras and Rakshasas to be greatly troubled in mind. He thought of what should be done under the circumstances. Without being able to bear that challenge regarding the hurling of the dart, he directed his eyes towards Skanda, the son of the Fire-god.</p>
<p id='9'>सम्प्रगृह्य विशुद्धात्मा शक्तिं प्रज्वलितां तदा॥ कम्पयामास सव्येन पाणिना पुरुषोत्तमः।<br />The pure Vishnu caught hold of the burning dart with his left hand, and began to shake it.</p>
<p id='10'>शक्त्यां तु कम्प्यमानायां विष्णुना बलिना तदा॥ मेदिनी कम्पिता सर्वा सशैलवनकानना।<br />When the dart was being thus shaken by the highly powerful Vishnu, the whole Earth with her mountains, forests, and seas, shook with the dart.</p>
<p id='11'>शक्तेनापि समुद्धर्तुं कम्पिता साभवत् तदा॥ रक्षिता स्कन्दराजस्य धर्षणा प्रभविष्णुना।<br />Although Vishnu was fully capable to raise the dart, still he contented himself with only shaking it. In this, the powerful lord only kept the honour of Skanda intact.</p>
<p id='12'>तां कम्पयित्वा भगवान् प्रह्लादमिदमब्रवीत्॥ पश्य वीर्यं कुमारस्य नैतदन्यः करिष्यति।<br />Having shaken it himself, the divine Vishnu, addressing Prahlada, said,-see the might of Kumara! None else in the universe can raise this dart.</p>
<p id='13'>सोऽमृष्यमाणस्तद्वाक्यं समुद्धरणनिश्चितः॥ जग्राह तां तदा शक्तिं न चैनां न व्यकम्पयत्।<br />Unable to bear this, Prahlada determined to raise the dart. He caught it, but was unable to shake it at all.</p>
<p id='14'>नादं महान्तं मुक्त्वा स मूछितो गिरिमूर्धनि॥ विह्वल: प्रापतद् भूमौ हिरण्यकशिपोः सुतः।<br />Uttering a loud cry, he dropped down on the hill-top in a swoon. Indeed, the son of Hiranyakashipu dropped down on the Earth.</p>
<p id='15'>तत्रोत्तरां दिशं गत्वा शैलराजस्य पार्श्वतः॥ तपोऽतप्यत दुर्धर्षं तात नित्यं वृषध्वजः।<br />Going towards the northern side of those grand mountains, Mahadeva, having the bull for his emblem, had practised the austerest penances.</p>
<p id='16'>पावकेन परिक्षिप्तं दीप्यता यस्य चाश्रमम्॥ आदित्यपर्वतं नाम दुर्धर्षमकृतात्मभिः।<br />The asylum where Mahadeva had practised those austerities is encompassed on all sides with a burning fire. Unapproachable by person of impure souls, that mountain is known by the name of Aditya.</p>
<p id='17'>न तत्र शक्यते गन्तुं यक्षराक्षसदानवैः॥ दशयोजनविस्तारमग्निज्वालासमावृतम्।<br />There is a fiery girdle all around it, of ten Yojanas in width and it is incapable of being approached by Yakshas and Rakshasas and Danavas.</p>
<p id='18'>भगवान् पावकस्तत्र स्वयं तिष्ठति वीर्यवान्॥ सर्वान् विघ्नान् प्रशमयन् महादेवस्य धीमतः। दिव्यं वर्षसहस्रं हि पादेनैकेन तिष्ठतः॥<br />The illustrious God of Fire, endued with mighty energy, lives there in embodied form engaged in removing all obstacles from the side of Mahadeva of great wisdom who remained there for thousand celestial years, standing on one foot.</p>
<p id='19'>देवान् संतापयंस्तत्र महादेवो महाव्रतः। ऐन्द्रीं तु दिशमास्थाय शैलराजस्य धीमतः॥<br />Living on the side of that foremost of mountains, Mahadeva of great vows scorched the gods greatly.</p>
<p id='20'>विविक्ते पर्वततटे पाराशर्यो महातपाः। वेदानध्यापयामास व्यास: शिष्यान् महामतिः॥<br />At the foot of those mountains, in a retired spot, Parashara's son of great ascetic merit, viz., Vyasa, taught the Vedas to his disciples.</p>
<p id='21'>सुमन्तुं च महाभागं वैशम्पायनमेव च। जैमिनि च महाप्राज्ञं पैलं चापि तपस्विनम्॥<br />Those disciples were the highly blessed Sumanta, Vaishampayana, Jaimini of great wisdom, and Paila of great ascetic merit.</p>
<p id='22'>यत्र शिष्यैः परिवृतो व्यास आस्ते महातपाः। तत्राश्रमपदं रम्यं ददर्श पितुरुत्तमम्।<br />Shuka went to that charming asylum where his father, the great ascetic Vyasa, was living surrounded by his disciples.</p>
<p id='23'>आरणेयो विशुद्धात्मा नभसीव दिवाकरः। अथ व्यास: परिक्षिप्तं ज्वलन्तमिव पावकम्॥ ददृशे सुतमायान्तं दिवाकरसमप्रभम्।<br />Seated in his asylum, Vyasa saw his son approach like a burning fire of scattered flames, or resembling the Sun himself in effulgence.</p>
<p id='24'>असज्जमा वृक्षेषु शैलेषु विषयेषु च। योगयुक्तं महात्मानं यथा बाणं गुणच्युतम्।॥<br />As Shuka approached, he did not seem to touch the trees or the rocks of the mountain. Perfectly dissociated from all objects of the senses, and engaged in Yoga, the great ascetic came, resembling in speed an arrow shot off a bow.</p>
<p id='25'>सोऽभिगम्य पितुः पादावगृह्णादरणीसुतः। यथोपजोषं तैश्चापि समागच्छन्महामुनिः॥<br />Born on the fire-sticks, Shuka approaching his father, touched his feet. With due formalities he then accosted the disciples of his father.</p>
<p id='26'>ततो निवेदयामास पित्रे सर्वमशेषतः। शुको जनकराजेन संवादं प्रीतमानसः॥<br />With great cheerfulness he then described in full to his father all the particulars of his conversation with king Janaka.</p>
<p id='27'>एवमध्यापयशिष्यान् व्यासः पुत्रं च वीर्यवान्। उवास हिमवत्पृष्ठे पाराशर्यो महामुनिः॥<br />After the arrival of his powerful son, Vyasa, the son of Parashara, continued to live there on the Himavat, engaged in teaching his disciples, and his son.</p>
<p id='28'>ततः कदाचिच्छिष्यास्तं परिवार्यावतस्थिरे। वेदाध्ययनसम्पन्नाः शान्तात्मानो जितेन्द्रियाः॥<br />One day as he was seated his disciples, all well-read in the Vedas, having their senses under control, and gifted with tranquil souls, sat themselves around him.</p>
<p id='29'>वेदेषु निष्ठां सम्प्राप्य साङ्गेष्वपि तपस्विनः। अथोचुस्ते तदा व्यासं शिष्याः प्राञ्जलयो गुरुम्॥<br />All of them had perfectly mastered the Vedas with their branches. All of them were observant of penances. With joined hands they addressed their preceptor in the following words.</p>
<p id='30'>शिष्या ऊचुः महता तेजसा युक्ता यशसा चापि वर्धिताः। एकं त्विदानीमिच्छामो गुरुणानुग्रहं कृतम्॥<br />We have, through your favour, been ended with great energy. Our fame, also has spread. There is one favour that we pray you to grant us.</p>
<p id='31'>इति तेषां वचः श्रुत्वा ब्रह्मर्षिस्तानुवाच हा उच्यतामिति तद् वत्सा यद् वः कार्यं प्रियं मया॥<br />Hearing these words of theirs, the twiceborm Rishi answered them, saying,-You sons, tell me what that boon is which you want me to grant you.</p>
<p id='32'>एतद् वाक्यं गुरोः श्रुत्वा शिष्यास्ते हष्टमानसाः। पुनः प्राञ्जलयो भूत्वा प्रणम्य शिरसा गुरुम्॥ ऊचुस्ते सहिता राजन्निदं वचनमुत्तमम्। यदि प्रीत उपाध्यायो धन्याः स्मो मुनिसत्तम॥<br />Hearing this answer of their preceptor, the disciples became filled with joy. Bending their heads once more low to their preceptor, and joining their hands, all of them simultaneously, said, O king, these excellent words: If our preceptor has been gratified with us, then, O best of sages, we are sure to be successful.</p>
<p id='33'>काङ्क्षामस्तु वयं सर्वे वरं दातुं महर्षिणा। षष्ठः शिष्यो न ते ख्यातिं गच्छेदत्र प्रसीद नः॥<br />We all solicit you, O great Rishi, to grant us a boon. Do you show us favour. Let no sixth disciple succeed in acquiring fame.</p>
<p id='34'>चत्वारस्ते वयं शिष्या गुरुपुत्रश्च पञ्चमः। इह वेदाः प्रतिष्ठेरन्नेषः नः कासितो वरः॥<br />We are four. Our preceptor's son forms the fifth. Let the Vedas shine in only us five! This is the boon that we pray for.</p>
<p id='35'>शिष्याणां वचनं श्रुत्वा व्यासो वेदार्थतत्त्ववित्। पराशरात्मजो धीमान् परलोकार्थचिन्तकः॥ उवाच शिष्यान् धर्मात्मा धन॑ नैःश्रेयसं वचः। ब्राह्मणाय सदा देयं ब्रह्म शुश्रूषवे तथा॥<br />Hearing these words of his disciples, Vyasa, the son of Parashara, endued with great intelligence, well conversant with the meanings of the Vedas, endued with a pious soul, and always engaged in thinking of objects that grant benefits on a person in the next world, said to his disciples these righteous words, fraught with great benefit:-The Vedas should always be given to him, who is a Brahmana, or to him who is desirous of listening to Vedic instructions, by him who eagerly wishes to acquire a residence in the region of Brahman.</p>
<p id='36'>ब्रह्मलोके निवासं यो ध्रुवं समभिकासते। भवन्तो बहुलाः सन्तु वेदो विस्तार्यतामयम्॥<br />Do ye multiply. Let the Vedas spread. The Vedas should never be given to one who has not formally become a disciple. Nor should they be given to one who does not observe good vows. Nor should they be given to one who is of one impure soul.</p>
<p id='37'>नाशिष्ये सम्प्रदातव्यो नाव्रते नाकृतात्मनि। एते शिष्यगुणा: सर्वे विज्ञातव्या यथार्थतः॥<br />These should be known as the proper accomplishments of persons who can be accepted as disciples. No science should be given to one without a proper examination of one's character.</p>
<p id='38'>नापरीक्षितचारित्रे विद्या देया कथंचन। यथा हि कनकं शुद्धं तापच्छेदनिकर्षणैः॥<br />As pure gold is tested by heat, cutting, and rubbing, similarly disciples should be tested by their birth and accomplishments.</p>
<p id='39'>परीक्षेत तथा शिष्यानीक्षेत् कुलगुणादिभिः। न नियोज्याश्च वः शिष्या अनियोगे महाभये॥<br />You should never give disciples tasks to which they should not be set, or tasks which are full of dangers. One's knowledge is always proportionate to his understanding and diligence in study.</p>
<p id='40'>यथामति यथापाठं तथा विद्या फलिष्यति। सर्वस्तरतु दुर्गाणि सर्वो भद्राणि पश्यतु॥ श्रावयेच्चतुरो वर्णान् कृत्वा ब्राह्मणमग्रतः।<br />Let all disciples master all difficulties, and let all of them be crowned with success. You are competent to expound the scriptures to persons of all the castes. Only ye should, while delivering instructions address a Brahmana, first of all.</p>
<p id='41'>वेदस्याध्ययनं हीदं तच्च कार्यं महत् स्मृतम्॥ स्तुत्यर्थमिह देवानां वेदाः सृष्टाः स्वयम्भुवा।<br />These are the rules about the study of the Vedas. This again is considered as a high task. The Vedas were created by the Self-create for the purpose of praising the gods therewith.</p>
<p id='42'>यो निर्वदेत सम्मोहाद् ब्राह्मणं वेदपारगम्॥ सोऽभिध्यानाद् ब्राह्मणस्य पराभूयाद संशयम्।<br />That man who, through stupefaction of intellect, speaks ill of a Brahmana well-read in the Vedas, is certain to meet with humiliation on account of such evil-speaking.</p>
<p id='43'>यश्चाधर्मेण विब्रूयाद् यश्चाधर्मेण पृच्छति॥ तयोरन्यतरः प्रति विद्वेषं चाधिगच्छति।<br />He who, disregarding all rules of virtue, seeks knowledge, and he who, disregarding the rules of virtue, communicates knowledge, both of them fall off and instead of that love which should exist instead of that love which should exist between preceptor and disciple, such questioning and such communication are sure to create distrust and suspicion.</p>
<p id='44'>एतद् वः सर्वमाख्यातं स्वाध्यायस्य विधिं प्रति। उपकुर्याच्च शिष्याणामेतच्च हृदि वो भवेत्॥<br />I have now told you everything about the way in which the Vedas should be studied and taught. You should treat your disciples thus, remembering these instructions.”</p>
