Indeed, with his whole soul he gave himself up to Narayana.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>प्रोष्य वर्षसहस्रं तु नरनारायणाश्रमे। श्रुत्वा भगवदाख्यानं दृष्ट्वा च हरिमव्ययम्॥ हिमवन्तं जगामाशु यत्रास्य स्वक आश्रमः।<br />Having lived for a full thousand years in the hermitage of Nara and Narayana, having seen the immutable Hari, and heard the excellent discourse having Narayana for its theme, the celestial Rishi went to his own hermitage on the breast of Himavat.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>तावपि ख्याततपसौ नरनारायणावृषी॥ तस्मिन्नेवाश्रमे रम्ये तेपतुस्तप उत्तमम्।<br />Those foremost of ascetics, viz., Nara and Narayana, however, continued to live in their charming hermitage of Vadari, practising the severest austerities.</p>

Who else than he, O foremost of kings, could compile such a work as the Mahabharata? Who else than that powerful Rishi could describe the diverse kinds of duties and religion for the। observance and adoption of men.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>वर्ततां ते महायज्ञो यथा संकल्पितस्त्वया। संकल्पिताश्वमेधस्त्वं श्रुतधर्मश्च तत्त्वतः॥<br />You are bent upon celebrating a great sacrifice.

<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>स हि परमगुरुर्जनभुवनपतिः पृथुधरणिधरः श्रुतिविनयनिधिः। स्तव भवतु गतिर्हरिरमरहितः॥<br />The Supreme god Narayana is the Lord of all the foremost of Rishis, and of the three worlds. He is the upholder of Earth herself of huge proportions. He is the receptacle of the Shruti's and of the quality of humility. He is the great receptacle of all those ordinances that should be practised for acquiring tranquillity of heart, as also of all those who go by the name of Yama. He is always accompanied by the foremost of twice-born ones. Let that great god be your refuge.</p>

He is endued with four-fold form. He shares the merits originating from the dedication of tanks and the observance of similar religious rites. Undefeated and gifted with great power, it is He who always ordains the end, approachable by the Soul alone, of Rishis of pious deeds.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>तं लोकसाक्षिणमजं पुरुशं पुराणं रविवर्णमीश्वरं गतिं बहुशः। प्रणमध्वमेकमनसो यतः सलिलोद्भवोऽपि तमृषि प्रणतः॥<br />He is the witness of the worlds. He is unborn.
