<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 308</h3><h4>The Supreme Soul and the Individual Soul</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>वसिष्ठ उवाच अथ बुद्धमथाबुद्धमिमं गुणविधिं शृणु। आत्मानं बहुधा कृत्वा तान्येव प्रविचक्षते॥<br />Vashishtha said Listen now to me as I describe to you the Buddha (Enlightened to the Supreme Self) and Abuddha (Individual Soul) which is the dispensation of the qualities, Assuming many forms the Supreme Soul, becoming Individual Soul, regards all those forms as real.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>एतदेवं विकुर्वाणो बुध्यमानो न बुध्यते। गुणान् धारयते ह्येष सृजत्याक्षिपते तदा॥<br />On account of such transformations Individual Soul fails to understand the Supreme Soul, for he has the three qualities and creates and withdraws into himself what he creates.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>अजस्रं त्विह क्रीडार्थं विकरोति जनाधिप। अव्यक्तबोधनाच्चैव बुध्यमानं वदन्त्यपि॥<br />Carelessly for his sport, O king, does Individual Soul undergo changes and because he is capable of understanding the called action of the Unmanifest, therefore he is the Comprehender.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>न त्वेव बुध्यतेऽव्यक्तं सगुणं तात निर्गुणम्। कदाचित् त्वेव खल्वेतदाहुरप्रतिबुद्धकम्॥<br />The Unmanifest or Nature can at no time comprehend Brahma which is really without qualities even when it shows itself with qualities. Hence is Nature called Unintelligent.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>बुध्यते यदि वाक्यक्तमेतद् वै पञ्चविंशकम्। बुध्यमानो भवत्येव सङ्गात्मक इति श्रुतिः। अनेनाप्रतिबुद्धेति वदन्त्यव्यक्तमच्युतम्॥ अव्यक्तबोधनाच्चापि बुध्यमानं वदन्त्युत।<br />There is a declaration of the Shrutis that is ever Nature does succeed in knowing the twenty fifth, she then becomes at one with the Individual Soul who is united with her. On account of this Individual Soul or Purusha, who is not manifest and which in his real nature is not subject to changes, comes to be called as the Unawakened or Ignorant.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>पञ्चविंशं महात्मानं न चासावपि बुध्यते॥ षड्विशं विमलं बुद्धमप्रमेयं सनातनम्। स तु तं पञ्चविंशं च चतुर्विंशं च बुध्यते॥<br />Indeed, because the twenty-fifth can comprehend the Unmanifest, he is, therefore, called Comprehender. He cannot, however readily, comprehened the twenty-sixth, which is pure, which is Knowledge without duality, which is immeasurable, and which is eternal. The twenty-sixth, however, can know both the Individual Soul and Nature, numbering the twenty-fifth and the twenty-fourth respectively.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>दृश्यादृश्ये ह्यनुगतं स्वभावे महाद्युते। अव्यक्तमत्र तद् ब्रह्म बुध्यते तात केवलम्॥<br />O you of great effulgence, only wise men know that Brahma which is Unmanifest, which is in its real nature to all that is seen and unseen, and which, O son, is the one independent essence in the universe,</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>केवलं पञ्चविंशं च चतुर्विंशं न पश्यति। बुध्यमानो यदाऽऽत्मानमन्योऽहमिति मन्यते॥<br />When Individual Soul considers himself different from what he truly is, it is only then that lie fails to know the Supreme Soul and himself and Nature with which he is united.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>तदा प्रकृतिमानेष भवत्यव्यक्तलोचनः। बुध्यते च परां बुद्धिं विशुद्धाममलां यदा॥<br />When Individual Soul succeeds in understanding Nature then he is said to be restored to his true nature and then does he attain to that high understanding which is pure and stainless.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>षड्विंशो राजशार्दूल तथा बुद्धत्वमाव्रजेत्। ततस्त्यजति सोऽव्यक्तं सर्गप्रलयधर्मि वै॥<br />When Individual Soul succeeds, O foremost of kings, in attaining to that excellent understanding, he then attains to that Pure Knowledge which is called the twenty-sixth (or Brahma). He then casts off the Unmanifest or Nature which has the attributes of Creation and Destruction.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>निर्गुणः प्रकृति वेद गुणयुक्तामचेतनाम्। ततः केवलधर्माऽसौ भवत्यव्यक्तदर्शनात्॥<br />When Individual Soul know Nature which is unintelligent and subject to the action of the three qualities of Goodness, Darkness and Ignorance, he then becomes shorn of qualities himself. On account of his thus understanding the Unmanifest, he succeeds in acquiring the nature of the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>केवलेन समागम्य विमुक्तोऽऽत्मानमाप्नुयात्। एतत् तु तत्त्वमित्याहुर्निस्तत्त्वमजरामरम्॥<br />The Learned say that when he is feed from the qualities and united in nature with the Supreme Soul, then does Individual Soul become at one with that Soul. The Supreme Soul, is called the Real as well as Not Real, and is above decay and destruction.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>तत्त्वसंश्रयणादेतत् तत्त्ववन्न च मानद। पञ्चविंशति तत्त्वानि प्रवदन्ति मनीषिणः॥<br />O giver of honours, the Soul, though it has the body for its resting place, yet it cannot be said to have acquired the nature of those principles. The wise say that there are five and twenty principles in all.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>न चैष तत्त्ववांस्तात निस्तत्त्वस्त्वेष बुद्धिमान्। एष मुञ्चति तत्त्वं हि क्षिप्रं बुद्धस्य लक्षणम्॥<br />Indeed, O son, the Soul not to be considered as possessed of any of the principles. Endued with Intelligence, it is above the principles. It renounces quickly even that principle which is the mark of Knowledge.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>षड्विंशोऽहमिति प्राज्ञो गृह्यमाणोऽजरामरः। केवलेन बलेनैव समतां यात्यसंशयम्॥<br />When Individual Soul comes to regard himself as the twenty-sixth which is divested of decay and destruction, it is then that, forsooth, he succeeds by his own force in attaining to similarity with the twenty-sixth.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>षड्विंशेन प्रबुद्धेन बुध्यमानोऽप्यबुद्धिमान्। एतन्नानात्वमित्युक्तं सांख्यश्रुतिनिदर्शनात्॥<br />Though awakened by the twenty-sixth which is Pure Intelligence, Individual Soul still becomes subject to Ignorance. This is the cause of Jiva's multifariousness as explanied in the Shrutis and the Sankhya scriptures.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>चेतनेन समेतस्य पञ्चविंशतिकस्य ह। एकत्वं वै भवत्यस्य यदा बुद्ध्या न बुध्यते॥<br />When Individual Soul, who is endued with consciousness, loses all Consciousness of a distinct or individual self, then does he, losing his multifariousness, resume his Oneness.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>बुध्यमानोऽप्रबुद्धेन समतां याति मैथिल। सङ्गधर्मा भवत्येष निःसङ्गात्मा नराधिप।॥<br />O king, of Mithila, when Individual Soul, who is found to be in union with happiness and misery and who is seldom free from the consciousness of self, becomes identified with the Supreme Soul which transcends understanding, then does he becomes freed from virtue and vice.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>निःसङ्गात्मानमासाद्य षड्विंशकमजं विभुम्। विभुस्त्यजति चाव्यक्तं यदा त्वेतद् विबुद्ध्यते॥<br />Indeed, when Individual soul attaining to the twenty-sixth which is Unborn and Powerful and which is shorn of all attachments, succeeds in comprehend it thoroughly, he himself becomes possessed of power and entirely renounces the Unmanifest or Nature.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>चतुर्विंशमसारं च षड्विंशस्य प्रबोधनात्। एष ह्यप्रतिबुद्धश्च बुध्यमानश्च तेऽनघ॥ प्रोक्तो बुद्धश्च तत्त्वेन यथाश्रुतिनिदर्शनात्। नानात्वैकत्वमेतावद् द्रष्टव्यं शास्त्रदर्शनात्॥<br />For understanding the twenty-sixth, the twenty-four principles seem to Individual soul to be unreal. I have thus told you, O sinless one, according to the indications of the Shrutis the nature of the Unintelligent, and of Individual Soul, as also of that which is Pure knowledge, agreeably to the truth. Guided by the scriptures, variety and oneness are thus to be understood.</p>

Though insooth different from the body in which he lives for the time being, he partakes of the nature of that body on account of his union with it.</p>
