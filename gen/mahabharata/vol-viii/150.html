<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 323</h3><h4>The history of Suka</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच कथं व्यासस्य धर्मात्मा शुको जज्ञे महातपाः। सिद्धिं च परमां प्राप्तस्तन्मे ब्रूहि पितामह॥<br />Yudhishthira said Tell me, O grandfather, how the great Shuka of austere penances took birth as the son of Vyasa, and how did he succeed in acquiring the highest success?</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>कस्यां चोत्पादयामास शुकं व्यासस्तपोधनः। न ह्यस्य जननी विद्मं जन्म चायं महात्मनः॥<br />Upon what woman did Vyasa, having asceticism for his wealth, beget that son of his? We do not know who was Shuka's mother, nor do we know anything of the birth of that great ascetic.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>कथं च बालस्य सत: सूक्ष्मजाने गता मतिः। यथा नान्यस्य लोकेऽस्मिन् द्वितीयस्येह कस्यचित्॥<br />How was it that, when he was a mere boy, his mind became bent to the knowledge of the subtile? Indeed, in this world no second person can be seen in whom such marks could be seen at so early an age.</p>

<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>भीष्म उवाच न हायनैर्न पलितैर्न वित्तैर्न न बन्धुभिः। ऋषयश्चक्रिरे धर्म योऽनूचानः स नो महान्॥<br />The Rishis did not make merit depend upon years of decrepitude or riches or friends. They said that he amongst them was great who studied the Vedas.</p>

<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>इन्द्रियाणां प्रसङ्गेन दोषमृच्छत्यसंशयम्। संनियम्य तु तान्येव सिद्धिमाप्नोति मानवः॥<br />Forsooth, one incurs fault by letting loose his senses. It is only by controlling them that one succeeds in acquiring success.</p>
