<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 343</h3><h4>Why did Narada succeed in seeing Narayana? Why did he go to see Nara and Narayana</h4><p id='1'>शौनक उवाच सौते सुमहदाख्यानं भवता परिकीर्तितम्। यच्छ्रुत्वा मुनयः सर्वे विस्मयं परमं गताः॥<br />Saunaka said O Sauti, excellent is this discourse which you have recounted. Varily, these ascetics, having heard it, have all been filled with surprise.</p>
<p id='2'>सर्वाश्रमाभिगमनं सर्वतीर्थावगाहनम्। न तथा फलदं सौते नारायणकथा यथा।॥<br />It is said, O Sauti, that a discourse that has Narayana for its subject is more fruitful of merit than sojourns to all the sacred retreats and ablutions performed in all the sacred waters on the Earth.</p>
<p id='3'>पाविताङ्गाः स्म संवृत्ताः श्रुत्वेमामादितः कथाम्। नारायणाश्रयां पुण्यां सर्वपापप्रमोचनीम्॥<br />Having listened to this discourse of yours that has Narayana for its theme, that is sacred and capable of purifying one of every sin, all of us have certainly become holy.</p>
<p id='4'>दुर्दर्शो भगवान् देवः सर्वलोकनमस्कृतः। सब्रह्मकैः सुरैः कृत्स्नैरन्यैश्चैव महर्षिभिः॥<br />Worshipped of all the worlds, that illustrious and foremost of gods is incapable of being seen by the gods with Brahman numbering among them and all the Rishis.</p>
<p id='5'>दृष्टवान् नारदो यत्तु देवं नारायणं हरिम्। नूनमेतद्ध्यनुमतं तस्य देवस्य सूतज॥<br />That Narada was able to see of Narayana, otherwise called Hari, was owing, O son of Suta, to the especial favour of that divine and powerful Lord.</p>
<p id='6'>यद् दृष्टवान् जगन्नाथमनिरुद्धतनौ स्थितम्। यत् प्राद्रवत् पुनर्भूयो नारदो देवसत्तमौ॥ नरनारायणौ द्रष्टुं कारणं तद् ब्रवीहि मे।<br />When, however, the celestial Rishi Narada had succeeded in seeing the Supreme Lord of the universe as residing in the form of Aniruddha, why did he again proceed so speedily (to the retreat of Vadari) for seeing those two foremost of gods, viz., Nara and Narayana? Do you, O Sauti, tell us the reason of Narada's conduct.</p>
<p id='7'>सौतिरुवाच तस्मिन् यज्ञे वर्तमाने राज्ञः पारिक्षितस्य वै॥ कर्मान्तरेषु विधिवद् वर्तमानेषु शौनक। कृष्णद्वैपायनं व्यासमृर्षि वेदनिधिं प्रभुम्॥ परिपप्रच्छ राजेन्द्रः पितामहपितामहम्।<br />Sauti said During the continuance of his Sacrifice, Janamejaya, the royal son of Parikshit, taking advantage of an interval in the sacrificial rites, and when all the learned Brahmanas were resting, O Shaunaka, that king of kings, addressed the grand-father of his grand-father, viz., the Island-born Rishi Krishna, otherwise called Vyasa, that ocean of Vedic learning, that foremost of ascetics gifted with power, and said these words.</p>
<p id='8'>जनमेजय उवाच श्वेतद्वीपान्निवृत्तेन नारदेन सुरर्षिणा॥ ध्यायता भगवद्वाक्यं चेष्टितं किमतः परम्।<br />Janamejaya said After the celestial Rishi Narada had come beck from White-Island, reflecting, as he came, on the words spoken to him by the holy Narayana, what, indeed, did that great ascetic next do?</p>
<p id='9'>बदर्याश्रममागम्य समागम्य च तावृषी॥ कियन्तं कालमवसत् कां कथां पृष्टवांश्च सः।<br />Arrived at the retreat known by the name of Vadari on the breast of the Himavat mountains, and seeing the two Rishis Nara and Narayana who were practising severe austerities at that place, how long did Narada live there and what were the subjects of conversation between him and the two Rishis?</p>
<p id='10'>इदं शतसहस्राद्धि भारताख्यानविस्तरात्॥ आमन्थ्य मतिमन्थेन ज्ञानोदधिमनुत्तमम्।<br />This discourse on Narayana, that is really an ocean of knowledge, has been raised by your intelligent self by churning that vast history called Bharata which consists of a hundred thousand Verses,</p>
<p id='11'>नवनीतं यथा दध्मो मलयाच्चन्दनं यथा॥ आरण्यकं च वेदेभ्य ओषधिभ्योऽमृतं यथा। समुद्धृतमिदं ब्रह्मन् कथामृतमिदं तथा॥ तपोनिधे त्वयोक्तं हि नारायणकथाश्रयम्।<br />As butter is raised from curds, sandal-wood from the mountains of Malaya, the Aranyakas from the Vedas, and ambrosia from all the medicinal herbs, similarly, O ocean of austerities, has this discourse that is like ambrosia and that has Narayana for its object, been raised by you, O Brahmana, from various histories and Puranas existing in the world.</p>
<p id='12'>स ईशो भगवान् देवः सर्वभूतात्मभावनः॥ अहो नारायणं तेजो दुर्दर्श द्विजसत्तम।<br />Narayana is the Supreme Lord. Illustrious and gifted with great power. He is the soul of all creatures. Indeed, O foremost of twice-born ones, the energy of Narayana is irresistible.</p>
<p id='13'>यत्राविशन्ति कल्पान्ते सर्वे ब्रह्मादय: सुराः॥ ऋषयश्च सगन्धर्वा यच्च किंचिच्चराचरम्।<br />At the end of the aeon, all the gods having Brahman for their foremost, all Rishis with the Gandharvas, and all things mobile and immobile, enter into Narayana.</p>
<p id='14'>न ततोऽस्ति परं मन्ये पावनं दिवि चेह च॥ सर्वाश्रमाभिगमनं सर्वतीर्थावगाहनम्। न तथा फलदं चापि नारायणकथा यथा॥ सर्वथा पाविताः स्मेह श्रुत्वेमामादितः कथाम्। हरेविश्वेश्वरस्येह सर्वपापप्रणाशनीम्॥ न चित्रं कृतवांस्तत्र यदार्यो मे धनंजयः। वासुदेवसहायो यः प्राप्तवाञ्जयमुत्तमम्॥ न चास्य किंचिदप्राप्यं मन्ये लोकेष्वपि त्रिषु। त्रैलोक्यनाथो विष्णुः स यथाऽऽसीत् साह्यकृत् स वै। धन्याश्च सर्व एवासन् ब्रह्मस्ते मम पूर्वजाः। हिताय श्रेयसे चैव येषामसीज्जनार्दनः॥ तपसाथ सुदृश्यो हि भगवाल्लोकपूजितः।<br />I think, therefore, that there is nothing holier on earth or in heaven and nothing higher than Narayana. A sojourn to all the sacred places on Earth, and ablutions performed in all were the sacred waters, do not produce so much merit as a discourse that has Narayana for its subject. Having listened to this discourse from the beginning,-this discourse on Hari, the lord of the universe, which dissipates all sins, we feel that we have been purged off of all our sins, and sanctified entirely. Nothing wonderful was done by my ancestor Dhananjaya whose was the victory in the great battle on Kurukshetra, for it should be remembered that he had Vasudeva for his friend. I think that that person could have nothing unattainable in the three-worlds, who had for his friend Vishnu himself, that great Lord of the universe! Highly fortunate and and commendable those ancestors of mine, since they had Janarddana himself for superintending their temporal and spiritual prosperity. Worshipped of all the worlds, the holy Narayana is capable of being seen with the help of austerities alone.</p>
<p id='15'>यं दृष्टवन्तस्ते साक्षाच्छ्वत्साकविभूषणम्॥ तेभ्यो धन्यतरचैव नारदः परमेष्ठिजः।<br />They, however, succeeded in seeing Narayana adorned with the beautiful mystic mark. More fortunate than my ancestors was the celestial Rishi Narada the the son of Prameshthi.</p>
<p id='16'>न चाल्पतेजसमृर्षि वेद्म नारदमव्ययम्॥ श्वेतद्वीपं समासाद्य येन दृष्टः स्वयं हरिः।<br />Indeed, I think that Narada, who is above all destruction, was gifted with great energy, for going to White-Island he had succeeded in seeing the person of Hari.</p>
<p id='17'>देवप्रसादानुगतं व्यक्तं तत् तस्य दर्शनम्॥ तद् दृष्टवांस्तदा देवमनिरुद्धतनौ स्थितम्।<br />Indeed, it is clear that the sight he had got of the Supreme Lord was owing to only the favour of that Being. Fortunate was Narada inasmuch as he had succeeded in seeing Narayana as existing in the form of Aniruddha. agiru TTG: TECL 7:118411</p>
<p id='18'>नरनारायणौ द्रष्टुं किं तु तत् कारणं मुने।<br />Having seen Narayana in that form, why did Narada hasten once more to the hermitage of Vadari for seeing Nara and Narayana! What was the reason, O ascetic of this step taken by Narada?</p>
<p id='19'>श्वेतद्वीपानिवृत्तश्च नारदः परमेष्ठिजः॥ बदरीमाश्रमं प्राप्य समागम्य च तावृषी। कियन्तं कालमवसत् प्रश्नान् कान् पृष्टवांश्च ह॥ श्वेतद्वीपादुपावृत्ते तस्मिन् वा सुमहात्मनि। किमब्रूतां महात्मानौ नरनारायणावृषी॥ तदेतन्मे यथातत्त्वं सर्वमाख्यातुमर्हसि।<br />How long also did Narada the son of Prameshthi, after his return from White Island and arrival at Vadari and meeting with the two Rishis Nara and Narayana, reside there, and what conversation had he with them? What did those two great and foremost of Rishis say to him? You should tell me all this.</p>
<p id='20'>वैशम्पायन उवाच नमो भवगते तस्मै व्यासायामिततेजसे॥ यस्य प्रसादाद् वक्ष्यामि नारायणकथामिमाम्।<br />Vaishampayana said Salutations to the holy Vyasa of incomparable energy. Through his favour; I shall recite this narrative having Narayana for its theme.</p>
<p id='21'>प्राप्य श्वेतं महाद्वीपं दृष्ट्वा च हरिमव्ययम्॥ निवृत्तो नारदो राजंस्तरसा मेरुमागमत्। हृदयेनोद्वहन् भारं यदुक्तं परमात्मना॥<br />Arrived at White Island Narada saw the immutable Hari. Leaving that place, he speedily went, O king, to the mountains of Meru, remembering those weighty words which the Supreme Lord had said to him. Arrived at Meru he became filled with wonder at the thought, O king, of what he had done.</p>
<p id='22'>पश्चादस्याभवद् राजन्नात्मनः साध्वसं महत्। यद् गत्वा दूरमध्वानं क्षेमी पुनरिहागतः॥ मेरोः प्रचक्राम ततः पर्वतं गन्धमादनम्।<br />And he said to himself,-'How wonderful is it! The journey I have done is a long one! Having gone to such a distance, I have returned safe and sound!' From the mountains of Meru he then went towards Gandhamadana.</p>
<p id='23'>निपपात च खात् तूर्णं विशाला बदरीमनु॥ ततः स ददृशे देवौ पुराणावृषिसत्तमौ। तपश्चरन्तौ सुमहदात्मनिष्ठौ महाव्रतौ॥<br />Passing through the skies he speedily got down upon that extensive retreat known by the name of Vadari. There he saw those ancient gods, viz., those two foremost of Rishis, (called Nara and Narayana) performing penances, observing high vows, and depending upon their own selves.</p>
<p id='24'>तेजसाभ्यधिको सूर्यात् सर्वलोकविरोचनात्। श्रीवत्सलक्षणौ पूज्यौ जटामण्डलधारिणौ॥<br />Both of those adorable persons bore on their chests the mystic marks called Shrivatsa, and both had matted locks on their heads. And an account of the effulgence with which they illumined the world they seemed to surpass the very Sun in energy.</p>
<p id='25'>जालपादभुजौ तौ तु पादयोश्चक्रलक्षणौ। व्यूढोरस्कौ दीर्घभुजौ तथा मुष्कचतुष्किणौ॥<br />The palms of each bore the mark called the swan's foot. The soles of their feet bore the mark of the discus. Their chests were very broad; their arms extended to their knees. Each of them had four shoulder joints.</p>
<p id='26'>षष्टिदन्तावष्टदंष्ट्रौ मेघौघसदृशस्वनौ। स्वास्यौ पृथुललाटौ च सुभ्र सुहनुनासिकौ॥<br />Each of them had sixty teeth and four arms. The voice of each was as deep as the roaring of the clouds. Their faces were highly beautiful, their foreheads broad, their brows fair, their cheeks well-formed, and their noses acquiline.</p>
<p id='27'>आतपत्रेण सदृशे शिरसी देवयोस्तयोः। एवं लक्षणसम्पन्नौ महापुरुषसंज्ञितौ॥<br />The heads of those two gods were large and round, resembling open umbrellas. Endued with these marks, they were certainly very superior persons in appearance.</p>
<p id='28'>तौ दृष्ट्वा नारदो हृष्टस्ताभ्यां च प्रतिपूजितः। स्वागतेनाभिभाष्याथ पृष्टश्चानामयं तथा॥ बभूवान्तर्गतमतिर्निरीक्ष्य पुरुषोत्तमौ। सदोगतास्तत्र ये वै सर्वभूतनमस्कृताः॥ श्वेतद्वीपे मया दृष्टास्तादृशावृषिसत्तमौ।<br />Seeing them Narada became filled with joy. He saluted them with respect and was saluted by them in return. They received the celestial Rishi, saying Welcome,' and made the ordinary enquiries. Seeing those two foremost of Beings, Narada began to think within himself, — These two foremost of Rishis that are respected by all creatures seem to be very like, in appearance, to those persons, worshipped of all beings, whom I have seen in White-Island.</p>
<p id='29'>इति संचिन्त्य मनसा कृत्वा चाभिप्रदक्षिणम्॥ स चोपविविशे तत्र पीठे कुशमये शुभे।<br />Thinking thus, he went round them both and then sat down on the excellent seat made of Kusha grass that had been offered to him.</p>
<p id='30'>ततस्तौ तपसां वासौ यशसां तेजसामपि॥ ऋषी शमदमोपेतौ कृत्वा पौर्वाह्निकं विधिम्।<br />After this, those two Rishis that were the abode of penances, of famous deeds, and of energy,-those ascetics that were gifted with tranquillity of heart and self-control, performed their morning rites.</p>
<p id='31'>पश्चान्नारदमव्यग्रौ पाद्यार्थ्याभ्यामथार्चतः॥ पीठयोचोपविष्टौ तौ कृतातिथ्याह्निको नृप।<br />They then, without anxious hearts, adored Narada with water to wash his feet and the usual articles of the Arghya. Having performed their morning rites and the observances necessary for receiving their guest, they sat down on the two seats made of wood.</p>
<p id='32'>तेषु तत्रोपविष्टेषु स देशोऽभिव्यराजत॥ आज्याहुतिमहाज्वालैर्यज्ञवाटो यथाग्निभिः।<br />When those two Rishis sat, that place began to shine with peculiar beauty even as the sacrificial altar shines with beauty on account of the sacred fires when libations of clarified butter are poured upon them.</p>
<p id='33'>अथ नारायणस्तत्र नारदं वाक्यमब्रवीत्॥ सुखोपविष्टं विश्रान्तं कृतातिथ्यं सुखस्थितम्।<br />Then seeing Narada refreshed from fatigue and seated at his ease and well-pleased with the rites of hospitality he had received, Narayana said these words.</p>
<p id='34'>नरनारायणावूचतुः। अपीदानी स भगवान् परमात्मा सनातनः॥ श्वेतद्वीपे त्वया दृष्ट आवयोः प्रकृतिः परा।<br />Have you seen in White Island the Supreme Soul, who is eternal and divine, and who is the high source whence we have originated.</p>
<p id='35'>नारद उवाच दृष्टो मे पुरुषः श्रीमान् विश्वरूपधरोऽव्ययः॥ सर्वे लोका हि तत्रस्थास्तथा देवाः सहर्षिभिः।<br />Narada said are I have seen that beautiful Being who is immutable and who has universe for his form! In Hiin live all the worlds, and all the gods with the Rishis.</p>
<p id='36'>अद्यापि चैनं पश्यामि युवां पश्यन् सनातनौ।॥ यैर्लक्षणैरुपेतः स हरिरव्यक्तरूपधृक्। तैर्लक्षणैरुपेतौ हि व्यक्तरूपधरौ युवाम्॥ दृष्टौ युवां मया तत्र तस्य देवस्य पार्श्वतः।<br />Even now I see that Being in seeing you two who eternal. Those marks and indications that characterise Hari himself of unmanifest form, characterise you two who are endued with manifest forms. Verily, I see both of you by the side of that great God.</p>
<p id='37'>इहैव चागतोऽस्म्पद्य विसृष्टः परमात्मना॥ को हि नाम भवेत् तस्य तेजसा यशसा श्रिया। सदृशस्त्रिषु लोकेषु ऋते धर्मात्मजौ युवाम्॥<br />Dismissed by the Supreme Soul, I have come here to-day. In energy, fame and beauty, who else in the three worlds can equal Him than you two who have been born in the race of Dharma.</p>
<p id='38'>तेन मे कथितः कृत्स्नो धर्मः क्षेत्रज्ञसंज्ञितः। प्रादुर्भावाश्च कथिता भविष्या इह ये यथा।॥<br />He has told me the entire list of duties referring to Soul. He has also told me of all those incarnations which he will, in the future, have in this world.</p>
<p id='39'>तत्र ये पुरुषाः श्वेताः पञ्चेन्द्रियविवर्जिताः। प्रतिबुद्धाश्च ते सर्वे भक्ताश्च पुरुषोत्तमम्॥ तेऽर्चयन्ति सदा देवं तैः सार्धं रमते च सः।<br />The inhabitants, of White Island whom I have seen, are all shorn of the five senses that the ordinary persons have. All of them are of awakened souls, endued as they are with true knowledge. They are, again, entirely devoted to the foremost of Beings, viz., the Supreme Lord of the universe. They always engaged in adoring that great God, and the latter always sports with them.</p>
<p id='40'>प्रियभक्तो हि भगवान् परमात्मा द्विजप्रियः॥ रमते सोऽय॑मानो हि सदा भागवतप्रियः।<br />The holy and Supreme Soul is always fond of those who are devoted to him. He is fond also of the twice-born ones. Always fond of those who are devoted to Him. He sports with those worshippers of His.</p>
<p id='41'>विश्वभुक् सर्वगो देवो माधवो भक्तवत्सलः॥ स कर्ता कारणं चैव कार्यं चातिबलद्युतिः।<br />Enjoying the universe, pervading everything, the illustrious Madhava is ever affectionate towards his worshippers. He is the Actor; he is the Cause; and He is the Effect. He is gifted with omnipotence and immeasurable, effulgence.</p>
<p id='42'>हेतुश्चाज्ञा विधानं च तत्त्वं चैव महायशाः॥ तपसा योज्य सोऽऽत्मानं श्वेतद्वीपात् परं हि यत्। तेज इत्यभिविख्यातं स्वयंभासावभासितम्॥ शान्तिः सा त्रिषु लोकेषु विहिता भावितात्मना।<br />He is the Cause whence all things proceed. He is the embodiment of all the scriptural injunction. He is the embodiment of all themes. He is endued with great fame. Uniting Himself with penances, He has lighted Himself with a splendour which is said to represent an energy that is higher than (what is in) White Island. Of soul purified by penances, He has ordained Peace and Tranquillity in the three worlds.</p>
<p id='43'>एतया शुभया बुद्ध्या नैष्ठिकं व्रतमास्थितः॥ न तत्र सूर्यस्तपति न सोमोऽभिविराजते। न वायुर्वाति देवेशे तपश्चरति दुश्चरम्॥<br />With such an auspicious understanding, he observes a very superior vow which is the embodiment of holiness. The Sun warms not and Soma does not adorn the region where he lives practising austerest penances. There the wind blows not.</p>
<p id='44'>वेदीमष्टनलोत्सेधां भूमावास्थाय विश्वकृत्। एकपादस्थितो देव उर्ध्वबाहुरुदङ्मुख॥<br />Having made an altar measuring eight fingers breadth, the illustrious Creator of the universe is practising penances there, standing on one foot, with arms upraised, and with face directed towards the East.</p>
<p id='45'>साङ्गानावर्तयन् वेदांस्तपस्तेपे सुदुश्चरम्। यद् ब्रह्मा ऋषयश्चैव स्वयं पशुपतिश्च यत्॥ शेषाश्च विबुधश्रेष्ठा दैत्यदानवराक्षसाः। नागाः सुपर्णा गन्धर्वाः सिद्धा राजर्षयश्च ये॥ हव्यं कव्यं च सततं विधियुक्तं प्रयुञ्जते। कृत्स्नं तु तस्य देवस्य चरणावुपतिष्ठति॥<br />Reciting the Vedas with their branches, he is practising the severest austerities. Whatever libations of clarified butter or meat are poured on the sacrificial fire according to the ordinances of Brahman, by the Rishis, by Pashupati himself, by the rest of the principal gods, by the Daityas, the Danavas, and the Rakshasas, Nagas, Garuda bird, Gandharvas, Siddhas and foremost of the sages and whatever sacrificial oblation are offered, all reach the feet of that great god.</p>
<p id='46'>याः क्रियाः सम्प्रयुक्ताश्च एकान्तगतबुद्धिभिः। ताः सर्वाः शिरसा देवः प्रतिगृह्णाति वै स्वयम्॥<br />Whatever rites and religious acts are performed by persons whose souls are entirely given to him, are all received by that great God on his head.</p>
<p id='47'>न तस्यान्यः प्रियतरः प्रतिबुद्धैर्महात्मभिः। विद्यते त्रिषु लोकेषु ततोऽस्यैकान्तिकं गतः॥<br />No one is dearer to him in the three worlds than those persons who are enlightened and possessed of great souls. Dearer even than those persons is one who is entirely devoted to him.</p>
<p id='48'>इह चैवागतस्तेन विसृष्टः परमात्मना। एवं मे भगवान् देवः स्वयमाख्यातवान् हरिः। आसिष्ये तत्परो भूत्वा युवाभ्यां सह नित्यशः॥<br />Dismissed by him who is the Supreme Soul, I am coming here. This is what the illustrious and holy Hari has himself said to me. I shall henceforth live with you two, devoted to Narayana in the form of Anirudhha.</p>
