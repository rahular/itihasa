What is your opinion about these virtues?</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>भीष्म उवाच अत्र ते वर्तयिष्येऽहमितिहासं पुरातनम्। साध्यानामिह संवादं हंसस्य च युधिष्ठिर॥<br />Bhishma said Regarding it I shall recite to you an old narrative, O Yudhishthira, of the discourse between the Sadhyas and a Swan.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>हंसो भूत्वाथ सौवर्णस्त्वजो नित्यः प्रजापतिः। स वै पर्येति लोकांस्त्रीनथ साध्यानुपागमत्॥<br />Once on a time the uncreate and eternal Lord of all creatures, assuming the form of a golden Swan, passed through the three worlds till in course of his ramblings he came upon the Sadhyas.</p>

We like to question you. Indeed, we would ask you about the religion of liberation. You are well acquainted with it.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>श्रुतोऽसिः न पण्डितो धीरवादी साधुशब्दश्चरते ते पतत्रिन्। किं मन्यसे श्रेष्ठतमं द्विज त्वं कस्मिन्मनस्ते रमते महात्मन्॥<br />We have heard, O bird, that you are endued with great learning, and eloquent and wise of speech. O bird, what do you think is the highest of all objects? O great one, in what does your mind find pleasure?</p>

Losing all the knots of the heart, one should also bring under his control both what is pleasant and what is unpleasant.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>नारुन्तुदः स्यान्न नृशंसवादी न हीनतः परमभ्याददीत। ययास्य वाचा पर उद्विजेत न तां वदेद्रुषती पापलोक्याम्॥<br />One should not cut the vitals of others.
