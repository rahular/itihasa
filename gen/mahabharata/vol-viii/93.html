<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 266</h3><h4>The determination of an obligatory act</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच कथं कार्यं परीक्षेत शीघ्रं वाथ चिरेण वा। सर्वथा कार्यदुर्गेऽस्मिन् भवान् नः परमो गुरुः॥<br />Yudhishthira said You, O grandfather, are our highest preceptor in the matter of all acts which it is difficult to perform. I ask, how should one judge of an act regarding one's obligation to do it or of abstaining from it? Is it to be judged quickly or with delay?</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>भीष्म उवाच अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। चिरकारेस्तु यत् पूर्वं वृत्तमाङ्गिरसे कुले॥<br />Regarding it is cited the old discourse of what took place regarding Chirakarin born in the race of Angirasa.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>चिरकारिक भद्रं ते भद्रं ते चिरकारिक। चिरकारी हि मेधावी नापराध्यति कर्मसु॥<br />Twice blessed be the man who thinks long before he acts! One man who thinks long before he acts is surely possessed of great intelligence. Such a man never offends in an act.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>चिरकारी महाप्राज्ञो गौतमस्याभवत् सुतः। चिरेण सर्वकार्याणि विमृश्यार्थान् प्रपद्यते॥<br />There was once a highly wise man by name Chirakarin, who was the son of Gautama. Thinking for a long time upon every aspect of proposed acts, he used to do all he had to do.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>चिरं स चिन्तयत्यर्थांश्चिरं जाग्रच्चिरं स्वपन्। चिरं कार्याभिपत्तिं च चिरकारी तथोच्यते॥<br />He passed by the name of Chirakarin because he used to think long upon all matters, to remain awake for a long time, to sleep for a long time, and to take a long time in performing such acts.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>अलसग्रहणं प्राप्तो दुर्मेधावी तथोच्यते। बुद्धिलाघवयुक्तेन जनेनादीर्घदर्शिना॥<br />But still he passed for an idle man. He was also considered as a foolish person, by every person of a light understanding and shorn of foresight.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>व्यभिचारे तु कस्मिश्चिद् व्यतिक्रम्यापरान् सुतान्। पित्रोक्तः कुपितेनाथ जहीमां जननीमिति॥<br />On a certain occasion, seeing an act of great fault in his wife, the father Gautama, passing over his other children commanded in anger this Chirakarin, saying,-kill this women!</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>इत्युक्त्वा स तदा विप्रो गौतमो जपतां वरः। अविमृश्य महाभागो वनमेव जगाम सः॥<br />Having said these words without much thought, the learned Gautama, that foremost of persons engaged in the practice of Yoga, that highly blessed ascetic, left for the forest.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>स तथेति चिरेणोक्त्वा स्वभावाच्चिरकारिकः। विमृश्य चिरकारित्वाच्चिन्तयामास वैचिरम्॥<br />Having after a long while assented to it, saying,-So be it,-Chirakarin, on account of his very nature, and owing to his habit of never performing any act without much thought, began to think for a long while.-पितुराज्ञां कथं कुर्यां न हन्यां मातरं कथम्।</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>कथं धर्मच्छलेनास्मिन् निमज्जेयमसाधुवत्।१०॥<br />How shall I obey the order of my father, and yet how avoid killing my mother? How shall I avoid sinking, like a wicked man, into sin in this plight in which contradictory duties are dragging me into opposite directions?</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>पितुराज्ञा परो धर्मः स्वधर्मो मातृरक्षणम्। अस्वतन्त्रं च पुत्रत्वं किं तु मां नानुपीडयेत॥<br />Obedience to the orders of the father forms the highest merit. The protection of the mother again is a clear duty. The condition of a son is fraught with dependence. How shall I avoid being affected by sin?</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>स्त्रियं हत्वा मातरं च को हि जातु सुखी भवेत्। पितरं चाप्यवज्ञाय कः प्रतिष्ठामवाप्नुयात्॥<br />Who is there that can be happy after having killed a woman, especially his mother? Who again can acquire prosperity and fame by disobeying his own father.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>अनवज्ञा पितुर्युक्ता धारणं मातृरक्षणम्। युक्तक्षमावुभावेतौ नातिवर्तेत मां कथम्॥<br />Regard for the father's order is obligatory. The protection of my mother is equally a duty. How shall I so act that both obligations may be satisfied?</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>पिता ह्यात्मानमाधत्ते जायायां जज्ञिवानिति। शीलचारित्रगोत्रस्य धारणार्थं कुलस्य च॥<br />The father puts his own self within the mother's womb and takes birth as the son, for continuing his practices, conduct, name and race.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>सोऽहं मात्रा स्वयं पित्रा पुत्रत्वे प्रकृतः पुनः विज्ञानं मे कथं न स्याद् द्वौ बुद्ध्ये चात्मसम्भवम्॥<br />I have been begotten as a son by both my mother and my father. Knowing as I do my own birth, why should I not have this knowledge?</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>जातकर्मणि यत् प्राह पिता यच्चोपकर्मणि। पर्याप्तः स दृढीकारः पितुर्गौरवनिश्चये।१६।।<br />The words spoken by the father while performing the initial rite consequent upon birth, and those that were spoken by him on the occasion of the subsidiary rite are sufficient (evidence) for settling the respect due to him and, indeed, confirm the respect actually paid to him.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>गुरुरम्यः परो धर्मः पोषणाध्यापनान्वितः। पिता यदाह धर्मः स वेदेष्वपि सुनिश्चितः॥<br />On account of his bringing up the son and instructing him, the father is the son's foremost of superiors and the highest religion. The very Vedas sanction it as certain that the son should consider what the father says as his highest duty.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>प्रीतिमात्रं पितुः पुत्रः सर्वं पुत्रस्य वै पिता। शरीरादीनि देयानि पिता त्वेकः प्रयच्छति॥<br />The son is only a source of joy to his father. The father is all in all to a son. The body and all else that the son has he has got from the father alone.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>तस्मात् पितुर्वचः कार्यं न विचार्यं कदाचन। पातकान्यपि पूयन्ते पितुः शासनकारिणः॥<br />Hence, the commands of the father should be obeyed without ever questioning them in the least. The very sins of one who obeys his father are cleansed.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>भोग्ये भोज्ये प्रवचने सर्वलोकनिदर्शने। भर्चा चैव समायोगे सीमन्तोन्नयने तथा॥<br />The father is the giver of all articles of enjoyment, of all articles of food, of instructions in the Vedas, and of all other knowledge of the world. The father is the performer of such rites as Garbhadhana (the ceremony for the attainment of puberty by the wife), and Simantonnayana the ceremony performed by the husband in the fourth, sixth, or eighth, month of gestation.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>पिता धर्म: पिता स्वर्गः पिता हि परमं तपः। पितरि प्रीतिमापन्ने सर्वाः प्रीयन्ति देवताः॥<br />The father is religion. The father is heaven. The father is the highest penance. The father being pleased all the gods are pleased.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>आशिषस्ता भजन्त्येनं परुषं प्राह यत् पिता। निष्कृतिः सर्वपापानां पिता यच्चाभिनन्दति॥<br />Whatever words are spoken by the father, become blessings that attach to the son. The words of joy that the father utters purify the son of all his sins.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>मुच्यते बन्धनात् पुष्पं फलं वृक्षात् प्रमुच्यते। क्लिश्यन्नपि सुतं स्नेहैः पिता पुत्रं न मुञ्चति॥<br />The flower is seen to drop down from the stalk. The fruit is seen to drop down from the tree. But the father, in whatever difficulty he may be, moved by parental affection, never leaves the son.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>एतद् विचिन्तितं तावत् पुत्रस्य पितृगौरवम्। पिता नाल्पतरं स्थानं चिन्तयिष्यामि मातरम्॥<br />These then are my thoughts upon the respect due from the son to the father. The father is not an ordinary object to the son, I shall now think upon the mother.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>यो ह्ययं मयि संघातो मयत्वे पाञ्चभौतिकः। यस्य मे जननी हेतुः पावकस्य यथारणिः॥<br />Of this the mother is the principal cause of those union of the five elements in me due to my birth as a human being, as the fire-sticks of fire.</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>माता देहारणिः पुंसां सर्वस्यार्तस्य निर्वृतिः। मातृलोभे सनाथत्वमनाथत्वं विपर्यये॥<br />The mother is as the fire-stick about the bodies of all men. She is the medicine for all sorts of calamities. The existence of the mother grants protection to one; the reverse deprives one of all protection.</p>
<p id='27'><a href='#27'></a>न च शोचति नाप्येनं स्थाविर्यमपकर्षति। श्रिया हीनोऽपि यो गेहमम्बेति प्रतिपद्यते॥<br />The man who, thought shorn of prosperity, enters his house uttering the words-0 mother!-does not suffer from grief. Nor does decrepitude ever attack him.</p>
<p id='28'><a href='#28'></a>पुत्रपौत्रोपपन्नोऽपि जननीं यः समाश्रितः। अपि वर्षशतस्यान्ते स द्विहायनवच्चरेत्॥<br />A person whose mother exists, even if he has sons and grandsons and even if he is a hundred years old, looks like a child of two.</p>
<p id='29'><a href='#29'></a>समर्थं वासमर्थं वा कृशं वाप्यकृशं तथा। रक्षत्येव सुतं माता नान्यः पोष्टा विधानतः॥<br />Able or disabled, lean or robust, the son is always protected by the mother. None else, according to the Scripture, is the son's protector.</p>
<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>तदा स वृद्धो भवति तदा भवति दुःखितः। तदा शून्यं जगत् तस्य यदा मात्रा वियुज्यते॥<br />When the mother leaves him then does the son become old, then does he become stricken with grief, then does the world look empty in his eyes.</p>
<p id='31'><a href='#31'></a>नास्ति मातृसमा छाया नास्ति मातृसमा गतिः। नास्ति मातृसमं त्राणं नास्ति मातृसमा प्रिया॥<br />There is no shelter like the mother. There is no refuge like the mother. There is no defence like the mother. There is no one dearer than the mother.</p>
<p id='32'><a href='#32'></a>कुक्षिसंधारणाद् धात्री जननाज्जननी स्मृता। अङ्गानां वर्धनादम्बा वीरसूत्वेन वीरसूः॥<br />For having borne him in her womb the mother is the son's Dhatri. For having been the principal cause of his birth, she is his Janani. For having reared his young limbs, she is called Amva. For giving birth to a child possessed of courage, she is called Virasu.</p>
<p id='33'><a href='#33'></a>शिशोः शुश्रूषणाच्छुश्रूर्माता देहमनन्तरम्। चेतनावान् नरो हन्याद् यस्य नासुषिरं शिरः॥<br />For nursing and loO king after the son, she is called Shushru. The mother is one's own body. What rational man is there who would kill his mother to whose care only his own head did not lie on the street like a dry gourd?</p>
<p id='34'><a href='#34'></a>दम्पत्योः प्राणसंश्लेषे योऽभिसंधिः कृतः किल। तं माता च पिता चेति भूतार्थो मातरि स्थितः॥<br />When husband and wife unite themselves for procreation, the desire for a son is cherished by both, but about its fruition more depends upon the mother than on the father.</p>
<p id='35'><a href='#35'></a>माता जानाति यद्गोत्रं माता जानाति यस्य सः। मातुर्भरणमात्रेण प्रीतिः स्नेहः पितुः प्रजाः॥<br />The mother knows the family in which the son is born and the father who has begotten him. From the time of conception the mother beings to show affection to her child and find joy in him. On the other hand, the Scriptures hold that the issue belong to the father only.</p>
<p id='36'><a href='#36'></a>पाणिबन्धं स्वयं कृत्वा सह धर्ममुपेत्य च। यदा यास्यन्ति पुरुषाः स्त्रियो नार्हन्ति वाच्यताम्॥<br />If men, after taking wives and pledging themselves to acquire religious merit without being dissociated from them, seek union with other people's wives, they then cease to deserve respect.</p>
<p id='37'><a href='#37'></a>भरणाद्धि स्त्रियो भर्ता पालनाद्धि पतिस्तथा। गुणस्यास्य निवृत्तौ तु न भर्ता न पुनः पतिः॥<br />The husband, because he maintains the wife, is called Bharta, and he is called Pati, because he protects her. When he fails to discharge these two functions, he ceases to both Bhartri and Pati.</p>
<p id='38'><a href='#38'></a>एवं स्त्री नापरानोति नर एवापराध्यति। व्युच्चरंश्च महादोषं नर एवापराध्यति॥<br />Then again woman can commit no fault. It is man only who commits commits faults. By committing an act of adultery, the man only becomes sullied with sin.</p>
<p id='39'><a href='#39'></a>स्त्रिया हि परमो भर्ता दैवतं परमं स्मृतम्। तस्यात्मना तु सदृशमात्मानं परमं ददौ॥<br />It has been said that the husband is the highest object with the wife and the highest god to her. My mother resigned her sacred person to one who came to her in the shape of hcr own husband.</p>
<p id='40'><a href='#40'></a>नापराधोऽस्ति नारीणां नर एवापराध्यति। सर्वकार्यापराध्यत्वान्नापराध्यन्ति चाङ्गनाः॥<br />Women can commit no sin. It is man who becomes sullied with sin. Indeed, on account of the natural weakness of the sex as shown in every act, and their liability to solicitation, women cannot be considered as offenders.</p>
<p id='41'><a href='#41'></a>यश्च नोक्तोऽथ निर्देशः स्त्रिया मैथुनतृप्तये। तस्य स्मारयतो व्यक्तमधर्मो नास्ति संशयः॥<br />Then again the sinfulness is evident of Indra himself who made the recollection of the request that had been made to him in days of yore by woman. There is no doubt that my mother is sinless.</p>
<p id='42'><a href='#42'></a>एवं नारी मातरं च गौरवे चाधिके स्थिताम्। अवध्यां तु विजानीयुः पशवोऽप्यविचक्षणाः॥<br />She whom I have been ordered to kill is a woman. That woman is again my own mother. She occupies, therefore, a place of greater respect. The very beasts which are irrational, know that the mother should not be killed.</p>
<p id='43'><a href='#43'></a>देवतानां समावायमेकस्थं पितरं विदुः। मानां देवातनां च स्नेहादभ्येति मातरम्॥<br />The father must be known to be a combination of all the gods together. The mother, however, is a combination of all mortal creatures and all the gods.</p>
<p id='44'><a href='#44'></a>एवं विमृशतस्तस्य चिरकारितया बहु। दीर्घ कालो व्यतिक्रान्तस्ततोऽस्याभ्यागमत् पिता॥<br />On account of his habit of reflecting long before acting, Gautama's son Chirakarin, by thinking thus, passed a long time. After many days, his father Gautama came back.</p>
<p id='45'><a href='#45'></a>मेधातिथिर्महाप्राज्ञो गौतमस्तपसि स्थितः। विमृश्य तेन कालेन पन्याः संस्थाव्यतिक्रमम्॥<br />Gifted with great wisdom, Medhatithi of Gautama's race. Practising penances, returned, convinced, after having meditated for that long time, of the impropriety of the punishment he had ordered to be inflicted upon his wife.</p>
<p id='46'><a href='#46'></a>सोऽब्रवीद् भृशंसंतप्तो दुःखेनाश्रूणि वर्तयन्। श्रुतधैर्यप्रसादेन पश्चात्तापमुपागतः॥<br />Burning with grief and shedding profuse tears, for repentance had come to hiin on account of the wholesome effects of that calmness of temper which is caused by a knowledge of the scriptures, he said:-</p>
<p id='47'><a href='#47'></a>आश्रमं मम सम्प्राप्तस्त्रिलोकेशः पुरंदरः। अतिथिव्रतमास्थाय ब्राह्मणं रूपमास्थितः॥<br />The lord of the three worlds, viz., Purandara, came to my asylum, in the guise of a Brahmana asking for hospitality.</p>
<p id='48'><a href='#48'></a>स मया सान्त्वितो वाग्भिः स्वागतेनाभिपूजितः। अर्घ्यं पाद्यं यथान्यायं मया च प्रतिपादितः॥<br />He was received by me with becoming words, and welcomed and presented in due form with water to wash his feet and the usual offerings of the Arghya. I also gave him the rest he had asked for.</p>
<p id='49'><a href='#49'></a>परवानस्मि चेत्युक्तः प्रणयिष्यति तेन च। अत्र चाकुशले जाते स्त्रिया नास्ति व्यतिक्रमः॥<br />I further told him that I had acquired a protector in him, I thought that such conduct on my part would make him treat me as a friend. When, however, not-withstanding all this, he misbehaved himself, my wife Ahalya could not be considered to have committed any sin.</p>
<p id='50'><a href='#50'></a>एवं न स्त्री न चैवाहं नाध्वगस्त्रिदशेश्वरः। अपराध्यति धर्मस्य प्रमादस्त्वपराध्यति॥<br />It seems that neither my wife, nor myself, nor Indra himself who while passing through the firmament had seen my wife, could he held to have committed any sin. The blame really is the result of the carelessness of my Yoga power.</p>
<p id='51'><a href='#51'></a>ईर्ष्याजं व्यसनं प्राहुस्तेन चैवोर्ध्व रेतसः। ईर्ष्णया त्वहमाक्षिप्तो मग्नो दुष्कृतसागरे॥<br />The sages have said that all calamities originate from envy, which, in its turn, springs from mistaken judgement. By that envy, also, I have been dragged from where I was plunged into an ocean of sin.</p>
