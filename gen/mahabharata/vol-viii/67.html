<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 240</h3><h4>The doctrine of knowledge according the Yoga system</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>व्यास उवाच पृच्छतस्तव सत्पुत्र यथावदिह तत्त्वतः। सांख्यज्ञानेन संयुक्तं यदेतत् कीर्तितं मया॥<br />Vyasa said O excellent son, accosted by you. I have told you truly what the answer to your question should be according to the doctrine of Knowledge as explained in the Sankhya system.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>योगकृत्ये तु ते कृत्स्नं वर्तयिष्यामि तच्छृणु। एकत्वं बुद्धिमनसारिन्द्रियाणां च सर्वशः॥ आत्मनो व्यापिनस्तात ज्ञानमेतदनुत्तमम्। तदेतदुपशान्तेन दान्तेनाध्यात्मशीलिना॥ आत्मारामेण बुद्धेन बोद्धव्यं शुचिकर्मणा। योगदोषान् समुच्छिद्य पञ्च यान् कवयो विदुः॥ कामं क्रोधं च लोभं च भयं स्वप्नं च पञ्चमम्। क्रोधं शमेन जयति कामं संकल्पवर्जनात्॥<br />Listen now to me as I explain to you all that should be done according to the Yoga doctrine. The unison of intellect and Mind, and all the Senses, and the all-prevading Soul is said to be the highest kind of knowledge. That Knowledge should be gained by one who is of a tranquil mind, who has governed his senses, who is capable of seeing the Soul, who takes pleasure in (such) meditation, who is gifted with intelligence and purity in acts. One should try to gain this knowledge by abandoning those five obstacles of Yoga which are known to the wise, namely, desire, anger, cupidity, fear, and sleep. Anger is conquered by tranquility of disposition. Desire is defeated by giving up all purposes.</p>

One should pay his adorations to fire and the Brahmanas and should bow his head to the gods.</p>

When these with the mind for the sixth become concentrated in the understanding, and thus centred remain steady and firm then Brahma becomes perceptible like a smokeless blazing fire or the effulgent Sun.</p>
