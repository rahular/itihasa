<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 223</h3><h4>By following what intelligence can a king born of prosperity live on earth</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच यथा बुद्ध्या महीपालो भ्रष्टश्रीविचरेन्महीम्। कालदण्डविनिष्पिष्टस्तन्मे ब्रूहि पितामह॥<br />Yudhisthira said Tell me, O grandfather, by adopting what sort of intelligence may a king, who has been divested of prosperity and crushed by Time's heavy bludgeon, still live on this Earth.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>भीष्म उवाच अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। वासवस्य च संवादं बलेवैरोचनस्य च॥<br />Regarding it is cited the old discourse between Vasava and Virochana's son Vali.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>पितामहमुपागम्य प्रणिपत्यकृताञ्जलिः। सर्वानेवासुरान् जित्वा बलिं पप्रच्छ वासवः॥<br />After having defeated all the Assuras, one day Vasava went to the Grandfather and joining his hands bowed to him and enquired after the whereabouts of Vali.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>यस्य स्म ददतो वित्तं न कदाचन हीयते। तं बलिं नाधिगच्छामि ब्रह्मन्नाचक्ष्व मे बलिम्॥<br />Tell me, O Brahman, where may I now find that Vali whose wealth continued undiminished even though he used to distribute it as largely as he wished.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>स वायुर्वरुणश्चैव स रविः स च चन्द्रमाः। सोऽग्निस्तपति भूतानि जलं च स भवत्युत॥<br />He was the god of wind. He was Varuna. He was Surya. He was Soma. He was Agni that used to warm all creatures. He became water. I do not find where he now is. Indeed, O Brahmana, tell me where I may find Vali now.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>तं बलिं नाधिगच्छामि ब्रह्मन्नाचक्ष्व मे बलिम्। स एव ह्यस्तमयते स स्म विद्योतते दिशः॥ स वर्षति स्म वर्षाणि यथाकालमतन्द्रितः। तं बलिं नाधिगच्छामि ब्रह्मन्नाचक्ष्व मे बलिम्॥<br />Formerly, it was he who used to light up all the cardinal points and to set. Shaking off idieness, it was he who used to pour rain upon all creatures at the proper season. I do not now see that Vali. Indeed, tell me, O Brahman, where I may find that king of the Asuras now.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>ब्रह्मोवाच नैतत् ते साधु मघवन् यदेनमनुपृच्छसि। पृष्टस्तु नानृतं ब्रूयात् तस्माद् वक्ष्यामि ते बलिम्॥<br />Brahman said You should not, O Maghavat, thus enquire after Vali now! One should not, however, speak a falsehood when he is questioned by another. I shall tell you the whereabouts of Vali.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>उष्टेषु यदि वा गोषु खरेष्वश्वेषु वा पुनः। वरिष्ठो भविता जन्तुः शून्यागारे शचीपते॥<br />O husband of Sachi, Vali may now have taken his birth among camels or bulls or asses or horses, and having become the foremost of his species may now be living in an empty room.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>शक्र उवाच यदि स्म बलिना ब्रह्मशून्यागारे समेयिवान्। हन्यामेनं न वा हन्यां तद् ब्रह्मन्ननुशाधि माम्॥<br />Shakra said 'If, O Brahman, I happen to meet with Vali in an empty room, shall I kill him or spare him? Tell me how I shall act!'</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>ब्रह्मोवाच मा स्म शक्र बलिं हिंसीन बलिर्वधमर्हति। न्यायस्तु शक्र प्रष्टव्यस्त्वया वासव काम्यया॥<br />Brahma said 'Do not, O Shakra, injure Vali! Vali does not deserve death. You should, on the other hand, O Vasava, seek instruction from him about morality, O Shakra, as you wish,'</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>एवमुक्तो भगवता महेन्द्रः पृथिवीं तदा। चचारैरावतस्कन्धमधिरुह्य श्रिया वृतः॥<br />‘Thus addressed by the divine Creator, Indra travelled over the Earth, seated on Airavata in great splendour.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>ततो ददर्श स बलिं खरवेषेण संवृतम्। यथाऽऽख्यातं भगवता शून्यागारकृतालयम्॥<br />He succeeded in meeting with Vali, who, as the Creator had said, was living in an empty room, clothed in the form of an ass.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>शक्र उवाच खरयोनिमनुप्राप्तस्तुषभक्षोऽसि दानव। इयं ते योनिरधमा शोचस्याहो न शोचसि॥<br />'You are now, O Danava, born as an ass living on chaff. This your birth is certainly a low one. Do you or do you not grieve for it?</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>अदृष्टं बत पश्यामि द्विषतां वशामागतम्। श्रिया विहीनं मित्रैश्च भ्रष्टवीर्यपराक्रमम्॥<br />I see what I had never seen before, viz., yourself brought under the control of your enemies, divested of prosperity and friends, and shorn of energy and prowess.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>यत् तद् यानसहौस्त्वं ज्ञातिभिः परिवारितः। लोकान् प्रतापयन् सर्वान् यास्यस्मानवितर्कयन्॥<br />Formerly you used to march through the words, with your train consisting of thousands of carriages and thousands of kinsmen, and to move along, burning, everybody with your splendour and disregarding us all.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>त्वन्मुखाश्चैव दैतेय व्यतिष्ठंस्त्व शासने। अकृष्टपच्या च मही तवैश्वर्ये बभूव ह॥<br />Considering you as their protector the Daityas lived under your sway! Through your power, the Earth used to yield crops without waiting for tillage. To-day, however, I behold you overtaken by this dire calamity! Do you or do you not grieve for this.</p>
