He is both the sacrifice that is performed and the sacrificer who celebrates the sacrifice. He is the ancient and the infinite Purusha.

Towards the evening of Brahman's day, Aniruddha became filled with anger, and as a consequence of this, there originated from his forehead a son called Rudra gifted with the power of destroying everything. These two, viz., Brahman and Rudra, are the foremost of all the gods, having originated respectively from the Cheerfulness and the Anger (of Aniruddha).</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>तदादेशितपन्थानौ सृष्टिसंहारकारकौ॥ निमित्तमात्रं तावत्र सर्वप्राणिवरप्रदौ।<br />Acting according to Aniruddha's directions, these two gods Create and Destroy.

Among them all, they that are devoted to me wholly and do not worship any other god, are the foremost. I am the end they seek, and though engaged in deeds, they never seek the fruits thereof.</p>
<p id='29'><a href='#29'></a>ये च शिष्टास्त्रयो भक्ताः फलकामा हि ते मताः। सर्वे च्यवनधर्मास्ते प्रतिबुद्धस्तु श्रेष्ठभाक्॥<br />The three remaining classes of my worshippers are those who seek the fruits of their acts. They acquire regions of great happiness, but then they have to drop down therefrom upon the exhaustion of their merits. Those amongst my worshippers, therefore, who are fully awakened obtain what is foremost.</p>
<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>ब्रह्माणं शितिकण्ठं च याश्चान्या देवताः स्मृताः। प्रबुद्धचर्याः सेवन्तो मामेवैष्यन्ति यत् परम्॥<br />Those who are awakened and whose conduct shows such enlightenment, may be engaged in worshipping Brahman or Mahadeva or the other gods who live in heaven, but they succeed at least in getting to myself.</p>
