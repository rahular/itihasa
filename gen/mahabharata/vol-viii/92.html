<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 265</h3><h4>The story of king Vicharakhu about sacrifices</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच भीष्म अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। प्रजारनामनुकम्पार्थं गीतं राज्ञा विचख्नुना॥<br />Bhishma said Regarding it is cited an old discourse of what was recited by king Vicharakhu through pity for all creatures.</p>
<p id='2'>छिन्नस्थूणं वृषं दृष्ट्वा विलापं च गवां भृशम्। गोग्रहे यज्ञवाटस्य प्रेक्षमाणः स पार्थिवः॥ स्वस्ति गोभ्योऽस्तु लोकेषु ततो निर्वचनं कृतम्। हिंसायां हि प्रवृत्तायामाशीरेषा तु कल्पिता॥<br />Seeing the mangled body of a bull, and hearing the highly painful groans of the kine in a cow-killing sacrifice, and observing the cruel Brahmanas collected there for assisting at the ceremonies, that king said these words:Prosperity to all the kine in the world!-When the slaughter had begun, these</p>
<p id='3'>अव्यवस्थितमर्यादैविमूढ स्तिकैनरैः। संशयात्मभिरव्यक्तैर्हिसा समनुवर्णिता॥<br />And the king further said,-Only those who transgress fixed limits, who are shorn of intelligence, who are atheists and sceptics, and who desire the acquisition of celebrity by sacrifices and religious rites, speak highly of the destruction of animals in sacrifices.</p>
<p id='4'>सर्वकर्मस्वहिंसा हि धर्मात्मा मनुरब्रवीत्। कामकाराद् विहिंसन्ति बहिर्वेद्यां पशून् नराः॥<br />The pious Manu has spoken highly of harmlessness in all acts. Indeed, men kill animals in sacrifices, actuated only by the desire of fruit. an a</p>
<p id='5'>तस्मात् प्रमाणत: कार्यो धर्मः सूक्ष्मो विजानता। अहिंसा सर्वभूतेभ्यो धर्मेभ्यो ज्यायसी मता॥<br />Hence, guided by authority one conversant (with the scriptures) should practise the true course of duty which is highly subtile. Harmlessness to all creatures is the highest of all duties.</p>
<p id='6'>उपोष्य संशितो भूत्वा हित्वा वेदकृताः श्रुतीः। आचार इत्यनाचारः कृपणा: फलहेतवः॥<br />Living near inhabited place and practising rigid vows, and disregarding the fruits of Vedic acts, one should give up the life of house-holder, adopting that of Renunciation. Only they who are mean are actuated by the desire of fruit.</p>
<p id='7'>यदि यज्ञांश्च वृक्षांश्च यूपांश्चोद्दिश्य मानवाः। वृथा मांसं न खादन्ति नैष धर्मः प्रशस्यते॥<br />Mentioning respectfully sacrifices and trees and sacrificial stakes, men do not eat tainted meat. This practice, however, is now worthy of praise.</p>
<p id='8'>सुरा मत्स्या मधु मासंमासवं कृसरौदनम्। धूर्तेः प्रवर्तितं ह्येतन्नैतद् वेदेषु कल्पितम्॥<br />Knavas have introduced wine, fish, honey, meat, alchohol, and preparations of rice and sesame seeds. The use of these is not sanctioned in the Vedas.</p>
<p id='9'>मानान्मोहाच्च लोभाच्च लौल्यमेतत्प्रकल्पितम्। विष्णुमेवाभिजानन्ति सर्वयज्ञेषु ब्राह्मणाः॥<br />The hankering after these originates from pride, error of judgement, and cupidity. The Brahmanas realise the presence of Vishnu in every sacrifice.</p>
<p id='10'>पायसैः सुमनोभिश्च तस्यापि यजनं स्मृतम्। यज्ञियाश्चैव ये वृक्षा वेदेषु परिकल्पिता:॥ यच्चापि किंचित् कर्तव्यमन्यच्चोक्षैः सुसंस्कृतम्। महासत्त्वैः शुद्धभावैः सर्वं देवार्हमेव तत्॥<br />His adoration, it has been laid down, should be made with sweet Payasa. (The leaves and flower of such trees as have been mentioned in the Vedas, whatever act is considered as worthy and whatever else is held as pure by persons of pure hearts and purified natures and those eminent for knowledge and holiness, are well worthy of being offered to the Supreme God and not unworthy of His acceptance.</p>
<p id='11'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच शरीरमापदश्चापि विवदन्त्यविहिंसतः। कथं यात्रा शरीरस्य निरारम्भस्य सेत्स्यते॥<br />Yudhishthira said The body and all sorts of dangers and calamities continually fight with each other, How, therefore, will a person who is absolutely free from the desire of injuring and who on this account will not be able to act succeed in maintaining his body.</p>
<p id='12'>भीष्म उवाच यथा शरीरं न ग्लायेन्येयान्मृत्युवशं यथा। तथा कर्मसु वर्तेत समर्थो धर्ममाचरेत्॥<br />Bhishma said One should, when able, acquire merit and act in such a way that his body may not languish and suffer pain, and that death may not come.</p>
