<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 177</h3><h4>The root of happiness, The story of Manki</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच ईहमानः समारम्भान् यदि नासादयेद् धनम्। धनतृष्णाभिभूतश्च किं कुर्वन् सुखमाप्नुयात्॥<br />Yudhishthira said If any person, desirous of accomplishing acts of charity and sacrifices, fails to find (the necessary) wealth, and thirst of wealth gets the better of him, what course should he pursue to obtain happiness?</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>भीष्म उवाच सर्वसाम्यमनायासं सत्यवाक्यं च भारत। निर्वेदश्चाविधित्सा च यस्य स्यात् स सुखी नरः॥<br />He who makes no difference between two opposite agents, viz., pleasure and pain, honour and insult, etc., who never troubles himself for the gratification of his desire for worldly possessions, who observes veracity of speech, who has freed himself from all kinds of attachment, and who has renounced his desire for action, is, O Bharata, a happy man.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>एतान्येव पदान्याहुः पञ्च वृद्धाः प्रशान्तये। एष स्वर्गश्च धर्मश्च सुखं चानुत्तमं मतम्॥<br />The ancients say these are the five means by which perfect tranquility or emancipation could be obtained. These are called Heaven. These are Religion. These form the highest happiness.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। निर्वेदान्मङ्किना गीतं तन्निबोध युधिष्ठिर॥<br />Regarding it is cited the old story of what Manki had sung, when freed from attachments. Hear it, O Yudhishthira.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>ईहमानो धनं मङ्किर्भग्नेहश्च पुनः पुनः। केनचिद्धनशेषेण क्रीतवान् दम्यगोयुगम्॥<br />Manki, desirous of wealth, found that he was doomed to an unending series of disappointinents. With a little remnant of his property hc purchased at last a couple of young bulls with a yoke for training them (to pastoral labour).</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>सुसम्बद्धौ तु तौ दम्यौ दमनायाभिनिःसृतौ। आसीनमुष्ट्रं मध्येन सहसैवाभ्यधावताम्॥ तयोः सम्प्राप्तयोरुष्ट्रः स्कन्धदेशममर्षणः। उत्थायोक्षिप्य तौ दम्यौ प्रससार महाजवः॥<br />One day the two bulls, properly yoked, were taken out for training (in the fields). Shying at the sight of a camel which was lying down on the road, the animals suddenly ran towards the camel, and fell upon its neck. Enraged at finding the bulls fall upon its neck, the camel, possessed of great speed, got up and ran with full speed, bearing away the two helpless creatures dangling on either side of its neck.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>ह्रियमाणौ तु तौ दम्यौ तेनोष्ट्रेण प्रमाथिना। नियमाणौ च सम्प्रेक्ष्य मङ्किस्तत्राब्रवीदिदम्॥ न चैवाविहितं शक्यं दक्षणापीहितुं धनम्। युक्तेन श्रद्धया सम्यगीहां समनुतिष्ठता॥<br />Beholding his two bulls thus carried away by the strong camel, and seeing that they were: on the point of death, Manki began to say,-If it is not ordained by destiny, wealth can never be obtained even by a clever man strenuously and confidently striving and skilfully doing all that is necessary towards the accomplishment of his object.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>कृतस्य पूर्वं चानथैर्युक्तस्याप्यनुतिष्ठतः। इमं पश्यत संगत्या मम दैवमहपप्लवम्॥<br />I had, all along, tried by all manner and means, and with great devotion, to acquire riches. But all this misfortune to my property is due to Destiny.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>उद्यम्योद्यम्य मे दम्यौ विषमेणैव गच्छतः। उत्क्षिप्य काकतालीयमुत्पथेनैव धावतः॥<br />My bulls are carried away, rising and falling, as the camel is running in the uneven course. This event seems to be an accident like the one brought about by the crow to a ripe fruit while perching on a palmyra free.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>मणी वोष्ट्रस्य लम्बेते प्रियौ वत्सतरौ मम। शुद्धं हि दैव्मेवेदं हठेनैवास्ति पौरुषम्॥<br />Alas, those dear bulls of mine are dangling on the camel's neck like a couple of gems! This is the result of Destiny alone. Exertion is of no avail in what is due to Chance.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>यदि वाप्युपपद्येत पौरुषं नाम कर्हिचित् अन्विष्यमाणं तदपि दैवमेवावतिष्ठते॥<br />Or, if the existence of anything like Exertion (as a resulting factor) be admitted, a little more scrutiny would find that Destiny is at the bottom.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>तस्मानिर्वेद एवेह गन्तव्यः सुखमिच्छता। सुखं स्वपिति निर्विण्णो निराशश्चार्थसाधने॥<br />Therefore, he who is desirous of happiness, should renounce all attachment. He who is indifferent to worldly surroundings, has renounced all desires for acquiring wealth, can sleep happily.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>अहो सम्यक् शुकेनोक्तं सर्वतः परिमुच्यता। प्रतिष्ठता महारण्यं जनकस्य निवेशनात्॥<br />He, it was well-said by Shuka while going to the great forest from his father's house, renouncing everything.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>यः कामानाप्नुयात् सर्वान् यश्चैतान् केवलांस्त्यजेत्। प्रापणात् सर्वकामानां परित्यागो विशिष्यते॥<br />Amongst these two, viz., one who obtains the fruition of all his desires, and one who renounces all desires, the latter, who casts off everything is superior to the first who obtains the fruition of all his desires.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>नान्तं सर्वविधित्सानां गतपूर्वोऽस्ति कश्चन। शरीरे जीविते चैव तृष्णा मन्दस्य वर्धते॥<br />No one could ever attain to the end of desire. Only he who is destitute of knowledge and judgement feels and avidity for protecting his body and life.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>निवर्तस्व विधित्साभ्यः शाम्य निर्विद्य कामुक असकृच्चासि निकृतो न च निर्विद्यसे ततः॥<br />Renounce all desire for action. O my Soul which has become a prey of cupidity, adopt tranquillity by freeling yourself from all worldly attachments. Repeatedly have you been cheated (by phantomis of hope). How is it that you do not still free yourself from attachments?</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>यदि नाहं विनाश्यस्ते यद्येवं रमसे मया। मा मां योजय लोभेन वृथा त्वं वित्तकामुक॥<br />If I am not one who deserves to be crushed by you, if I am one with whom you should play in delight, then, O my wealth-coveting Soul, do not induce me towards cupidity.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>संचितं संचितं द्रव्यं नष्टं तव पुनः पुनः। कदाचिन्मोक्ष्यसे मूढ धनेहां धनकामुक॥<br />You have now and again lost your hoarded wealth! O my wealth-covering and foolish Soul, when will you succeed in getting rid of your desire for wealth?</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>अहो न मम बालिश्यं योऽहं क्रीडनकस्तव। किं नैवं जातु पुरुषः परेषां प्रेष्यतामियात्॥<br />Shame on my foolishness. I have become a toy of yours. It is thus that one becomes a slave of others.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>न पूर्वे नापरे जातु कामानामन्तमाप्नुवन्। त्यक्त्वा सर्वसमारम्भान् प्रतिबुद्धोऽस्मि जागृमि॥<br />No one born on Earth did ever attain to the end of desire, and no one who will be born hereafter will succeed in attaining to it. Renouncing all acts, I have at last been roused from sleep. I am now awake.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>नूनं ते हृदयं काम वज्रसारमयं दृढम्। यदनर्थशताविष्टं शतधा न विदीर्यते॥<br />Without doubt, O Desire, your heart is hard like that of an adamant, since though affected by a hundred reverses, you do not break into as many fragments.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>जानामि काम त्वां चैव यच्च किंचित् प्रियं तव। तवाहं प्रियमन्विच्छन्नात्मन्युपलभे सुखम्॥<br />I know you, O Desire, and all those things that are dear to you. Seeking what is dear to you, I shall feel happiness in my own Self.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>काम जानामि ते मूलं संकल्पात् किल जायसे। न त्वां संकल्पयिष्यामि समूलो न भविष्यसि॥<br />O desire, I know your origin. You originate from Will. I shall, therefore, avoid Will. You will then be rooted out.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>ईहा धनस्य न सुखं लब्ध्वा चिन्ता च भूयसी। लब्धनाशे यथा मृत्युर्लब्धं भवति वा न वा॥<br />The desire for wealth can never yield happiness. If acquired, the acquirer feels great anxiety. If lost after acquisition it is felt like death. Again acquisition itself, is very uncertain.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>परित्यागे न लभते ततो दुःखतरं नु किम्। न च तुष्यति लब्धेन भूय एव च मार्गति॥<br />Wealth cannot be secured by even the surrender of one's person. What can be more painful than this? When acquired, one is never gratified with its quantity, but one continues to hanker after it.</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>अनुतर्षुल एवार्थः स्वादु गाङ्गमिवोदकम्। मद्विलापनमेतत्तु प्रतिबुद्धोऽस्मि संत्यज॥<br />Like the sweet water of the Ganges, riches only enhances one's hankering. It is my destruction. I am now awakened. Do you, O desire, leave me.</p>
<p id='27'><a href='#27'></a>य इमं मामकं देहं भूतग्रामः समाश्रितः। स यात्वितो यथाकामं वसतां वा यथासुखम्॥<br />May that desire which resides in this my body,-this compound of (five), elements,-go wherever it likes and live happily wherever it likes.</p>
<p id='28'><a href='#28'></a>न युष्मास्विह मे प्रीतिः कामलोभानुसारिषु। तस्मादुत्सृज्य कामान् वै सत्त्वमेवाश्रयाम्यहम्॥<br />I do not like you all who are not of the Soul, for you bring on Desire and Cupidity! Forsaking all of you I shall seek refuge with the quality of Goodness.</p>
<p id='29'><a href='#29'></a>सर्वभूतान्यहं देहे पश्यन् मनसि चात्मनः। योगे बुद्धिं श्रुते सत्त्वं मनो ब्रह्मणि धारयन्॥ विहरिष्याम्यनासक्तः सुखी लोकान् निरामयः। यया मां त्वं पुन:वं दुःखेषु प्रणिधास्यसि॥<br />Seeing all creatures in my own body and my own mind, and devoting my reason to Yoga, my life to the instructions of the wise, and soul to Brahma, I shall happily rove through the world, without attachment and without calamities of any kind, so that you may not be able to plunge me again into such sorrows.</p>
<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>त्वया हि मे प्रणुन्नस्य गतिरन्या न विद्यते। तृष्णाशोकश्रमाणां हि त्वं काम प्रभवः सदा॥<br />If I continue to be unruffled by you, O desire, I shall necessarily be without a path (by which to effect my salvation). You O desire, are always the parent of thirst, of sorrow, and of fatigue and toil.</p>
<p id='31'><a href='#31'></a>धननाशेऽधिकं दुःखं मन्ये सर्वमहत्तरम्। ज्ञातयो ह्यवमन्यन्ते मित्राणि च धनाच्च्युतम्॥<br />I consider the sorrow that one feels at the loss of wealth is proportionately greater than what one feels under any other adverse circumstance. Relatives and friends forsake him who has lost his wealth.</p>
<p id='32'><a href='#32'></a>अवज्ञानसहौस्तु दोषाः कष्टतराऽधने। धने सुखकला या तु सापि दुःखैर्विधीयते॥<br />With all sorts of humiliation numbering by thousands, there are many other faults in property which are even much more painful. On the other hand, the very small happiness that resides in wealth is mingled with pain and sorrow.</p>
<p id='33'><a href='#33'></a>धनमस्येति पुरुषं पुरो निमन्ति दस्यवः। क्लिश्यन्ति विविधैर्दण्डैनित्यमुद्वेजयन्ति च॥<br />Robbers kill, in the sight of all, the person who has riches, or torment him with all sorts of severity, or put him into fright now and again.</p>
<p id='34'><a href='#34'></a>अर्थलोलुपता दुःखमिति बुद्धं चिरान्मया। यद् यदालम्बसे काम तत्तदेवानुरुध्यसे।॥ अतत्त्वज्ञोऽसि बालश्च दुस्तोषोऽपूरणोऽनलः।<br />At last, after a long time, I have realised that the desire for wealth is attended with sorrow. Whatever the object, O desire, upon which you set your heart, you force me to follow it! You are without judgement. You are a fool. You are difficult of being satisfied. You can never be contented. You burn like fire.</p>
<p id='35'><a href='#35'></a>नैव त्वं वेत्थ सुलभं नैव त्वं वेत्थ दुर्लभम्॥ पाताल इव दुष्पूरो मां दुःखैर्योक्तुमिच्छसि। नाहमद्य समावेष्टुं शक्यः काम पुनस्त्वया॥<br />You do not enquire when following the object you pursue, whether it is easy or difficult of attainment. Like the nether region you cannot be filled to the brim. You wish to cast into grief. From this day, O desire, I am incapable of living with you.</p>
<p id='36'><a href='#36'></a>निर्वेदमहमासाद्य द्रव्यनाशाद् यदृच्छया। निर्वृत्तिं परमां प्राप्य नाद्य कामान् विचिन्तये॥<br />I who was disappointed, at first, at the loss of my property, have now attained to the high state of perfect freedom from attachments. At this moment I no longer think of you and your train. I</p>
<p id='37'><a href='#37'></a>अतिक्लेशान् सहामीह नाहं बुद्ध्याम्बुद्धिमान्। निकृतो धननाशेन शय सर्वाङ्गविज्वरः॥<br />I had, before this, felt great misery on your account. I do not (now) regard myself as devoid of intelligence. Having taken to Renunciation on account of the loss of my property, I now can .rest, being freed from every kind of fever.</p>
<p id='38'><a href='#38'></a>परित्यजामि काम त्वा हित्वा सर्वमनोगती:। न त्वं मया पुनः काम वत्स्यसे न च रंस्यसे॥<br />I cast you off, O Desire, with all the passions of my heart. You shall not, again, find any place in me nor shall you sport with me.</p>
<p id='39'><a href='#39'></a>क्षमिष्ये क्षिपमाणानां न हिसिष्ये विहिंसितः। द्वेष्ययुक्तः प्रियं वक्ष्यासम्यनादृत्य तदप्रियम्॥<br />I shall forgive them who will slander or speak ill of me. I shall not harm even when I am injured. If anybody from aversion speaks disparagingly of me, without caring for those disagrccable words shall greet him courteously. With a contented heart and with an easy mind, I shall always live upon what I may obtain for myself.</p>
<p id='40'><a href='#40'></a>तृप्तः स्वस्थेन्द्रियो नित्यं यथालब्धेन वर्तयन्। न सकामं करिष्यामि त्वामहं शत्रुमात्मनः॥ निर्वेदं निर्वृतिं तृप्तिं शान्ति सत्यं दमं क्षमाम्। सर्वभूतदयां चैव विद्धि मां समुपागतम्॥<br />I shall not gratify those wishes of yours which are inimical to me. Indifference to worldly concerns, renunciation, contentment, tranquillity, veracity, self-control, forgiveness, and universal mercy, have now come to be my qualifications.</p>
<p id='41'><a href='#41'></a>तस्मात् कामश्च लोभश्च तृष्णा कार्पण्यमेव च। त्यजन्तु मां प्रतिष्ठन्तं सत्त्वस्थो ह्यस्मि साम्प्रतम्॥<br />Therefore, let Desire, Cupidity, Thirst, and Miserliness, bid me aided. I have now taken to the path of Goodness.</p>
<p id='42'><a href='#42'></a>प्रहाय कामं लोभं च सुखं प्राप्तोऽस्मि साम्प्रतम्। नाद्य लोभवशं प्राप्तो दुःखं प्राप्स्याम्यनात्मवान्॥<br />Having renounced Desire and Cupidity, my happiness has now been great. I shall no longer surrender myself to the influence of Cupidity, nor shall I undergo the pangs of misery like a person of impure soul.</p>
<p id='43'><a href='#43'></a>यद् यत् त्यजति कामानां तत् सुखस्याभिपूर्यते। कामस्य वशगो नित्यं दुःखमेव प्रपद्यते॥<br />Inasmuch as one renounces his desires so sure is he to reap his deserts. Truly he who surrenders himself to Desire always undergoes the pangs of misery.</p>
<p id='44'><a href='#44'></a>कामानुबन्धं नुदते यत् किंचित् पुरुषो रजः। कामक्राधोद्भवं दुःखमहाररतिरव च॥<br />Whatever passions arising from Desire are cast off by a person, all come under the category of Passion. Sorrow and shamelessness, as also discontent, all owe their origin to Desire and Wealth.</p>
<p id='45'><a href='#45'></a>एष ब्रह्मप्रतिष्ठोऽहं ग्रीष्मे शीतमिव ह्रदम्। शाम्यामि परिनिर्वामि सुखं मामेति केवलम्॥<br />As in the hot summery a person plunges himself into a cool lake, I have now merged myself into Brahma. I have renounced work. I have extricated myself from grief. Unalloyed happiness has now come to my share.</p>
<p id='46'><a href='#46'></a>यच्च कामसुखं लोके यच्च दिव्यं महत्सुखम्। तृष्णाक्षयसुखस्यैते नार्हतः षोडशी कलाम्॥<br />The happiness which results from the fruition of Desire, or the serene happiness which one enjoys in heaven, is not equal to a sixteenth part of that which springs from renunciation of all kinds of thirst.</p>
<p id='47'><a href='#47'></a>आत्मना सप्तमं कामं हत्वा शत्रुमिवोत्तमम्। : प्राप्यावध्यं ब्रह्मपुरं राजेव स्यामहं सुखी॥<br />Laying axe at the root of desire, which with the body makes an aggregate of seven, and which is a bitter foe, I have made my way to the immortal city of Brahma and there shall I pass my days in happiness like a king.</p>
<p id='48'><a href='#48'></a>एतां बुद्धिं समास्थाय मङ्किनिर्वेदमागतः। सर्वान् कामान् परित्यज्य प्राप्य ब्रह्म महत्सुखम्॥<br />Putting his faith upon such, intelligence, Manki succeeded in freeing himself from attachments, by his self-renunciation and obtained the blissful region of Brahma.</p>
<p id='49'><a href='#49'></a>दम्यनाशकृते मङ्किरमृतत्वं किलागमत्। अच्छिनत् काममूलं स तेन प्राप महत्सुखम्॥<br />Forsooth, on account of the loss of his two bulls, Manki attained to immortality. In fact, because he laid the axe at the very roots of desire, he succeeded, through that means to obtain for himself supreme happiness.</p>
