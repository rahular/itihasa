<h3>MOKSHADHARMA PARVA: Chapter 300</h3><h4>The difference between Sankhya and Yoga systems of philosophy</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच सांख्ये योगे च मे तात विशेषं वक्तुमर्हसि। तव धर्मज्ञ सर्वं हि विदितं कुरुसत्तम॥<br />Yudhishthira said You should explain to me, O sire, what the difference is between the Sankhya and the Yoga systems of philosophy. O foremost one of Kuru's race, you know everything is known, O you who are conversant with all duties.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>भीष्म उवाच सांख्याः सांख्यं प्रशंसन्ति योगा योगं द्विजातयः। वदन्ति कारणं श्रेष्ठं स्वपक्षोद्भावनाय व॥<br />Bhishma said The followers of Sankhya praise the Sankhya system and the Yogins praise the Yoga system. For fixing the superiority of their respective systems, each calls his own system to be better.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>अनीश्वरः कथं मुच्येदित्येवं शत्रुकर्शन। वदन्ति कारणैः श्रेष्ठ्यं योगाः सम्यङ्मनीषिणः॥<br />Wise men devoted to Yoga point out proper and very good reasons, O crusher of enemies, for showing that one who does not believe in the existence of God cannot acquire Liberation.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>वदन्ति कारणं चेदं सांख्याः सम्यग् द्विजातयः। विज्ञायेह गती: सर्वा विरक्तो विषयेषु यः॥ उर्ध्वं स देहात् सुव्यक्तं विमुच्येदिति नान्यथा। एतदाहुमहाप्राज्ञाः सांख्ये वै मोक्षदर्शनम्॥<br />Those twice-born ones, again, who are believers in the Sankhya doctrines forward good reasons for showing that a person by acquiring true knowledge of all objects, becomes dissociated from all earthly objects, and, after death, it is plain, becomes liberated and that it cannot be otherwise. Men of great wisdom have thus expounded the Sankhya philosophy of Liberation.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>स्वपक्षे कारणं ग्राह्यं समये वचनं हितम्। शिष्टानां हि मतं ग्राह्यं त्वद्विधैः शिष्टसम्मतैः॥<br />When reasons are thus equally placed on both sides, those are assigned on that side which one is otherwise inclined to follow as one's own, should be accepted. Indeed, those words that are said on that side should be considered as wholesome. Good men may be found on both sides. Persons like you may adot either opinion.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>प्रत्यक्षहेतवो योगा: सांख्या: शास्त्रविनिश्चयाः। उभे चैते मते तत्त्वे मम तात युधिष्ठिर॥<br />The evidences of Yoga are addressed to the direct perception of the senses; those of Sankhya are based on the scriptures. Both I systems of philosophy are approved by me, O Yudhishthira.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>उभे चैते मते ज्ञाते नृपते शिष्टसम्मते। अनुष्ठिते यथाशास्त्रं नेयतां परमां गतिम्॥ तुल्यं शौचं तपोयुक्तं दया भूतेषु चानघ। व्रतानां धारणं तुल्यं दर्शनं न समं तयोः॥<br />agree with noth those systems of science, O king, so do the good and wise. If practised duly according to the instructions laid down, both would, O king, make a person acquire the highest end. In both systems purity is equally recommended as also mercy towards all creatures, O sinless one. In both, again, the observance of vows has been equally sanctioned. Only the scriptures which point out their paths are different.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच यदि तुल्यं व्रतं शौचं दया चात्र फलं तथा। न तुल्यं दर्शनं कस्मात् तन्मे ब्रूहि पितामह॥<br />Yudhishthira said If the vows, the purity, the mercy, and the fruits thereof recommended in both systems be the same, tell me, O grandfather, why then are not their scriptures the same?</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>भीष्म उवाच रागं मोहं तथा स्नेहं कामं क्रोधं च केवलम्। योगाच्छित्त्वा ततो दोषान् पञ्चैतान् प्राप्नुवन्ति तत्॥<br />Bhishma said By renouncing through the help of Yoga, these five faults, viz., attachment carelessness, affection, lust and anger one acquires Liberation.</p>
