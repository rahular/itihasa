I wish to hear you recite the story. My curiosity about it is irrepressible.</p>
<p id='2'>अव्यक्तव्यक्ततत्त्वानां निश्चयं बुद्धिनिश्चयम्। वक्तुमर्हसि कौरव्य देवस्याजस्य या कृतिः॥<br />You should, O you of Kuru's race, describe to me on the conclusions about the Unmanifest, the Manifest, and of the Truth (or Brahma) that is in, but unattached to, them, as also of the acts of self-create Narayana, as they are known to you.</p>
<p id='3'>भीष्म उवाच प्राकृतेन सुवृत्तेन चरन्तमकुतोभयम्। अध्याप्य कृस्त्नं स्वाध्यायमन्वशाद् वै पिता सुतम्॥<br />Bhishma said Seeing his son Shuka living fearlessly as ordinary men do in practices that are regarded innocent by them, Vyasa taught him the entire Vedas and then discoursed to him one day in following manner.</p>
<p id='4'>व्यास उवाच धर्मं पुत्र निषेवस्व सुतीक्ष्णौ च हिमातपौ। क्षुत्पिपासे च वायुंच जय नित्यं जितेन्द्रियः॥<br />Vyasa said O son, becoming the master of your senses, do you conquer extreme cold and extreme heat, hunger and thirst, and the wind also, and having controlled them, do you practise virtue.</p>

<p id='7'>फेनमात्रोपमो देहे जीवे शकुनिवत् स्थिते। अनित्ये प्रियसंवासे कथं स्वपिषि पुत्रक॥<br />Your body is as fickle as the froth on the surface of water. The Individual Soul is sitting unattached in it as a bird on a tree. The companionship of all agreeable objects is transitory. Why then, O son, do you sleep in such forgetfulness?</p>
<p id='8'>अप्रमत्तेषु जाग्रत्सु नित्ययुक्तेषु शत्रुषु। अन्तरं लिप्समानेषु बालस्त्वं नावबुध्यसे॥<br />Your enemies are careful and awake and ever-ready (to assail you) and always watchful of their opportunity. Why are you so foolish as not to know this?</p>
<p id='9'>अहःसु गण्यमानेषु क्षीयमाणे तथाऽऽयुषि। जीविते लिख्यमाने च किमुत्थाय न धावसि॥<br />As the days are going one after another, and period of your life is being decreased. Indeed, when your life is being continually shortened, why do you not run to preceptors?</p>

The man who follows those misguided persons that have taken to devious and wrong paths is afflicted equally with them.</p>
<p id='12'>ये तु तुष्टाः श्रुतिपरा महात्मानो महाबलाः। धर्म्य पन्थानमारूढास्तानुपास्स्व च पृच्छ च॥<br />They, however, who are contented, devoted to the scriptures, gifted with high souls, and possessed of great might, follow the path of virtue. Do you wait upon them with respect and seek instruction from them.</p>

With understanding purified by such instructions and made superior, do you then control your heart which is ever ready to deviate from the right course.</p>
