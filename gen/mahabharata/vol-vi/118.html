<h3>SHALYA PARVA: Chapter 22</h3><h4>The fight between Duryodhana and the sons of Pandu</h4><p id='1'>संजय उवाच पुत्रस्तु ते महाराज रथस्थो रथिनां वरः। दुरुत्सहो बभौ युद्धे यथा रुद्रः प्रतापवान्॥<br />Sanjaya said Filled with the courage of despair, that best of car-warriors, O king viz., your son, looked resplendent on his car in that battle like Rudra himself.</p>
<p id='2'>तस्य बाणसहस्रैस्तु प्रच्छन्ना ह्यभवन्मही। परांश्च सिषिचे बाणैर्धाराभिरिव पर्वतान्॥<br />With the thousands of arrows shot by him, the Earth was completely covered. He drenched his enemies with showers of arrows like the clouds pouring rain on mountain breasts.</p>
<p id='3'>न च सोऽति पुमान् कश्चित् पाण्डवानां बलार्णवे। यो गजो रथो वापि यः स्याद् बाणैरविक्षतः॥<br />There was then not a man amongst the Pandavas in that great battle or a horse or an elephant or a car, who or which was not struck with Duryodhana's arrows.</p>
<p id='4'>यं यं हि समरे योधं प्रपश्यामि विशाम्पते। स स बाणैश्चितोऽभूद्वै पुत्रेण तव भारत॥<br />O king, amongst the warriors every one, O Bharata, was struck by your son with his arrows.</p>
<p id='5'>यथा सैन्येन रजसा समुद्भूतेन वाहिनी। प्रत्यदृश्यत संछन्ना तथा बाणैर्महात्मनः॥<br />The Pandava army was then covered with the arrows of that great warriors even as a army is covered with the dust it raises while marching for battle.</p>
<p id='6'>बाणभूतामपश्याम पृथिवीं पृथिवीपते। दुर्योधनेन प्रकृतां क्षिप्रहस्तेन धन्विना॥<br />The Earth then, O king, was as if converted into one sheet of arrows by your son Duryodhana, that bowman endued with great lightness of hand.</p>
<p id='7'>तेषु योधसहस्रेषु तावकेषु परेषु च। एको दुर्योधनो ह्यासीत् पुमानिति मतिर्मम॥<br />Amongst those thousands of warriors on the field, of your side or that of the enemy, it appeared as if Duryodhana was then the only man.</p>
<p id='8'>तत्राद्भुतमपश्याम तव पुत्रस्य विक्रमम्। यदेकं सहिताः पार्था नाभ्यवर्तन्त भारत।॥<br />The prowess displayed by your son was highly wonderful, since the Parthas, even in a body, could not approach him who was single.</p>
<p id='9'>युधिष्ठिरं शतेनाजी विव्याध भरतर्षभ। भीमसेनं च सप्तत्या सहदेवं च पञ्चभिः॥<br />He struck Yudhishthira, O best of Bharata's race, with a hundred arrows and Bhimasena with seventy and Sahadeva with seven.</p>
<p id='10'>नकुलं त चतुःषष्ट्या धृष्टद्युम्नं च पञ्चभिः। सप्तभिद्रौपदेयांश्च त्रिभिर्विव्याध सात्यकिम्॥ धनुश्चिच्छेद भल्लेन सहदेवस्य मारिष।<br />And he struck Nakula with sixty four and Dhrishtadyumna with five and the sons of Draupadi with seven and Satyaki with three arrows. With a broad-headed arrow, he then, O king, cut off the bow of Sahadeva.</p>
<p id='11'>तदपास्य धनुश्छिन्नं माद्रीपुत्रः प्रतापवान्॥ अभ्यद्रवत राजानं प्रगृह्यान्यन्महद् धनुः। ततो दुर्योधनं संख्ये विव्याध दशभिः शरैः॥<br />Casting off that broken bow, the heroic son of Madri, took up another formidable bow and rushing against the king, viz., Duryodhana struck him with ten arrows in that battle.</p>
<p id='12'>नकुलस्तु ततो वीरो राजानं नवभिः शरै। घोररूपैर्महेष्वासो विव्याध च ननाद च॥<br />The great and brave bowman Nakula then struck the king with nine terrible arrows and uttered a loud war cry.</p>
<p id='13'>सात्यकिश्चैव राजानं शरेणानतपर्वणा। द्रौपदेयास्त्रिसप्तत्या धर्मराजश्च पञ्चभिः॥ अशीत्या भीमसेनश्च शरै राजानमार्पयन्।<br />Satyaki struck the king with a single straight shaft; the sons of Draupadi struck him with seventy three and king Yudhishthira struck him with five. And Bhimasena assailed the king with eighty arrows.</p>
<p id='14'>समन्तात् कीर्यमाणस्तु बाणसंधैर्महात्मभिः॥ न चचाल महाराज सर्वसैन्यस्य पश्यतः।<br />Though struck thus from all sides with numerous arrows by those illustrious warriors, Duryodhana still, O king, did not waver, in the presence of all the soldiers assembled there.</p>
<p id='15'>लाघवं सौष्ठवं चापि वीर्यं चापि पहात्मनः॥ अति सर्वाणि भूतानि ददृशुः सर्वमानवाः।<br />The quickness, the skill and the prowess of that illustrious warrior excelled those of every man.</p>
<p id='16'>धार्तराष्ट्रा हि राजेन्द्र योधास्तु स्वल्पमन्तरम्॥ अपश्यमाना राजानं पर्यवर्तन्त दंशिताः।<br />Meanwhile the Dhartarashtras, O king, who had not fled far away, beholding the king, rallied and returned there, clad in mail.</p>
<p id='17'>तेषामापततां घोरस्तुमुलः समपद्यत॥ क्षुब्धस्य हि समुद्रस्य प्रावृट्काले यथा स्वनः।<br />The noise made by them when they returned was exceedingly awful, like the roar of the surging deep during the rainy season.</p>
<p id='18'>समासाद्य रणे ते तु राजानमपराजितम्॥ प्रत्युद्ययुर्महेष्वासाः पाण्डवानाततायिनः।<br />Approaching their invincible king in that battle, those great bowmen rushed against the Pandavas for fight.</p>
<p id='19'>भीमसेनं रणे क्रुद्धो द्रोणपुत्रो न्यवारयत्॥<br />The son of Drona opposed in that battle the angry Bhimasena.</p>
<p id='20'>नानाबाणैर्महाराज प्रमुक्तैः सर्वतोदिशम्। नाज्ञायन्त रणे वीरा न दिशः प्रदिशः कुतः॥<br />With the arrows, O king, that were shot in that battle, all the points of the horizon were completely covered, so that the brave warriors could not distinguish the cardinal from the subsidiary points of the compass.</p>
<p id='21'>तावुभौ क्रूरकर्माणावुभौ भारत दुःसहौ। घोररूपमयुध्येतां कृतप्रतिकृतैषिणौ॥ त्रासयन्तौ दिशः सर्वा ज्याक्षेपकठिनत्वचौ।<br />As regards Ashvatthaman and Bhimasena, O Bharata, both of them performed wonderful feats. Both of them were invincible in battle. The arms of both continued marks of bowstring for having repeatedly drawn the same. Opposing each other, they fought on, frightening the entire universe.</p>
<p id='22'>शकुनिस्तु रणे वीरो युधिष्ठिरमपीडयत्॥ तस्याश्वांश्चतुरो हत्वा सुबलस्य सुतो विभो। नादं चकार बलवत् सर्वसैन्यानि कोपयन्॥<br />The heroic Shakuni struck Yudhishthira in that battle. Having killed the four horses of the king the powerful son of Subala uttered a loud roar, making all the soldiers tremble with fear.</p>

<p id='24'>अथान्यं रथमास्थाय धर्मपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरः। शकुनि नरभिर्विद्ध्वा पुनर्विव्याध पञ्चभिः॥ ननाद च महानादं प्रवरः सर्वधन्विनाम्।<br />Then riding on another car, returned king Yudhishthira and having pierced Shakuni at first with nine arrows, once more struck him with five. And that best of all bowmen then sent up a loud roar.</p>
<p id='25'>तद् युद्धमभवचित्रं घोररूपं च मारिष॥ प्रेक्षतां प्रीतिजननं सिद्धचारणसेवितम्।<br />That battle presented a wonderful spectacle, It filled the spectators with delight and was praised by the Siddhas and the Charanas.</p>

<p id='34'>तस्य तैरभवद् युद्धमिन्द्रियैरिव देहिनः॥ घोररूपमसंवार्य निर्मर्यादमवर्तत।<br />The encounter that took place between him and those five resembled that which takes place between a man and his five senses. It was awful and fierce and no party showed any consideration for the other.</p>
<p id='35'>ते च सम्पीडयामासुरिन्द्रियाणीव बालिशम्॥ स च तान् प्रति संरब्धः प्रत्ययोधयदाहवे।<br />The five sons of Draupadi assailed Kripa like the senses afflicting a foolish man. He, on the other hand, fighting with thein, opposed them vigorously.</p>
<p id='36'>एवं चित्रमभूद् युद्धं तस्य तैः सह भारत॥ उत्थायोत्थाय हि यथा देहिनामिन्द्रयैर्विभो।<br />That battle between him and them was indeed wonderful because it resembled the struggles, O king, between men and their Senses.</p>

<p id='44'>उपाशाम्यत् ततस्तीवं तद् रजो घोरदर्शनम्। ततोऽपश्यमहं भूयो द्वन्द्वयुद्धानि भारत॥ यथाप्राणं यथाश्रेष्ठं मध्याह्ने वै सुदारुणे। वर्मणां तत्र राजेन्द्र व्यदृश्यन्तोज्ज्वला: प्रभाः॥<br />When that dense and awful cloud of dust was put down there were seen many single encounters, O Bharata, that the heroes fought at the noon each according to his strength and his rank. They were all exceedingly fierce. The sheen of the weapons in those encounters, O king, appeared full in view.</p>
