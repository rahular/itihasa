<h3>KARNA PARVA: Chapter 77</h3><h4>The defeat of Shakuni</h4><p id='1'>संजय उवाच श्रुत्वा तु रथनिर्घोषं सिंहनादं च संयुगे। अर्जुनः प्राह गोविन्दं शीघ्र नोदय वाजिनः॥<br />Sanjaya said Hearing the loud rattles of chariots and the lion like roars (of warriors) in the field, Arjuna, addressing Govinda, said, “Clap spurs to the chargers."</p>
<p id='2'>अर्जुनस्य वचः श्रुत्वा गोविन्दोऽर्जुनमब्रवीत्। एष गच्छामि सुक्षिप्रं यत्र भीमो व्यवस्थितः॥<br />Hearing these words of Arjuna, Govinda replied him (thus)-"Off I go towards the spot where Bhima has taken his post.”</p>
<p id='3'>तं यान्तमश्चैर्हिमशङ्खवणैः सुवर्णमुक्तामणिजालनद्धैः। जम्भं जिघासुं प्रगृहीतवज्रं जयाय देवेन्द्रमिवोगमन्युम्॥<br />Then, like the king of the celestials, proceeding in great wrath and with thunder in his arms, to strike down Jambha (the Asura), Jaya (Arjuna) rushed (in the field), to obtain victory, borne by horses white as snow or conchs and with housings laid with gold, pearls and gems.</p>
<p id='4'>रथाश्वमातङ्गपदातिसंघा बाणस्वनैमिखुरस्वनैश्च। संनादयन्तो वसुधां दिशश्च क्रुद्धा नृसिंहा जयमभ्युदीयुः॥<br />Many warriors, (of the other side), representing lions in prowess all boiling with rage and followed by a large retinue him and making the Earth resound and rending the skies with the whizz of their arrows, the rattling sound of the wheels of their war-chariots and the noise of the tread of their horses' hoofs.</p>
<p id='5'>तेषां च पार्थस्य च मारिषसीद् देहासुपापक्षपणं सुयुद्धम्। त्रैलोक्यहेतोरसुरैर्यथाऽऽसीद् देवस्य विष्णोर्जयतां वरस्य॥<br />Then, there ensued, O sire, a mortal conflict between them (the train-bands of the Kaurava forces) and Partha, a conflict carrying death and destruction in its train to body, life and sin alike, like the great battle between the Asuras and Vishnu, the greatest of all great conquerors, for the (sovereignty of the) three worlds.</p>
<p id='6'>देकः प्रचिच्छेद किरीटमाली। क्षुरार्धचन्द्रैर्निशितैश्च भल्लैः शिरांसि तेषां बहुधा च बाहून्॥<br />Alone and unaided, the diadem-decked and garland-necked Arjuna, rent asunder all the powerful weapons flung (against him) by them (his adversaries) and struck off their heads and arms in many and varied forms, with his razoredged and crescent shaped shafts, as also with his broad-pointed arrows.</p>
<p id='7'>नश्वान् रथान् पत्तिगणान् द्विपांश्च। ते पेतुरुवा॒ बहुधा विरूपा वातप्रणुन्नानि यथा वनानि॥<br />Umbrellas, banners, horses, chariots, elephants and foot soldiers, shattered and mutilated, fell down on the Earth, like a forest uprooted by a violent wind.</p>
<p id='8'>सुवर्णजालावतता महागजाः सवैजयन्तीध्वजयोधकल्पिताः। श्चकाशिरे प्रज्वलिता यथाचलाः॥<br />Mighty elephants caparisoned with goldlaid trappings and equipped with banners of triumphs and adorned with riders (on their back), wore a majestic look and shed a lustur all round as they were encompassed with goldwinged shafts, like blazing mountains.</p>
<p id='9'>विदार्थं नागाश्वरथान् धनंजयः शरोत्तमैर्वासववज्रसंनिभैः। द्रुतं ययौ कर्णजिघांसया तथा यथा मरुत्वान् बलभेदने पुरा॥<br />With excellent shafts piercing elephants, horses and war chariots and resembling thunder of Vasava, Dhananjaya winged his way to strike down Karna, like Indra, in days of yore, proceeding to rend in twain (the Asura) Bala.</p>
<p id='10'>ततः स पुरुषव्याघ्रस्तव सैन्यमरिंदमः। प्रविवेश महाबाहुर्मकरः सागरं यथा॥<br />Then that mightiest of men, the terror of enemies, rushed headlong into the midst of your vast array as does the Makar while plunging into the deep sea.</p>
<p id='11'>तं हृष्टास्तावका राजन् स्थपत्तिसमन्विताः। गजाश्वसादिबहुलाः पाण्डवं समुपाद्रवन्॥<br />Seeing Pandu's sun so advance, O king, your warriors, with a long line of cars and a retinue of elephant, horse and foot soldiers, pressed upon him.</p>
<p id='12'>तेषामापततां पार्थमारावः सुमहानभूत्। सागरस्येव क्षुब्धस्य यथा स्यात् सलिलस्वनः॥<br />And while rushing against Partha, they raised a tumultuous cry like the roarings of the surging waves in a tempest.</p>
<p id='13'>ते तु तं पुरुषव्याघ्रं व्याघ्रा इव महारथाः। अभ्यद्रवन्त संग्रामे त्यक्त्वा प्राणकृतं भयम्॥<br />Those great warriors, powerful like tigers, reckless of their life, rushed in battle to face that mighty man, careering like a tiger.</p>
<p id='14'>तेषामापततां तत्र शरवर्षाणि मुञ्चताम्। अर्जुनो व्यधमत् सैन्यं महावातो घनामिव॥<br />With a heavy down-pour of arrows they advanced towards him, but Arjuna dispersed them like vapours before the gushing wind.</p>
<p id='15'>तेऽर्जुन सहिता भूत्वा रथवंशैः प्रहारिणः। अभियाय महेष्वासा विव्यधुर्निशतैः शरैः॥<br />Those mighty warriors-all good shots and of unfailing aim-in a body and with a long line of war-chariots following them, advanced against Arjuna and began to pierce him with their sharp weapons.</p>
<p id='16'>ततोऽर्जुनः सहस्राणि रथावारणवाजिनाम्। प्रेषयामास विशिखैर्यमस्य सदनं प्रति॥<br />Arjuna, then, (rendering asunder) with his arrows, chariots, elephants and horses by thousands, dispatched (them) off to the region of Pluto.</p>
<p id='17'>ते वध्यमाना समरे पार्थचापच्युतैः शरैः। तत्र यत्र स्म लीयन्ते भये जाते महारथाः॥<br />Thus afflicted in action with shots flung from Arjuna's bow, those mighty car-warriors, terrified and panic-stricken, began gradually to melt away.</p>
<p id='18'>तेषां चतुःशतान् वीरान् यतमानान् महारथान्। अर्जुनो निशितेर्बाणैरनयद् यमसादनम्॥<br />Among those great car-warriors four hundred valiantly kept the field; and Arjuna, with his keen shafts, sent them, one and all, to their last account.</p>
<p id='19'>ते वध्यमानाः समरे नानालिङ्गै शितैः शरैः। अर्जुनं समभित्यज्य दुद्रुवुर्वे दिशो दश॥<br />(And those that held the rear) afflicted, in that battle, with keen shafts and sharp arrows of all kinds, dispersed themselves in all directions-far away from Arjuna.</p>
<p id='20'>तेषां शब्दो महानासीद् द्रवतां वाहिनीमुखे। महौघस्येव जलधेर्गिरिमासाद्य दीर्यतः॥<br />The shouting noise made at the van by the retreating army was as furious as the grumbling roars of the breakers of the surging seas when dashing against rocks.</p>
<p id='21'>तां तु सेनां भृशं विद्ध्वा द्रावयित्वार्जुनः शरैः। प्रायादभिमुखः पार्थः सूतानीकं हि मारिष॥<br />Thus, with his arrows, dispersing the panicstricken army, O sire, Arjuna, the son of Pritha, advanced against the column commanded by the son of Suta.</p>
<p id='22'>तस्य शब्दो महानासीत् परानभिमुखस्य वै। गरुडस्येव पततः पन्नगार्थे यथा पुर॥<br />The great noise made by Arjuna while advancing towards his enemies, was like that of Garuda, in days of yore, while swooping down upon snakes.</p>
<p id='23'>तं तु शब्दमभिश्रुत्य भीमसेनो महाबलः। भभूव परमप्रीतः पार्थदर्शनलालसः॥<br />The mighty Bhimasena, anxious as he was to have a look of Partha, became highly gratified with that sound.</p>
<p id='24'>श्रुत्वैव पार्थमायान्तं भीमसेनः प्रतापवान्। त्यक्त्वा प्राणान् महाराज सेनां तव ममर्द ह॥<br />Hearing that Partha is come, the redoubtable Bhimasena, O king, began to afflict your troops, fearless of his own life.</p>
<p id='25'>स वायुवीर्यप्रतिमो वायुवेगसमो जवे। वायुवद् व्यचरद् भीमो वायुपुत्रः प्रतापवान्॥<br />Bhima, the son of the Wind-god and himself possessing the prowess and impetuousity of the wind, that valiant Bhima began to career in that battle like that of the wind itself.</p>
<p id='26'>तेनार्धमाना राजेन्द्र सेना तव विशाम्पते। व्यभ्रश्यत महाराज भिन्ना नौरिव सागरे॥<br />Your army, O king, being thus hard pressed by him, O ruler of the universe, began to roll and tumble like a shattered vessel in the high seas.</p>
<p id='27'>तां तु सेनां तदा भीमो दर्शयन् पाणिलाघवम्। शरैरवचकतॊग्रैः प्रेषयिष्यन् यमक्षयम्॥<br />Bhima then, with his deadly weapons and with great dexterity of hands, waging a ruthless slaughter amongst that body of troops, dispatched them to the region of Pluto.</p>
<p id='28'>तत्र भारत भीमस्य बलं दृष्ट्वाऽतिमानुषम्। व्यभ्रमन्त रणे योधाः कालस्येव युगक्षये॥<br />Your warriors, O Bharata, seeing the wonderful exploits of Bhima in that battle, careering like the King of Terrors at the end of time, became greatly agitated.</p>
<p id='29'>तथादितान् भीमबलान् भीमसेनेन भारत। दृष्ट्वा दुर्योधनो राजा इदं वचनमब्रवीत्॥ सैनिकांश्च महेष्वासान् योधांश्च भरतर्षभ। समादिशन् रणे सर्वान् हत भीममिति स्म ह॥<br />King Duryodhana, seeing his best soldiers, O Bharata, thus worsted by Bhimasena, gave vent to the following expression, addressing his whole hosts, generals and other great warriors, O best of the Bharata race, "All of you in a body engaged Bhima in action and fell him down (inasmuch as on him hinges the fate of the Pandavas).</p>
<p id='30'>तस्मिन् हते हतं मन्ये पाण्डुसैन्यमशेषतः। प्रतिगृह्य च तामाज्ञां तव पुत्रहस्य पार्थिवाः॥ भीमं प्रच्छादयामासुः शरवर्षेः समन्ततः।<br />When he (Bhimasena) is felled, well may I count upon the Pandu forces as if already slain. Following the behest of your son, all the vassal chiefs (hitting) from all sides, covered Bhima with a thick shower of arrows.</p>
<p id='31'>गजाश्च बहुला राजन् नराश्च जयगृद्धिनः॥ रथे स्थिताश्च राजेन्द्र परिवब्रुर्वृकोदरम्।<br />Hosts of elephants, O monarch and men, eager for victory, as also war-chariots and horses, O King of Kings, thickened around Vrikodara.</p>
<p id='32'>स तैः परिवृतः शरैः राजन् समन्ततः॥ शुशुभे भरतश्रेष्ठो नक्षत्रैरिव चन्द्रमाः।<br />That chef of the Bharata race, endued with heroic qualities, being thus hemmed in by those brave bands of heroes, looked resplendent like the radiant Moon shedding its effulgence amidst myriads of glowing stars.</p>
<p id='33'>परिवेषी यथा सोमः परिपूर्णो विराजते॥ स रराज तथा संख्ये दर्शनीयो नरोत्तमः। निर्विशेषो महाराज यथा हि विजयस्तथा।॥<br />O monarch, that foremost of men, was looking, during that fight, so beautiful, like the full Moon in the midst of his corona. He look like Arjuna. There is no difference between him and Arjuna.</p>
<p id='34'>तस्य ते पार्थिवाः सर्वे शरवृष्टिं समासृजन्। क्रोधरक्तेक्षणाः शूरा हन्तुकामा वृकोदरम्॥<br />All those kings with eyes flamed with wrath and bent upon slaying Vrikodara, began to shower down their weapons upon him.</p>
<p id='35'>तां विदार्य महासेनां शरैः संनतपर्वभिः। निश्चकाम रणाद् भीमो मत्स्यो जालादिवाम्भसि॥३७<br />As the fish frees itself from the net, so did Bhima cutting their shafts straight free himself from the pressure of the battle.</p>
<p id='36'>हत्वा दशसहस्राणि गजानामनिवर्तिनाम्। नृणां शतसहस्रे द्वे द्वे शते चैव भारत॥ पञ्च चाश्वसहस्राणि रथानां शतमेव च। हत्वा प्रास्यन्दयद् भीमो नदी शोणितवाहिनीम्॥<br />O Bharata slaying ten thousand elephants that faced him, two lakhs two hundred men, hundred car-warriors and five thousand horses Bhima actually made a river of blood to flow there.</p>
<p id='37'>शोणितोदां रथावर्ता हस्तिग्राहसमाकुलाम्। नरमीनाश्वनक्रान्तां केशशैबलशाद्वलाम्॥ संछिन्नभुजनागेन्द्रां बहुरत्नापहारिणीम्। ऊस्याहां मजपङ्का शीर्षोपलसमावृताम्॥ धनुष्काशां शरावापां गदापरिधकेतनाम्। हंसच्छत्रध्वजोपेतामुष्णीषवरफेनिलाम्॥ हारपद्माकरां चैव भूमिरेणूर्मिमालिनीम्। आर्यवृत्तवतां संख्ये सुतरां भीरुदुस्तराम्॥ योधग्राहवतीं संख्ये वहन्तीं यमसादनम्। क्षणेन पुरुषव्याघ्रः प्रावर्तयत निम्नगाम्॥ यथा वैतरणीमुग्रां दुस्तरामकृतात्मभिः। तथा दुस्तरणी घोरां भीरूणां भयवर्धिनीम्॥<br />In that carnage blood flowed like water and the war-cars forming its eddies, elephants, its alligators, horses and men, its sharks and fishes and the hair of animals, its herbs and moss, were all floating on it. Arms severed from bodies floated like snakes and precious stones were abundant in the bloody current; thighs and marrows formed its gavials and mud and human heads, its mountain. Iron bound bludgeous and maces were also floating there like snakes, and bows and arrows formed its rafts by means of which persons tried to cross that fearful and bloody stream, banners and umbrellas drifted on it like swans and costly head-dresses its foam. The dust rising from the earth were like the waves of the stream and jeweled necklaces were looking like so many lotuses; the brave could alone cross that stream while the faint hearted sunk within to navigate it. That gushing current, with hands of sturdy soldiers forming its alligators and crocodiles, streamed its course towards the realm of Death. (and) and that man with tiger-like ferocity made its course flew on. (And) as the Vaitarani is unnavigable by persons of fifth and inequity, even so was that awful stream of blood to men wanting in valour and intrepidity, making their heart quail with shudder.</p>
<p id='38'>यतो यतः पाण्डवेयः प्रविष्टो रथसत्तमः। ततस्ततोऽघातयत योधाशतसहस्रशः॥<br />(And) there that son of Pandu, the best of car-warriors, rushed in, slaying hundred thousands of enemy.</p>
<p id='39'>एवं दृष्ट्वा कृतं कर्म भीमसेनेन संयुगे। दुर्योधन महाराज शकुनि वाक्यमब्रवीत्॥<br />Duryodhana seeing Bhimasena thus career in battle, ( king said unto Shakuni the following words-</p>
<p id='40'>जहि मातुलं संग्रामे भीमसेनं महाबलम्। अस्मिञ्जिते जितं मन्ये पाण्डवेयं महाबलम्॥<br />Overpower in the battle, O uncle, the allpowerful Bhimasena. The victory over the vast array of the Pandava forces hinges on his final overthrow.</p>
<p id='41'>ततः प्रायान्महाराज सौबलेयः प्रतापवान्। रणाय महते युक्तो भ्रातृभिः परिवारितः॥ स समासाद्य संग्रामे भीमं भीमपराक्रमम्। वारयामास तं वीरो वेलेव मकरालयम्॥<br />Being thus desired, O king, the powerful son of Subala, the peer of great warriors marshaled in array, marched on-his brothers surrounding him. That hero, affronting the fiercely powerful Bhima in that battle, checked his intrepidity, as if a continent resisting the tides of an ocean.</p>
<p id='42'>संन्यवर्तत तं भीमो वार्यमाण: शितैः शरैः। शकुनिस्तस्य राजेन्द्र वामपार्श्वे स्तनान्तरे॥ प्रेषयामास नाराचान् रुक्मपुङ्खाशिलाशितान्।<br />And despite he resistance of the keen shafts, (which the powerful son of Subala hurled against him,) Bhima approached him (in formidable array). Whereupon Shakuni, O king of kings, flung a number of cloth-yard shafts, bedecked with wings of gold and sharpened on stone and assailed Bhima at the seat of his heart.</p>
<p id='43'>वर्म भित्वा तु ते घोराः पाण्डवस्य महात्मनः॥ न्यमञ्जन्त महाराज कङ्कबर्हिणवाससः।<br />Those fearful shafts, feathered with the plumes of Kankas and peacocks, O monarch, piercing the coat of mail of the high-souled son of Pandu, sunk deep into his vital parts.</p>
<p id='44'>सोऽतिविद्धो रणे भीमः शरं रुक्मविभूषितम्॥ प्रेषयामास स रुषा सौबलं प्रति भारत।<br />Being thus smitten in battle, O Bharata, Bhima, then flung, all of a sudden, a shaft laid with gold upon the son of Subala.</p>
<p id='45'>तमायान्तं शरं घोरं शकुनिः शत्रुतापनः॥ चिच्छेद सप्तधा राजन् कृतहस्तो महाबलः।<br />And the powerful Shakuni, the inflictor of woes on his enemies and O king, skillful in the manipulation of hands, rent that fearful weapon in seven fragments as it was coursing its way towards him.</p>
<p id='46'>तस्मिन् निपतिते भूमौ भीमः क्रुद्धो विशामप्ते॥ धनुश्चिच्छेद भल्लेन सौबलस्य हसन्निव।<br />His weapon thus falling adrift on the ground, O king, Bhima, inflamed with rage, without any strain rent in twain with a broadpointed arrow the bow of the son of Subala.</p>
<p id='47'>तदपास्य धनुश्छिन्नं सौबलेयः प्रतापवान्॥ अन्यदादाय वेगेन धनुर्भल्लांश्च षोडश।<br />Whereupon the mighty son of Subala, throwing away that bow, rendered useless, with the greatest alacrity seized a new one, as also sixteen broad-edged shafts.</p>
<p id='48'>तैस्तस्य तु महाराज भल्लैः संनतपर्वभिः॥ द्वाभ्यां स सारथिं ह्या द् भीमं सप्तभिरेव च। ध्वजमेकेन चिच्छेद द्वाभ्यां छत्रं विशाम्पते॥ चतुर्भिश्चतुरो वाहान् विव्याध सुबलात्मजः।<br />And the son of Subala, O king, hit the chariot-driver with two and Bhima with seven; struck off the banner with one and the umbrella with two; and pierced, O lord of the universe, the four chargers with the remaining four chargers with the remaining four of those broad-headed shafts.</p>
<p id='49'>ततः क्रुद्धो महाराज भीमसेनः प्रतापवान्॥ शक्तिं चिक्षेप समरे रुक्मदण्डामयस्मयीम्।<br />Enraged at this, O king, the powerful Bhima, in that battle, threw down a weapon made of iron and the staff of which was decked with gold.</p>
<p id='50'>सा भीमभुजनिर्मुक्ता नागजिह्वेव चञ्चला॥ निपपात रणे तूर्णं सौबलस्य महात्मनः।<br />That weapon, resembling in activity the tongue of a snake, being thus cast from the arms of Bhima came speedily down upon the chariot of the noble son of Subala.</p>
<p id='51'>ततस्तामेव संगृह्य शक्तिं कनकभूषणाम्॥ भीमसेनाय चिक्षेप क्रुद्धरूपो विशाम्पते।<br />(And) he (the son of Subala) seized that weapon, adorned with gold and O lord of the universe, hurled it back against Bhimasena with a fierce countenance,</p>
<p id='52'>सा निर्भिद्य भुजं सव्यं पाण्डवस्य महात्मनः॥ निपपात तदा भूमौ यथा विद्युन्नभश्च्युता।<br />That weapon, piercing through the left arm of the noble son of Pandu, fell down like flashes of lightning coursing on the ground.</p>
<p id='53'>अथोत्क्रुष्टं महाराज धार्तराष्ट्रः समन्ततः॥ न तु तं ममृषे भीमः सिंहनादं तरस्विनाम्।<br />Then the Dhartarashtras began to rent the air from all sides with their loud out-crics, but, O king, Bhima could not brook the lion-like roars of the enemy, all of great intrepidity.</p>
<p id='54'>अन्यद् गृह्य धनुः सज्यं त्वरमाणो महाबलः॥ मुहूर्तादिव राजेन्द्र च्छादयामास सायकैः। सौबलस्य बलं संख्ये त्यक्त्वाऽऽत्मानं महाबलः॥६५<br />That extraordinarily powerful man (Bhima) taking hold of another bow fitted with string, almost in no time, O best of kings, covered the mighty son of Subala and his forces, who were fighting valiantly without caring the least for their lives, with showers of arrows.</p>
<p id='55'>तस्याश्वांश्चतुरो हत्वा सूतं चैव विशाम्पते। ध्वजं चिच्छेद भल्लेन त्वरमाणः पराक्रमी॥<br />That mighty man (Bhimasena) with utmost intrepidity stricking off his (Shakuni's) four horses and then sending his charioteer to his eternal rest, O ruler of the universe, rent asunder his adversary's banner with a broadedged arrow.</p>
<p id='56'>हताश्वं रथमुत्सृज्य त्वरमाणो नरोत्तमः। तस्थौ विस्फारयंश्चापं क्रोधरक्तेक्षणः श्वसन्॥<br />Speedily bounding out of that steedless chariot, Shakuni, the best of men, with eyes flaming with wrath and stretched bow, took his stand on the ground, breathing all the while heavy breaths.</p>
<p id='57'>शरैश्च बहुधा राजन् भीममार्च्छत् समन्ततः। प्रतिहत्य तु वेगेन भीमसेनः प्रतापवान्॥ धनुश्चिच्छेद संक्रुद्धो विव्याध च शतैः शरैः।<br />And then, O king, he covered Bhima with numberless arrows from all sides. Then the mighty Bhima rending asunder Shakuni's arrows with great wrath hit him with a host of sharp arrows.</p>
<p id='58'>सोऽतिविद्धो बलवता शत्रुणा शत्रुकर्शनः॥ निपपात तदा भूमौ किंचित्प्राणो नराधिपः।<br />Being thus afflicted by his powerful assailant, that destroyer of enemies, O king, dropped down on the Earth almost dead.</p>
<p id='59'>ततस्तं विह्वलं ज्ञात्वा पुत्रस्तव विशाम्पते॥ अपोवाह रथेनाजी भीमसेनस्य पश्यतः।<br />Seeing him (Shakuni) in such a woeful plight, your son, O supreme ruler of the universe, putting him in his own chariot carried him off from the scene of action before the very face of Bhimasena.</p>
<p id='60'>रथस्थे तु नरव्याने धार्तराष्ट्राः पराङ्मुखाः॥ प्रदुद्रुवुर्दिशो भीता भीमाजाते महाभये।<br />Seeing that foremost of men, Shakuni, thus knocked down and borne away on Duryodhana's chariot, the Imperial hosts began to beat a hasty retreat from the field and flew in all directions from the very fear of Bhimasena.</p>
<p id='61'>सौबले निर्जिते राजन् भीमसेनेन धन्विना॥ भयेन महताऽऽविष्टः पुत्रो दुर्योधनस्तव। अपायाजवनैरश्वैः सापेक्षो मातुलं प्रति॥<br />When the son of Subala was thus discomfited and defeated, O monarch, by that excellent archer (Bhimasena) your son Duryodhana, left the field in a state of trepidation and out of his concern for the life of his uncle Shakuni, urged his fiery chargers to a furious speed.</p>
<p id='62'>पराङ्मुखं तु राजानं दृष्ट्वा सैन्यानि भारत। विप्रजग्मुः समुत्सृज्य द्वैरथानि समन्ततः॥<br />Seeing the king thus flee away from the battle, all his troops, O foremost of the line of Bharata, who were each engaged in fierce struggle with a hand-to-hand fight, began to disperse themselves in all directions.</p>
<p id='63'>तान् दृष्ट्वा विद्रुतान् सर्वान् धार्तराष्ट्रान् पराङ्मुखान्। जवेनाभ्यापतद् भीमः किरशरशतान् बहून्॥<br />Observing the whole hosts of the Dhritarasthra force thus dispersing themselves in every direction, Bhima, with great impetuosity rushed against them and attacked them with innumerable arrows.</p>
<p id='64'>ते वध्यमाना भीमेन धार्तराष्ट्राः पराङ्मुखाः। कर्णमासाद्य समरे स्थिता राजन् समन्ततः॥<br />Thus afflicted by Bhima, O monarch, the retreating bands of Dhritarashtra's army (all in a body moved towards Karna's flank).</p>
<p id='65'>स हि तेषां महावीर्यो द्वीपोऽभूत सुमहाबलः। भिन्ननौका यथा राजन् द्वीपमासाद्य निर्वृताः॥ भवन्ति पुरुषव्याघ्र नाविकाः कालपर्यये। तथा कर्णं समासाद्य तावकाः पुरुषर्षभ॥ समाश्वस्ता: स्थिता राजन् सम्प्रहृष्टाः परस्परम्। समाजग्मुश्च युद्धाय मृत्यु कृत्वा निवर्तनम्॥<br />And coming thither and with them (General Karna) in their centre, they once more held there ground. As the ship-wrecked mariners become comforted in reaching in island, so your distressed army stood cheerfully on finding that mighty Karna. O foremost of the Bharata race, O inightiest of men, O lord of the universe, they then proceeded having death for their ultimate end.</p>
