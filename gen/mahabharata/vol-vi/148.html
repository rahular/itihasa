<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच ऋषिरासीन्महावीर्यः कुणिर्गो महायशाः। स तप्त्वा विपुलं राजस्तपो वै तपतां वरः॥ मनसाऽथ सुतां सुभुं समुत्पादितवान् विभुः। तां च दृष्ट्वा मुनिः प्रीतः कुणिर्गों महायशाः॥<br />Vaishampayana said "There a highly illustrious and energetic Rishi, named Kuni-Garga. Having practised the austerest of penances, O king, that best of ascetics, created a fair browed daughter by his desire. Secing her, the celebrated ascetic Kuni-Garga was filled with joy. He renounced his body, O king and then went to heaven.</p>

Though her father had been for giving her away in marriage, yet she did not wish for it, for she was no husband worthy of her.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>ततः सा तपसोगेण पीडयित्वाऽऽत्मनस्तनुम्॥ पितृदेवार्चनरता बभूव विजने वने।<br />Emaciating her body with austere penances, she began to worship the Pitris and the gods in that solitary forest.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>साऽऽत्मानं मन्यमानापि कृतकृत्यं श्रमान्विता॥<br />Although engaged in such a hard task, O king and although she cmaciated herself by age and austeritics, yet she thought herself happy.</p>
