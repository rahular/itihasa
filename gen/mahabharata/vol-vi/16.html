<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>पार्थः संशप्तकबलं प्रविश्यार्णवसंनिभम्। व्यक्षोभयदमित्रधो महावात इवार्णवम्॥<br />The son of Pritha, that slayer of enemies, having entered into the army of the Samsaptakas, that was like the great ocean, afflicted it most highly; even as the dreadful tempest agitates the vast ocean.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>शिरांस्युन्मथ्य वीराणां शितैर्भल्लैर्धनंजयः। पूर्णचन्द्राभवक्त्राणि स्वक्षिभूदशनानि च ॥ संतस्तार क्षितिं क्षिप्रं विनालैनलिनैरिव।<br />Dhananjaya, after having severed the heads of the heroic warriors by broad-headed and sharp-edged arrows, that (viz. the heads) had faces, as resplendent as the full moon and also very handsome eyes, eye-brows and teeth, immediately scattered the earth over with these heads, as if with lotuses severed from their stalks.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>सुवृत्तानायतान् पुष्टांश्चंदनागुरुभूषितान्॥ सायुधान् सतलत्रांश्च पञ्चचास्योरगसंनिभान्। बाहून् क्षुरैरमित्राणां चिच्छेद समरेऽर्जुनः॥<br />Arjuna cut-off the arms of his antagonists with keen arrows, that were like the razors, which, viz. the arms were excellently round, long and muscular and also were rubbed over with soft sandal and other perfumes and again, were furnished with weapons and fingers protected with leathern cases and resembled the five-headed snakes, in that dreadful battle.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>धुर्यान् धुर्यगतान् सूतान ध्वजाश्चापानि सायकान्। पाणीन् सरत्नानसकृद भल्लैश्चिच्छेद पाण्डवः॥<br />The son of Pandu, again and again, cut-off with his broad-faced arrows the horses and horsemen, the drivers of cars and standards, bows and arrows, as well as arms, that were ornamented with valuable jewels.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>रथान् द्विपान् हयांश्चैव सारोहानर्जुनो युधि। शरैरनेकसाहौनिन्ये राजन् यमक्षयम्॥<br />O monarch, in that battle Arjuna, sent away innumerable car-warriors, elephants, horses and cavalry to the abode of Death, by striking them with several thousands of arrows.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>तं प्रवीराः सुसंरब्धा नर्दमाना इवर्षभाः। वासितार्थमिव क्रुद्धमभिद्रुत्य मदोत्कटाः॥ निघ्नन्तमभिजनुस्ते शरैः शृङ्गैरिवर्षभाः।<br />The foremost of heroes, who became very wrathful and who roared most loudly and who, again, like bulls, were highly excited as if for a cow in season, proceeded most rapidly against him (Arjuna) with great uproars. Then those warriors began to strike him (Arjuna) with their shafts who at that time continued to slay his (Arjuna's) antagonist, even as the bulls strike another of their kind with the horns.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>तस्य तेषां च तद् युद्धमभवल्लोमहर्षणम्॥ त्रैलोक्यविजये यद्वद् दैत्यानां सह वज्रिणा।<br />Thus the battle, which caused the hairs to stand on points, waged between him (Arjuna) and them (other warriors); even as there had taken place a battle of the Daityas with the wielder of the thunder-bolt (Indra) at the conquest of the three worlds.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>अस्त्रैरस्त्राणि संवार्य द्विषतां सर्वतोऽर्जुनः॥ इषुभिर्बहुभिस्तूर्णं विद्ध्वा प्राणाञ्जहार सः।<br />That Arjuna, after having restrained the weapons of his antagonists, coming from all sides, by the weapons of his own and also having pierced the foes with a large number of shafts most rapidly, had taken away their lives.</p>

The celestial kettle-drums also begun to be sounded; and showers of flowers continued to fall upon the heads of both Keshava and Arjuna. Meanwhile a voice,</p>

Those two are as invincible as Brahman and Ishana. They are seated on the same car. They are the best of all creatures. They are most heroic. And the both are equal to Nara and Narayana.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>इत्येतन्महदाश्चर्य दृष्ट्वा श्रुत्वा च भारत॥ अश्वत्थामा सुसंयत्तः कृष्णावभ्यद्रवद् रणे।<br />Thus hearing and beholding this wonderful event, O descendant of the Bharata race, Ashvatthaman, firmly resolved upon, rushed towards the two Krishnas, viz. Arjuna and Keshava, in that battle.</p>

O Madhava, do you order me really what should be performed first. If you consider it proper, that the work of hospitality should be given Ashvatthama first after rising.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>एवमुक्तोऽवहत् पार्थं कृष्णो द्रोणात्मजान्तिके। जैत्रेण विधिनाऽऽहूतं वायुरिन्द्रमिवाध्वरे॥<br />Having been thus addressed (by Arjuna), Krishna carried, to the near presence of the son of Drona, the son of Pritha, who was invited to battle according to the prescribed maxims of triumphant challenge; even as the God of wind carries Indra to the sacrificial place.</p>

<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>निर्वेष्टुं भर्तृपिण्डं हि कालोऽयमुपजीविनाम्। सूक्ष्मो विवादो विप्राणां स्थूलौ क्षात्रौ जयाजयौ॥२८<br />This, indeed, is the fit occasion for those, who support their lives with the food of their masters, to repay obligation to their supporters. The struggle between the Brahmanas is most insignificant; but the war between two Kshatriyas is a grand and decisive one, resulting either in victory or defeat.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>यामभ्यर्थयसे मोहाद् दिव्यां पार्थस्य सक्रियाम्। तामाप्नुमिच्छन युध्यस्व स्थिरो भूत्वाद्य पाण्डवम्।। २९<br />You, who are most willing to receive, out of foolishness, those celestial rites of hospitality at the hands of the son of Pritha, after having becalmed yourself this day, continue to fight with the son of Pandu.</p>

The son of Drona, on the other hand, took up another bow, more dreadful than the first.</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>सज्यं कृत्वा निमेषाच विव्याधार्जुनकेशवो। त्रिभिः शतैर्वासुदेवं सहस्रेण च पाण्डवम्॥<br />Having stretched his bow within so short a time as the twinkling of the eye, he (the son of . Drona) pierced both Arjuna and Keshava-Vashudeva with three hundred shafts and the son of Pandu with one thousand arrows.</p>

<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>तस्य तं निनदं श्रुत्वा पाण्डवोऽच्युतमब्रवीत्। पश्य माधव दौरात्म्यं गुरुपुत्रस्य मां प्रति॥<br />Having heard this great uproar of him (the son of Drona), the son of Pandu, addressed that Eternal One, saying-O Madhava, observe this great oppression of the son of the preceptor towards me.</p>

Moreover Dhananjaya slew both the horsemen and the infantry, welladorned with the ornaments.</p>
<p id='39'><a href='#39'></a>धनंजययुगान्तकः संशप्तकमहार्णवम्। व्यशोषयत दुःशोषं तीक्ष्णैः शरगभस्तिभिः॥<br />Dhananjaya, like the sun appearing at the end of the Yuga, had soaked away the vast deep of the Samsaptaka army, that was most difficult to be dried up, by means of his sharpheaded arrows, that constituted his rays.</p>
