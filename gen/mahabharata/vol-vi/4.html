<h3>KARNA PARVA: Chapter 4</h3><h4>The bewailing of Dhritarashtra</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच एतच्छ्रुत्वा महाराज धृतराष्ट्रोऽम्बिकासुतः। शोकस्यान्तमपश्यन् वै हतं मेने सुयोधनम्॥ विह्वलः पतितो भूमौ नष्टचेता इव द्विपः।<br />Vaishampayana said Having heard this (the above intelligence), the great king Dhritarashtra, the son of Ambika, experienced, indeed, the farthest limit of grief and considered Suyodhana slain (in the battle); and highly perturbed, he fell down upon the ground, like an elephant, that had lost all his senses.</p>
<p id='2'>तस्मिन् निपतिते भूमौ विह्वले राजसत्तमे॥ आर्तनादो महानासीत् स्त्रीणां भरतसत्तम।<br />O the most excellent of the Bharata race, on the fall of the highly agitated and foremost of monarchs upon the ground, there was tremendous wailing of women.</p>
<p id='3'>स शब्दः पृथिवी कृत्स्नां पूरयामास सर्वशः॥ शोकार्णवे महाघोरे निमग्ना भरतस्त्रियः। रुरुदुर्दुःखशोकार्ता भृशमुद्विग्नचेतसः॥<br />Which (the noise) filled the entire earth to all its points. The ladies of the house hold of Bharata, greatly burnt in grief and with hearts filled with great anxiety, bewailed most bitterly, plunged as they were in the very deep ocean of sorrow.</p>
<p id='4'>राजानं च समासाद्य गान्धारी भरतर्षभ। निःसंज्ञा पतिता भूमौ सर्वाण्यन्तः पुराणि च ॥<br />O best of the Bharata race advancing towards the king, Gandhari, as well as all other ladies of the royal household, fell down upon the ground, all having lost their senses. a</p>

<p id='6'>समाश्वस्ताः स्त्रियस्तास्तु वेपमाना मुहुर्मुहुः। कदल्य इव वातेन धूयमानाः समन्ततः॥<br />In spite of their being comforted (by Sanjaya), those ladies shivered every moment like the plantain tree constantly shaken by the wind.</p>
<p id='7'>राजानं विदुस्थापि प्रज्ञाचक्षुषमीश्वरम्। आश्वासयामास तदा सिञ्चस्तोयेन कौरवम्॥<br />Thereupon Vidura, too, began to sprinkle water over the face of that descendant of Kuru and consoled that powerful monarch, who had eyes of wisdom.</p>
<p id='8'>स लब्वा शनकैःसंज्ञां ताश्च दृष्टा स्त्रियो नृप। उन्मत्त इव राजेन्द्र स्थितस्तूष्णीं विशाम्पते॥<br />O Lord of carth, having gradually attained to consciousness and understanding the rniserable plight of those ladies, the monarch, like at senseless being, remained silent for sometime.</p>
<p id='9'>ततो ध्यात्वा चिरं कालं निःश्वस्य च पुनः पुनः। स्वान् पुत्रान् गर्हयामास बहु मेने त्व पाण्डवान्॥<br />Thereupon he, reflecting (upon the matter) for a pretty long time and sighing heavily and incessantly, condemned his own sons but spoke highly of the Pandavas.</p>
<p id='10'>गर्हयंश्चात्मनो बुद्धिं शकुनेः सौबलस्य च। ध्यात्वा तु सुचिरं कालं वेपमानो मुहुर्मुहुः॥<br />Then having condemned his own reason as well as that of Shakuni the son of Subala and meditated (upon the matter) for a long while, the king trembled at every moment.</p>
<p id='11'>संस्तभ्य च मनो भूयो राजा धैर्यसमन्वितः। पुनर्गावल्गर्णि सूतं पर्यपृच्छत संजयम्॥<br />The king had, again, restrained his mind and collected enough of patience. Then he asked his charioteer Sanjaya, the son of</p>
<p id='12'>यत् त्वया कथितं वाक्यं श्रुतं संजय तन्मया। कच्चिद् दुर्योधनः सूत न गतो वै यमक्षयम्॥ जये निराशः पुत्रो मे सततं जयकामुकः। ब्रूहि संजय तत्त्वेन पुनरुक्तां कथामिमाम्॥<br />O Sanjaya, whatever words were uttered by you were all heard by me. O charioteer, has not my son Duryodhana gone to the region of Yama? Has my son, who is ever desirous of victory, grown desperate of success? O Sanjaya, do you repeat to me in detail truly what you have said already.</p>
<p id='13'>एवमुक्तोऽब्रवीत् सूतो राजानं जनमेजय। हतो वैकर्तनो राजन् सह पुत्रैर्महारथः॥ भ्रातृभिश्च महेष्वासैः सूतपुत्रैस्तनुत्यजैः।<br />O Janamejaya, having been thus asked, the Suta addressed the king, saying-"O king, the son of Vikartan., that mighty car-warrior, was killed in battle along with his sons and brothers, as well as the other warrior sons of Suta, who were all great bowmen and who also were ready to give up their lives in battle.</p>
