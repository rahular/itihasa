<h3>KARNA PARVA: Chapter 88</h3><h4>The words of Ashvatthama</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>संजय उवाच र्गन्धर्वरक्षाऽप्सरसां च सर्वः। ब्रह्मर्षिराजर्षिसुपर्णजुष्टं बभौ वियद् विस्मयनीयरूपम्॥<br />Sanjaya said It was really a wonderful sight to see the skies covered with Gods, Nagas, Asuras, Yakshas and numbers of Gandharvas, Rakshashas, Apsaras, Royal and regenerate Rishis and birds of most beautiful plumage.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>दिवदगीतस्तुनृत्यहासैः। सर्वेऽन्तरिक्षं ददृशुर्मनुष्याः स्वस्थाश्च तद् विस्मयनीयरूपम्॥<br />All the human beings looked and admired the scene in the sky which was filled with the echoes of sons, music, laughter, sacred hymns, dance and many other sorts of beautiful sounds.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>ततः प्रहृष्टाः कुरुपाण्डुयोधा वादित्रशङ्खस्वनसिंहनादैः। विनादयन्तो वसुधां दिशश्च स्वनेन सर्वान द्विषतौ निजघ्नुः॥<br />Then the warriors on both the Kaurava and Pandava sides went on slaying each other's enemies making the world and the ten sides ring with martial music, notes of their conchs, loud houts and noise of their warfare.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>नराश्वमातङ्गरथैः समाकुलं शरासिशक्तृष्टिनिपातदुःसहम्। अभीरुजुष्टं हतदेहसंकुलं रणाजिरं लोहितमाबभौ तदा॥<br />The field of battle became brilliantly red with blood and adorned with men, horses, elephants, cars and weapons and became difficult for the throwing of swords, maces, darts and other weapons and was filled with dead bodies.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>बभूव युद्धं कुरूपाण्डवानां यथा सुराणामसुरैः सहाभवत्। तथा प्रवृत्ते तुमुले सुदारुणे धनंजयस्याधिरथेश्च सायकैः॥ दिशश्च सैन्यं च शितैरजिह्मगैः परस्परं प्रावृणुतां सुदंशितौ।<br />Looked like the fight that in the old days took place between the Gods and the Asuras. When Dhananjaya and Adhiratha's son had begun to defeat the warriors with their arrows, they, with keen shafts, almost covered all the sides.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>ततस्त्वदीयाश्च परे च सायकैः कृतेऽन्धकारे ददृशुर्न किंचन॥ स्ततोऽभवत् त्वद्भुतमेव सर्वतः।<br />Darkness fell over the atmosphere, with the shafts shot at in that battle and the warriors on either side could not see anything. And being afraid they took shelter of either of the carwarriors (Karna or Arjuna) like streaks of light going towards the sun or the moon.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>ततोऽस्त्रमस्त्रेण परस्परं तौ विधूय वाताविव पूर्वपश्चिमौ॥ घनान्धकारे वितते तमोनुदौ यथोदितौ तद्वदतीव रेजतुः।<br />The two brave warriors thwarted one another's weapons, like the East and West winds struggling with each other and looked brilliant like the sun or the moon after dispelling darkness.</p>

<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>महाधनुर्मण्डलमध्यगावुभौ सुवर्चसौ बाणसहस्रदीधिती॥ युगान्तसूर्याविव दुःसहौ रणे।<br />Both of them were armed with fearful bows drawn to the fullest extent like circles which looked like coronas, shot thousands of shafts which were like rays. In war they could not be borne and looked like two powerful suns risen for destroying the universe at the end of Yuga.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>बुभौ जिघांसु कृतिनौ परस्परम्॥ महेन्द्रजम्भाविव कर्णपाण्डवौ।<br />Both unconquerable, both destroyers of enemies and they were bent upon killing one another and showing great skill in war. Those two fighters namely Karna and the son of Pandu bravely assailed each other in that awful fight like Indra and Asura Jamba;</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>ततो महास्त्राणि महाधनुर्धरौ विमुञ्चमानाविषुभिर्भयानकैः॥ नराश्वनागानमितान् निजघ्नतुः परस्परं चापि महारथी नृप।<br />O monarch, invoking the help of most powerful weapons those two redoubtable bowmen shot fearful arrows against each other.

<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>ततस्तु दुर्योधनभोजसौबलाः कृपेण शारद्वतसूनुना सह॥ महारथाः पञ्च धनंजयाच्युतौ शरैः शरीरार्तिकरैरताडयन्।<br />Then the five great car warriors viz. Duryodhana, the king of Bhojas, Subala's son Kripa and the son of Sharadvata attacked Dhananjaya and Keshava with deadly arrows.</p>

Then one hundred chariots, one hundred elephants and Shaka, Tushara and Yavana cavalry together with some best of Kamboja warriors precipitated themselves upon Arjuna in order to slay him but he (Arjuna) very soon not only cut-off with razor-headed shafts all those weapons of his enemies but also their heads, their elephants, cars and horses. Dhananjaya locked down his enemies in battle.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>ततोऽन्तरिक्षे सुरतूर्यनिःस्वनाः ससाधुवादा हृषितैः समीरिताः॥ निपेतुरप्युमपुष्पवृष्टयः सुगन्धिगन्धाः पवनेरिताः शुभाः।<br />Then the good Gods sounded their heavenly drums in praise of Arjuna. Then heaps of sweet scented flowers fell upon Arjuna.</p>

Vrikodara and the twins (Nakul and Sahadeva) are always under Yudhishthira's order; and if you make peace it would appear that you make it only for the welfare of all parties. All the kings then will return to their respective homes and the troops will no longer fight with each other; if you do not hear my advice you will have to repent hereafter when you will be crushed by your enemies.</p>
