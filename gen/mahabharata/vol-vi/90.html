<p id='59'>निहन्तुमार्यः पुरुषव्रते स्थितः। दुवाच किं पाण्डव हे प्रमाद्यसे॥<br />The honorable Arjuna, always following the duties of a hero, did not like to kill him in that plight. Then Indra's younger brother respectfully said "why do you make a mistake, OPandu's son?</p>
<p id='60'>नैवाहितानां सततं विपश्चितः क्षणं प्रतीक्षन्त्यपि दुर्बलीयसाम्। विशेषतोऽरीन् व्यसनेषु पण्डितो निहत्य धर्म च यशश्च विन्दते॥<br />The wise never spare their enemies even for a moment, however weak they may be.
