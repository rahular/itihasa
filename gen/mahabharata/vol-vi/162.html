Censure and bad name, which soever this act may engender, ought to be incurred by a person who leads the life of a Kshatriya. The sinful Pandavas have, at every step, perpetrated very ugly, censurable and deceitful acts.</p>

<p id='54'>वादित्रघोषस्तुमुलो विमिश्रः शङ्खनिःस्वनैः। अनिलेनेरितो घोरो दिशः पूरयतीव ह॥<br />The loud sound of their instruments, mingled with the blare of conchs, is fearful to the ear, and carried by the winds, is filling all the points of the horizon.</p>
<p id='55'>अश्वानां हेषमाणानां गजानां चैव बुंहताम्। सिंहनादश्च शूराणां श्रूयते सुमहानयम्॥<br />Loud also is the neighing of their steeds and the grunting of their elephants and the roaring of their warriors.</p>

<p id='57'>पाण्डवैर्धार्तराष्ट्राणां यदिदं कदनं कृतम्। वयमेव त्रयः शिष्टा अस्मिन् महति वैशसे॥<br />So great has been the havoc made by the Pandavas on the Dhartarashtras that we three are the only survivors.</p>
<p id='58'>केचिन्नागशतप्राणाः केचित् सर्वास्त्रकोविदाः। निहताः पाण्डवेयैस्ते मन्ये कालस्य पर्ययम्॥<br />Some were gifted with the strength of a hundred elephants and some were masters of all weapons. Yet they have been killed by the son of Pandu. I consider this to be an instance of the reverses caused by Destiny.</p>
<p id='59'>एवमेतेन भाव्यं हि नूनं कार्वेण तत्त्वतः। यथा ह्यस्येदृशी निष्ठा कृतकार्येऽपि दुष्करे॥<br />Truly, this is the end of which such acts leads. Although the Pandavas have achieved such difficult feats, yet this should be the result of those feats.</p>
<p id='60'>भवेतास्तु यदि प्रज्ञा न मोहादपनीयते। व्यापन्नेऽस्मिन् महत्यर्थे यन्नः श्रेयस्तदुच्यताम्॥<br />If you have not lost your wisdom out of stupefaction, then say what is proper for us to do under these circumstances.</p>
