<h3>Gadayuddha Parva: Chapter 62</h3><h4>Yudhishthira praises Krishna</h4><p id='1'>संजय उवाच ततस्ते प्रययुः सर्वे निवासाय महीक्षितः। शङ्खान् प्रध्मापयन्तो वै हृष्टाः परिघबाहवः॥<br />Sanjaya said "All those kings, having arms resembling spiked bludgeons, then went towards their tents, overflowing with joy and blowing their conchs on their way.</p>
<p id='2'>पाण्डवान् गच्छतश्चापि शिबिरं नो विशाम्पते। महेष्वासोऽन्वगात् पश्चाद् युयुत्सुः सात्यकिस्तथा॥ धृष्टद्युम्न: शिखण्डी च द्रौपदेयाश्च सर्वशः। सर्वे चान्ये महेष्वासाः प्रययुः शिबिराण्युत॥<br />The Pandavas also, O king, proceeded towards our tents. The great bowmen Yuyutsu followed them, as also Satyaki, and Dhrishtadyumna, and Shikhandin, and the five sons of Draupadi. The other great bowmen also went towards our tents.</p>
<p id='3'>ततस्ते प्राविशन् पार्था हतत्विट्कं हतेश्वरम्। दुर्योधनस्य शिबिरं रङ्गवद्विसृते जने॥<br />The Parthas then entered the tent of Duryodhana, shorn of its splendours and bereft of its master, and looking like a pleasureground deserted by spectators.</p>
<p id='4'>गतोत्सवं पुरमिव हृतनागमिव ह्रदम्। स्त्रीवर्षवरभूयिष्ठं वृद्धामात्यैरधिष्ठितम्॥<br />That pavilion looked like a city void of festivities, or a lake without its elephant. It was filled with women and eunuchs and aged counsellors.</p>
<p id='5'>तत्रैतान् पर्युपातिष्ठन् दुर्योधनपुरःसराः। कृताञ्जलिपुटा राजन् काषायमलिनाम्बराः।॥<br />Duryodhana and other heroes, dressed in yellow raiment's, formerly used, O king, to wait reverentially, with joined hands, on those old counsellors.</p>
<p id='6'>शिबिरं समनुप्राप्य कुरुराजस्य पाण्डवाः। अवरुर्महाराज रथेभ्यो रथसत्तमाः॥<br />Arriving at the pavilion of the Kuru king, the Pandavas, those foremost of car-warriors, O king, got down from their cars.</p>
<p id='7'>ततो गाण्डीवधन्वानमभ्यभाषत केशवः। स्थितः प्रियहिते नित्यमतीव भरतर्षभ।॥ अवरोपय गाण्डीवमक्षयौ च महेषुधी। अथाहमवरोक्ष्यामि पश्चाद् भरतसत्तम।॥<br />Ever engaged, in the good of his friend, Keshava, addressed the holder of Gandiva, saying, "Take down your Gandiva as also the two inexhaustible quivers. I shall get down after you, O best of the Bharatas.</p>
<p id='8'>स्वयं चैवावरोह त्वमेतच्छ्रेयस्तवानघ। तचाकरोत् तथा वीरः पाण्डुपुत्रो धनंजयः॥<br />Get down, for this is for your own good, O sinless one!'-Pandu's brave son, Dhananjaya, did as he was directed.</p>
<p id='9'>अथ पश्चात् ततः कृष्णो रश्मीनुत्सृज्य वाजिनाम्। अवारोहत मेधावी रथाद् गाण्डीवधन्वनः॥<br />Leaving the reins of the horses the intelligent Krishna then got down from the car of Dhananjaya.</p>
<p id='10'>अथातवतीर्णे भूतानामीश्वरे सुमहात्मनि। कपिरन्तर्दधे दिव्यो ध्वजो गाण्डीवधन्वनः॥<br />After the great Lord of all creatures had got down from that car, the celestials Ape that was on the standard of Arjuna's car disappeared there and then.</p>
<p id='11'>स दग्धो द्रोणकर्णाभ्यां दिव्यैरस्त्रैर्महारथः। अथादीप्तोऽग्निना ह्याशु प्रजज्वाल महीपते॥<br />That great car then, which had before been burnt by Drona and Karna with their celestial weapons, quickly caught fire, O king, without any thing being seen there.</p>
<p id='12'>सोपासङ्गः सरश्मिश्च साश्वः सयुगबन्धुरः। भस्मीभूतोऽपतद् भूमौ रथो गाण्डीवधन्वनः॥<br />Indeed, the car of Dhananjaya, with its quivers, reins, horses, yoke, and shaft, fell down, all reduced to ashes.</p>
<p id='13'>तं तथा भस्मभूतं तु दृष्ट्वा पाण्डुसुताः प्रभो। अभवन् विस्मिता राजन्नर्जुनश्चेदमब्रवीत्॥ कृताञ्जलिः सप्रणयं प्रणिपत्याभिवाद्य ह। गोविन्द कस्माद् भगवन् रथोदग्धोऽयमग्निना॥<br />Seeing the vehicle thus reduced to ashes, O Iord, the sons of Pandu filled with wonder, and Arjuna, O king, having saluted Krishna and bowed un.o him, said these words, with joined hands, 'O Govinda, O divine one, why has this car been consumed by fire?</p>
<p id='14'>किमेतन्महदाश्चर्यमभवद् यदुनन्दन। तन्मे ब्रूहि महाबाहो श्रोतव्यं यदि मन्यसे॥<br />Whiat is this highly wonderful incident that has taken place before our eyes? O you of mighty arms, if you think that I can hear it without injury then tell me everything.'</p>
<p id='15'>वासुदेव उवाच अस्त्रैर्बहुविधैर्दग्धः पूर्वमेवायमर्जुन। मदधिष्ठित्तत्वात् समरे न विशीर्णः परंतप॥<br />Vasudeva said That car, O Arjuna, had already been consumed by various sorts of weapons. It was because I had sat upon it during battle that it did not break into pieces, O destroyer of foes.</p>
<p id='16'>इदानीं तु विशीर्णोऽयं दग्धो ब्रह्मास्त्रतेजा। भया विमुक्तः कौन्तेय त्वय्यद्य कृतकर्मणि।॥<br />Previously consumed by the power of Brahma weapons, it has been reduced to ashes upon my leaving it after you had achieved your object.</p>
<p id='17'>ईपदुत्स्मयमास्तु भगवान् केशवोऽरिहा। परिष्वज्य च राजानं युधिष्ठिरमभाषत॥ दिष्ट्या जयसि कौन्तेय दिष्ट्याते शत्रवो जिताः। दिष्टया गाण्डीवधन्वा च भीमसेनश्च पाण्डवः॥ त्वं चापि कुशली राजन् माद्रीपुत्रो च पाण्डवौ। मुक्ता वीरक्षयादस्मात् संग्रामानिहतद्विषः॥ क्षिप्रमुक्तरकालानि कुरु कार्याणि भारत। उपायतमुपप्लव्यं सह गाण्डीवधन्वना॥<br />Then, with a little pride, Lord Keshava embracing king Yudhishthira, said to him, 'By good luck, you have gained the victory, O son of Kunti! By good luck, your enemies have been defcated! By good luck, the holder of Gandiva and Bhimasena the son of Pandu, and yourself, O king, and the two sons of Madri have escaped alive from this battle so destructive of heroes, after having killed all your foes! Speedily do, O Bharata, what should now be done!</p>
<p id='18'>आनीय मधुपर्कं मां यत् पुरा त्वमवोचथाः। एष भ्राता सखा चैव तव कृष्ण धनंजयः॥ रक्षितव्यो महाबाहो सर्वास्वापत्स्विति प्रभो। तव चैव ब्रुवाणस्य तथेत्येवाहमब्रुवम्॥ स सव्यसाची गुप्तस्ते विजयी च जनेश्वर।<br />After I had arrived at Upaplavya, you the holder of Gandiva, gave me honey and the customary ingredients, and said, O Lord, This Dhananjaya, O Krishna, is your brother and SO friend! He should, therefore, be protected by you in all dangers!-To your these words I answered saying-So be it!-That Savyasachin has always been protected by me. You have also gained victory, O king.</p>
<p id='19'>भ्रातृभिः सह राजेन्द्र शूरः सत्यपराक्रमः॥ मुक्तो वीरक्षयादस्मात् संग्रामाल्लोमहर्षणात्। एवमुक्तस्तु कृष्णेन धर्मराजो युधिष्ठिरः॥ हृष्टरोमा महाराज प्रत्युवाच जनार्दनम्।<br />With his brothers, O king of kings, that truly powerful hero, has come out alive of this dreadful battle, destructive of heroes.'-Thus addressed by Krishna, king Yudhishthira with his hairs standing erect, O king, said to Janarddana.</p>
<p id='20'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच प्रमुक्तं द्रोणकर्णाभ्यां ब्रह्मास्त्रमरिमर्दन॥ कस्त्वदन्यः सहेत् साक्षादपि वज्री पुरंदरः।<br />Yudhishthira said Who else, except you. O destroyer of foes, not even thunder-holding Purandara himself, could have withstood the Brahma weapons discharged by Drona and Karna!</p>
<p id='21'>भवतस्तु प्रसादेन संशप्तकगणा जिताः॥ महारणगतः पार्थो यच नासीत् पराङ्मुखः।<br />It was through your favour that the Samsaptakas were vanquished! It was through your favour that Partha had never to turn back from even the fiercest of battles!</p>
<p id='22'>तथैव च महाबाहो पर्यायैर्बहुभिर्मया॥ कर्मणामनुसंतानं तेजसश्च गती: शुभाः। उपप्लव्ये महषिर्मे कृष्णद्वैपायनोऽब्रवीत्॥ यतो धर्मस्ततः कृष्णो यतः कृष्णस्ततो जयः।<br />It was through your favour O mighty-armed one, that I myself, with my descendants, have, by performing various feats, obtained the auspicious end of prowess and energy! At Upaplavya, the Rishi Krishna-Dvaipayana told me that where there is Krishna righteousness and victory will be there."</p>
<p id='23'>इत्येवमुक्ते ते वीराः शिबिरं तव भारत॥ प्रविश्य प्रत्यपद्यन्त कोशरत्नर्धिसंचयान्। रजतं जातरूपं च मणीनथ च मौक्तिकान्॥ भूषणान्यथ मुख्यानि कम्बलान्यजिनानि च। दासीदासमसंख्येयं राज्योपकरणानि च॥ प्राप्य धनमक्षय्यं त्वदीयं भरतर्षभ। उदक्रोशन्महाभागा नरेन्द्र विजितारयः॥<br />Sanjaya continued After this conversation, those heroes entered your son's encampment, and secured the weapons of chest, many jewels, and much wealth, and silver and gold and gems and pearls and many rich ornaments and blankets and skins, and innumerable slaves male and female, and many other things required by kings. Having secured that inexhaustible wealth belonging to you, O foremost of Bharata's race, those highly-blessed ones, whose enemies had been killed, uttered loud cries of joy.</p>
<p id='24'>ते तु वीराः समाश्वस्य वाहनान्यवमुच्य च। अतिष्ठन्त मुहुः सर्वे पाण्डवाः सात्यकिस्तथा।॥<br />Having unyoked their animals, the Pandavas and Satyaki took rest there awhile.</p>
<p id='25'>अथाब्रवीन्महाराज वासुदेवो महायशाः। अस्माभिर्मङ्गलार्थाय वस्तव्यं शिबिराद् बहिः॥ तथेत्युक्त्वा हि ते सर्वे पाण्डवाः सात्यकिस्तथा। वासुदेवेन सहिता मङ्गलार्थं बहिर्ययुः॥<br />Then the illustrious Vasudeva said. We should, as the first sacred act, remain out of the camp for this night. Saying 'So be it!'—the Pandavas and Satyaki, accompanied by Vasudeva, went put of the camp for doing this auspicious act.</p>
<p id='26'>ते समासाद्य सरितं पुण्यामोघवतीं नृप। न्यवसन्नथ तां रात्रि पाण्डवा हतशत्रवः॥<br />Arrived on the banks of the sacred stream Oghavati, O king, the Pandavas, who had no enemies took up their quarters there for that night.</p>
<p id='27'>युधिष्ठिरस्ततो राजा प्राप्तकालमचिन्तयत्। तत्र ते गमनं प्राप्तं रोचते तव माधव॥ गान्धार्याः क्रोधदीप्तायाः प्रशमार्थमरिंदम। हेतुकारणयुक्तैश्च वाक्यैः कालसमीरितैः॥ क्षिप्रमेव महाभाग गान्धारी प्रशमिष्यसि। पितामहश्च भगवान् व्यासस्तत्र भविष्यति॥<br />King Yudhishthira then brought to his mind, the outright action with the time and said O enemy suppressor Madhava! It appears all good to visit at Hastinapura in order to pacify Gandhari who is burning with anger. O noble lord! You will only able to pacify Gandhari by referring to reasonable and time matching things to her. Our grand-father Vyasa will also present there.</p>
<p id='28'>वैशम्पायन उवाच ततः सम्प्रेषयामासुर्यादवं नागसाह्वयम्। स च प्रायाजवेनाशुः वासुदेवः प्रतापवान्॥ दारुकं रथमारोप्य येन राजाम्बिकासुतः।<br />They then sent Keshava to Hastinapura. The highly powerful Vasudeva causing Daruka to get upon his car, proceeded very quickly to that place where the royal son of Ambika was.</p>
<p id='29'>तमूचुः सम्प्रयास्यन्तं शैव्यसुग्रीववाहनम्॥ प्रत्याश्वासय गान्धारी हतपुत्रां यशस्विनीम्। स प्रायात् पाण्डवैरुक्तस्तत् पुरं सात्वतां वरः॥ आससाद ततः क्षिप्रं गान्धारीं निहतात्मजाम्॥<br />While about to start on his car, having Shaivya and Sugriva yoked to it, (the Pandavas) said to him—Comfort the helpless Gandhari who has lost all her sons.'-Thus addressed by the Pandavas, the chief of the Satvatas then set out for Hastinapura and arrived before Gandhari who had all her sons slain.”</p>
