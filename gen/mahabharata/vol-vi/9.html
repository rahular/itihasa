<h3>KARNA PARVA: Chapter 9</h3><h4>The repentance of Dhritarashtra</h4><p id='1'>संजय उवाच श्रिया कुलेन यशसा तपसा च श्रुतेन च। त्वामद्य सन्तो मन्यन्ते ययातिमिव नाहुषम्॥<br />Sanjaya said The sages consider you to be equal to Yayati, the son of Nahusha, in beauty, in lineage, in celebrity, in austerity and in the knowledge about the Shastras.</p>
<p id='2'>श्रुते महर्षिप्रतिमः कृतकृत्योऽसि पार्थिव। पर्यवस्थापयात्मानं मा विषादे मनः कृथा॥<br />O monarch, you are equal to a great sage in learning; and you are highly successful in respect of all actions. So be you concentrated in self and let not your heart be plunged in sorrow.</p>
<p id='3'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच दैवमेव परं मन्ये धिक् पौरुषमनर्थकम्। यत्र शालप्रतीकाशः कर्णोऽहन्यत संयुगे॥<br />Dhritarashtra said I consider Destiny to be superior and human effort to be fruitless; for the reason that Karna, who was like a Sala tree, was slain in battle.</p>
<p id='4'>हत्वा युधिष्ठिरानीकं पञ्चालानां रथव्रजान्। प्रताप्य शरवर्षेण दिश: सर्वा महारथः॥<br />Having slain the entire force of Yudhishthira as well as the car-warriors of the Panchala race and having afflicted, by the showers of arrows, the men in the different directions of the horizon.</p>
<p id='5'>मोहयित्वा रणे पार्थान् वज्रहस्त इवासुरान्। स कथं निहतः शेते वायुरुग्ण इव द्रुमः॥<br />And also having rendered the Parthas senseless in battle, even as Indra with the thunderbolt in his hand, stupifying the Asuras, how has that great car-warrior (Karna) been slain in battle, who now lies dead (in the field) like a large tree up-rotted by the wind.</p>
<p id='6'>शोकस्यान्तं न पश्यामि पारं जलनिधेरिव। चिन्ता मे वर्धतेऽतीव मुमूर्षा चापि जायते॥<br />I do not find the end of my so 'w like that of the overflowed ocean. My anxieties are growing more acute; and the desire for death has been growing in me.</p>
<p id='7'>कर्णस्य निधनं श्रुत्वा विजयं फाल्गुनस्य च। अश्रद्धेयमहं मन्ये वधं कर्णस्य संजय॥<br />Having heard of the intelligence of the slaughter of Karna and the victory of Falguna. To me, O Sanjaya, the death of Karna, seems to be incredible.</p>
<p id='8'>वज्रसारमयं नूनं हृदयं दुर्भिदं मम। यच्छ्रुत्वा पुरुषव्याघ्रं हतं कर्णं न दीर्यते॥<br />Really, my heart is pretty well hard and seems to be made up of the essence of the thunder-bolt, because it does not split up into thousand pieces on my hearing of the death of Karna.</p>
<p id='9'>आयुनूनं सुदीर्घं मे विहित दैवतैः पुरा। यत्र कर्णं हतं श्रुत्वा जीवामीह सुदुःखितः॥<br />Indeed, my life was ordained before (my birth) to be pretty long by Destiny; since, when having heard of the slaughter of Karna, I am still alive, although I am highly afflicted with grief.</p>
<p id='10'>घिग्जीवितमिदं चैव सुहृद्धीनश्च संजय। अद्य चाहं दशोमेतां गतः संजय गर्हिताम्॥<br />O Sanjaya, let there be shame to this my life, who am deprived of friends. Rebuked to iny life, I have been reduced today to this hateful condition.</p>
<p id='11'>कृपणं वर्तयिष्यामि शोच्यः सर्वस्य मन्दधीः। अहमेव पुरा भूत्वा सर्वलोकस्य सत्कृतः॥ परिभूतः कथं सूत परैः शक्ष्यामि जीवितुम्।<br />Foolish as I am and subject to universal pity, I shall (hereafter) have to lead a miserable life. O Suta, having at first been highly esteemed by all people, how shall I, being vanquished by the enemies, be able to hold my life?</p>
<p id='12'>दुःखात् सुदुःखव्यसनं प्राप्तवानस्मि संजय॥ भीष्मद्रोणवधैनैव कर्णस्य च महात्मनः।<br />O Sanjaya, on the death of Bhishma, Drona and the lofty-minded Karna, I have attained to the greatest sorrow and calamity.</p>
<p id='13'>नावशेष प्रपश्यामि सूतपुत्रे हते युधि॥ स हि पारो महानासीत् पुत्राणां मम संजय।<br />When the son of Suta was slain in battle, I do not see the end (viz. that any one on my side will escape the slaughter); since he, indeed, O Sanjaya, was the best means of crossing over (this ocean of hostilities) to my sons.</p>
<p id='14'>युद्धे हि निहतः शूरो विसृजन् सायकान् बहून्॥ को हि मे जीवितेनार्थस्तमृते पुरुषर्षभम्।<br />While that hero was showering forth innumerable arrows, he was slain in battle. Without that foremost of persons what necessity have I for my life."</p>
<p id='15'>रथादाधिरथिनं न्यपतत् सायकार्दितः॥ पर्वतस्येव शिखरं वज्रपाताद् विदारितम्।<br />Having been highly afflicted with the showers of arrows, the son of Adhiratha, indeed, fell down from his car, like the summit of a mountain, split up by the fall of the thunder-bolt.</p>
<p id='16'>स शेते पृथिवीं नूनं शोभयन् रुधिरोक्षितः॥ मातङ्ग इव मत्तेन द्विपेन्द्रेण निपातितः<br />Surely having adorned the earth, he, besmeared with blood, sleeps in the ground, like an elephant killed by an infuriate lord of elephants.</p>
<p id='17'>यो बलं धार्तराष्ट्राणां पाण्डवानां यतो भयम्॥ सोऽर्जुनेन हतः कर्णः प्रतिमानं धनुष्मताम्।<br />That Karna who had been the strength of all the Dhartarashtras and who had been the object of terror to the Pandavas and who, again, had been the type of the best of all bowmen, was slain by Arjuna.</p>
<p id='18'>स हि वीरो महेष्वासो मित्राणामभयंकरः॥ शेते विनिहतो वीरो देवेन्द्रेण इवाचलः।<br />That heroic and mighty bowman, conferred fearlessness on my sons; and that warlike one, being in battle, lies on the ground like a mountain pierced by the lord of the celestials.</p>
<p id='19'>पङ्गोरिवाध्वगमनं दरिद्रस्येव कामितम्॥ दुर्योधनस्य चाकूतं तृषितस्येव विपुषः।<br />The realisation of the end of Duryodhana is even like the walking of the lame and like the fulfillment of the desires of the poor and also like straying out of the water drops from the mouth of the thirsty.</p>
<p id='20'>अन्यथा चिन्तितं कार्यमन्यथा तत् तु जायते॥ अहो नु बलवद् दैवं कालश्च दुरतिक्रमः।<br />Actions considered in one way turn out differently. Alas, Destiny is really powerful and Time is insuperable?</p>
<p id='21'>पलायमानः कृपणे दीनात्मा दीनपौरुषः॥ कचिद् विनिहतः सूत पुत्रो दुःशासनो मम। कचिन्न दीनाचरितं कृतवांस्तात संयुगे॥ कचिन्न निहतः शूरो यथाऽन्ये क्षत्रियर्षभाः।<br />O Suta, how was my son Dushasana slain, while that one of low spirit, that wretched one of little prowess, was flying away from the battle? O son, O Suta, has he not acted in a cowardly manner? Was not that hero slain, even as the other Kshatriyas were slain?</p>
<p id='22'>युधिष्ठिरस्य वचनं मा युध्यस्वेति सर्वदा॥ दुर्योधन नाभ्यगृह्णानमूढः पथ्यमिवौषधम्।<br />The stupid Duryodhana did not accept the constant advice of Yudhishthira viz. do not fight, which was like the wholesome drug.</p>
<p id='23'>शरतल्पे शयानेन भीष्मेण सुमहात्मना॥ पानीयं याचितः पार्थः सोऽविध्यन्पेदिनीतलम्। जलस्य धारां जनितां दृष्ट्वा पाण्डुसुतेन च॥ अब्रवीत् स महाबाहुस्तात संशाम्य पाण्डवैः। प्रशमाद्धि भवेच्छान्तिर्मदन्तं युद्धमस्तु वः॥ भ्रातृभावेन पृथिवी भुक्ष्व पाण्डुसुतैः सह।<br />Being asked for water by Bhishma, lying on his arrowy bed, Partha of great fame pierced the surface of the earth. Having seen the torrent of water flowing from the surface of the earth caused by the son of Pandu, that mighty-armed hero addressed him saying-"O son, do you conclude peace with the Pandavas." Stop all hostilities and then there will be peace. Let your war be concluded with my death. Do you enjoy sovereignty over the earth in brotherly feelings with the sons of Pandu.</p>
<p id='24'>अकुर्वन् वचनं तस्य नूनं शोचति पुत्रकः॥ तदिदं समनुप्राप्तं वचनं दीर्घदर्शनः।<br />am Having disregarded the advice of that one of long foresight, my son is surely repenting that advice of his is now realised into its effect..</p>
<p id='25'>अहं तु निहतामात्यो हतपुत्रश्च संजय॥ द्यूततः कृच्छ्रमापन्नो लूनपक्ष इव द्विजः।<br />O Sanjaya, I, who deprived of counsellor and sons, have too, obtained great misery consequent upon the game at dice, like a bird shorn of its wings.</p>
<p id='26'>यथा हि शकुनि गृह्य छित्वा पक्षौ च संजय॥ विसर्जयन्ति संहृष्टाः क्रीडमानाः कुमारकाः। लूनपक्षतया तस्य गमनं नोपपद्यते॥ तथाऽमहपि सम्प्राप्तो लूनपक्ष इव द्विजः।<br />O Sanjaya, even as the playful boys having caught a bird and torn off its wings most cheerfully let it go. And whose (the bird's) flight does not become possible in consequence of the loss of its wings; so I have become (motionless) like the bird deprived of its wings.</p>
<p id='27'>क्षीणः सर्वार्थहीनश्च निर्घातिबन्धुवर्जितः। को दिशं प्रतिपत्स्यामि दीनः शत्रुवशं गतः॥<br />Now I am weak, destitute of all resources and deprived of all kinsmen and left my friends and also I am poor and possessed by my foes-To what point of the horizon shall I depart?</p>
<p id='28'>वैशम्पायन उवाच इत्येवं धृतराष्ट्रोऽथ विलप्य बहु दुःखितः। प्रोवाच संजय भूयः शोकव्याकुलमानसः॥<br />Vaishampayana said Dhritarashtra wailed so deep, became impatient in vagary of agony and grief and again said Sanjaya the following words-</p>
<p id='29'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच योऽजयत् सर्वकाम्बोजानम्बष्ठान् केकयैः सह। गान्धाराचं विदेहांश्च जित्वा कार्यार्थमाहवे॥ दुर्योधनस्य वृद्ध्यर्थं योऽजयत् पृथिवी प्रभुः। स जितः पाण्डवैः शूरैः समरे बाहुशालिभिः॥<br />Dhritarashtra said Who subdued all the Kambojas an the Ambashthas along with the Kekayas and the Gandharas and the Videhas; and having defeated them in battle for the fulfillment of his wishes. That lord subdued the entire earth for the aggrandisement of Duryodhana. But he himself was subdued by the heroic Pandavas of immense capacity and mighty arms.</p>
<p id='30'>तस्मिन् हते महेष्वासे कर्णे युधि किरीटिना। के वीराः पर्यतिष्ठन्त तन्ममाचक्ष्व संजय॥<br />When that mighty bowman Karna was slain in battle by the holder of Kiriti (Arjuna), what other heroes were still waiting in the field. Tell me this, O Sanjaya.</p>
<p id='31'>कचिन्नैकः परित्यक्तः पाण्डवैर्निहतो रणे। उक्तं त्वया पुरा तात यथा वीरो निपातितः॥<br />Was he not alone and forlorn, while slain by the Pandavas in battle? O son, it was told by you beforehand how the heroes my side were slain.</p>
<p id='32'>भीष्ममप्रतियुद्ध्यन्तं शिखण्डी सायकोत्तमैः। पातयामास समरे सर्वशस्त्रभृतां वरम्॥<br />Shikhandin slew in battle, by means of the best of his darts, that great wielder of all weapons, Bhishma, who did not care for repelling the foes.</p>
<p id='33'>तथा द्रौपदिना द्रोणो न्यस्यसर्वायुधो युधि। युक्तयोगो महेष्वासः शरैर्बहुभिराचितः॥ निहतः खङ्गमुद्यम्य धृष्टद्युम्नेन संजय। अन्तरेण हतावेतौ छलेन च विशेषतः॥<br />So also, O Sanjaya, by Dhristadyumna, the son of Drupada, lifting up his sword, was slain that mighty bowman Drona, practising severe asceticisin, who, being already pierced by innumerable weapons had put aside all his weapons in battle. I have, indeed, heard of this, viz. that these two, Bhishma and Drona, were slain at a disadvantage and especially by means of a stratagem.</p>
<p id='34'>अश्रौषमहमेतद् वै भीष्मद्रोणौ निपातितौ। भीष्मद्रोणौ हि समरे न हन्याद् वज्रभृत् स्वयम्॥ न्यायेन युध्यमानौ हि तद् वै सत्यं ब्रवीमि ते।<br />Surely even the wielder of the thunderbolt (Indra) himself cannot slay in battle by just means both Bhishma and Drona, while contending in battle. Indeed, that I tell you truly.</p>
<p id='35'>कर्णं त्वस्यन्तमस्त्राणि दिव्यानि च बहूनि च॥ कथमिन्द्रोपमं वीरं मृत्युर्युद्धे समस्पृशत्।<br />While Karna was engaged in throwing down his innumerable celestial weapons in battle, how could Death touch that hero who was like Indra himself?</p>
<p id='36'>यस्य विद्युत्प्रभा शक्तिं दिव्यां कनकभूषणाम्॥ प्रायच्छद् द्विषतां हन्त्री कुण्डलाभ्यां पुरंदरः। यस्य सर्पमुखो दिव्यः शरः काञ्चनभूषणः॥ अशेत निहितः पत्री समरेष्वरिसूदनः। भीष्मद्रोणमुखान् वीरान् योऽवमन्ये महारथान्॥ जामदग्न्यान्महाघोरं ब्राह्ममस्त्रमशिक्षत। यश्च द्रोणमुखान् दृष्ट्वा विमुखानर्दिताशरैः॥ सौभद्रस्य महाबाहुर्व्यधमत् कार्मुकं शितैः। यश्च नागायुतप्राणं वज्ररंहसमच्यतुम्॥ विरथं सहसा कृत्वा भीमसेनमथाहसत्। सहदेवं च निर्जित्य शरैः संनतपर्वभिः॥ कृपया विरथं कृत्वा नाहनद् धर्मचिन्ता। यश्च मायासहस्राणि विकुर्वाणं जयैषिणम्॥ घटोत्कचं राक्षसेन्द्रं शक्रशक्त्या निजनिवान्। एतांश्च दिवसान् यस्य युद्धे भीतो धनंजयः॥ नागमद् द्वैरथं वीरः स कथं निहतो रणे।<br />Purandara awarded that here, in exchange for his ear-rings, that celestial dust that had the splendour of lightning and also that was decked in gold and capable of destroying the foes. Whose that heroes' celestial arrow, known by the name of Snakemouthed, that was decked in gold and besmeared with soft sandal and also that was capable of slaying the enemies, was always laid up in the quiver. Having disregarded the heroic great car-warriors with Bhishma and Drona at their head, that hero, O mighty monarch, learnt the use of the Brahma weapon from the son of Jamadagni. Having seen the great warriors, with Drona at their head, deeply pierced by the arrows and turning away from the battle, that mighty-armed one had severed to a the the bow of the son of Subhadra by means of his sharp arrows. Having deprived, all on sudden, Bhimasena of his car, who was of never-failing energy and had the speed of wind and the strength of ten thousand elephants, that (mighty-armed) one afterwards laughed at him. Having subdued Sahadeva by means of his sharp and straight arrows and also having deprived him of his car, he did not slay him out of kindness and feelings of virtue. He had slain, by means of his arrow given to him by Shakra, Ghatotkacha, the lord of Rakshasas, who had made a thousand illusions and who was most desirous of victory. How could that hero be slain in battle, with whom even Dhananjaya was afraid to engage in a single combat for several days.</p>
<p id='37'>संशप्तकानां योधा ये आह्वयन्त सदान्यतः॥ एतान् हत्वा हनिष्यामि पश्चाद् वैकर्तन रणे। इति व्यपदिशन् पार्थो वर्जयन् सूतजं रणे॥ स कथं निहतो वीरः पार्थेन परवीरहा।<br />How Arjuna, the killer of chivalrous enemy in battle had killed the great warrior Karna who used to escape him in battle-field under pretext that-"I will slaughter Vaikartana Karna subsequent to kill the warriors who challenge me for battle toward another side?</p>
<p id='38'>रथभङ्गो न चेत् तस्य धनुर्वा न व्यशीर्यत॥ न चेदस्त्राणि निर्णेशुः स कथं नहतः परैः।<br />When his car was not broken, nor his bow was cut-off, nor his weapons were exhausted, how could he (Karna), therefore, be slain by the enemies?</p>
<p id='39'>को हि शक्तो रणे कर्णं विधुन्वानं महद् धनुः॥ विमुञ्चन्तं शरान् घोरान् दिव्यान्यस्त्राणि चाहवे। जेतुं पुरुषशार्दूलं शार्दूलमिव वेगिनम्॥<br />Who, indeed, was able to subdue Karna in battle, that foremost of persons, possessed of the speed of a tiger, while that mighty bowman was shaking his bow and shooting forth his terrible arrows and exhausting his celestial weapons in battle.</p>
<p id='40'>ध्रुवं तस्य धनुश्छिन्नं रथो वापि महीं गतः। अस्त्राणि वा प्रणष्टानि यथा शंससि मे हतम्॥<br />Surely his bow-string was torn; his car was engulfed in the earth; and his weapons were all spent, because you tell me that he was slain.</p>
<p id='41'>न ह्यन्यदपि पश्यामि कारणं तस्य नाशने। न हन्मि फाल्गुनं यावत् तावत् पादौ न धावये॥ इति यस्य महाघोरं व्रतमासीन्महात्मनः।<br />Indeed, I do not find any other cause of his slaughter. 'I will not have my feet washed, so long as I do not slay Falguna.' This was highly the terrible vow of the high-souled one.</p>
<p id='42'>यस्य भीतो रणे निद्रां धर्मराजो युधिष्ठिरः॥ त्रयोदश समा नित्यं नाभजत् पुरुषर्षभः। यस्य वीर्यवतो वीर्यमुपाश्रित्य महात्मनः॥ मम पुत्रः सभां भार्या पाण्डूनां नीतवान् बलात्। तत्रापि त सभामध्ये पाण्डवानां च पश्यताम्॥ दासभार्येति पाञ्चलीमब्रवीत् कुरुसंनिधौ। न सन्ति पतयः कृष्णे सर्वे षण्ढतिलैः समाः॥ उपतिष्ठस्व भर्तारमन्यं वा वरवर्णिनि। इत्येवं यः पुरा वाचो रूक्षाश्चाश्रवयन् रुषा॥ सभायां सूतजः कृष्णं स कथं निहतः परैः।<br />Being afraid of him, the foremost of person Yudhishthira, the royal impersonation of justice, could not enjoy sleep, while exiled in the forest, for a period of thirteen years. Relaying upon the prowess of that high-souled hero of great energy, my son forcibly dragged the wife of the Pandavas to the assembly-hall. There in the midst of that assembly, that one (Karna) called the Princess of Panchala, in the very sight of the Pandavas and also in the presence of all the Kuru's, the wife of slaves. 'O Krishna (Panchali), all your husbands are no more; and if they really exist, they are more like the sesamum seeds without the Kernel. So do you, O beautiful lady, choose another husband.' That person of the Suta race had made, anger, Krishna listen to these harsh expressions in the midst of the assembly. How was he slain by the enemies?</p>
<p id='43'>यदि भीष्मो रणश्लाघी द्रोणो वा युधि दुर्मदः॥ न हनिष्यति कौन्तेयान् पक्षपातात् सुयोधन। पुनस्तात पाण्डवैः। सर्वानेव हनिष्यामि व्येतु ते मानसो ज्वरः॥ किं करिष्यति गाण्डीवमक्षय्यौ च महेषुधी। स्निग्धचन्दनदिग्धस्य मच्छरस्यभिधावतः॥ स नूनमृषभस्कन्धो ह्यर्जुनेन कथं हतः। यश्च गाण्डीवमुक्तानां स्पर्शमुग्रमचिन्तयन्॥ अपतिसि कृष्णेति ब्रुवन् पार्थानवैक्षत। यस्य नासीद् भयं पार्थैः सपुत्रैः सजनार्दनैः॥ स्वबाहुलमाश्रित्य मुहूर्तमपि संजय। तस्य नाहं वधं मन्ये देवैरपि सवासवैः॥ प्रतीपमभिधावद्भिः किं<br />That hero, having disregarded the severe touch of the shots from the Gandiva bow, addressed Krishna, saying,'Doubtless you have no husbands;' and he also cast his glance upon the sons of Pritha. Again, O Sanjaya, placing confidence upon the strength of his own arms, that hero had no fear even for a moment, aroused by the sons of Pritha accompanied as they were by their sons and Janardana himself. I do not consider that his slaughter can ever be brought about by all the celestials, rushing against him, headed by Vashava himself. Again, O son, how can it by the Pandavas?</p>
<p id='44'>न हि ज्यां संस्पृशानस्य तलने वाऽपि गृह्णतः॥ पुमानाधिरथेः स्थातुं कश्चित् प्रमुखतोऽर्हति। अपि स्यान्मेदिनी हीना सोमसूर्यप्रभांशुभिः॥ न वधः पुरुषेन्द्रस्य संयुगेष्वपलायिनः।<br />While that son of Atiratha had touched the bow-string and put on his fences, surely there was no person, who could be bold enough to stand up in his front. Indeed, the earth might be deprived of the splendour of the Moon and the rays of the Sun; but the slaughter of the lord of men who did never turn away from the field could not be possible in battle.</p>
<p id='45'>येन मन्दः सहायेन भ्रात्रा दुःशासनेन च॥ वासुदेवस्य दुर्बुद्धिः प्रत्याख्यानमरोचत। स नूनं वृषभस्कन्धं कर्णं दृष्ट्वा निपातितम्॥ दुःशासनं च निहत् मन्ये शोचति पुत्रकः।<br />Having been assisted by that hero as well as by his brother Dushasana, that my evil-souled and wicked-minded son had resolved upon to reject the proposals of Vasudeva himself. I consider that my son, having witnessed the fall of Karna of bull like shoulders and also having seen the slaughter of Dushasana, is surely lamenting.</p>
<p id='46'>हतं वैकर्तनं श्रुत्वा द्वैरथे सव्यसाचिना॥ जयतः पाण्डवान् दृष्ट्वा किंस्विदं दुर्योधनऽब्रवीत्।<br />Having seen that the son of Vikartana was slain by Savyasachin in a single combat and that the Pandavas were victorious, what, indeed, did Duryodhana say?</p>
<p id='47'>दुर्मर्षणं हतं दृष्ट्वा वृषसेनं च संयुगे॥ प्रभग्नं च बलं दृष्ट्वा वध्यमानं महारथैः। पराङ्मुखांश्च राज्ञस्तु पलायनपरायणान्॥ विद्रुतान् रथिनो दृष्ट्वा मन्ये शोचति पुत्रकः।<br />Having seen that both Durmarsana and Vrishasena were slain in battle and also having witnessed that his army being slaughtered by the mighty car-warriors, was dispersed and again, having seen that the kings (in his side), most unwilling to fight, were turning away from the field of battle and having beheld the great car-warriors already fled, I think my son is now surely lamenting.</p>
<p id='48'>अनेयश्चाभिमानी च दुर्बुद्धिरजितेन्द्रियः॥ हतोत्साहं बलं दृष्ट्वा किंस्विद् दुर्योधनऽब्रवीत्।<br />What did that undaunted, proud and evil souled Duryodhana of uncontrolled passions say, after beholding his army grown pretty well dispirited?</p>
<p id='49'>स्वयं वैरं महत् कृत्वा वार्यमाणः सुहृद्गणैः॥ प्रधने हतभूयिष्ठैः किंस्विद् दुर्योधनऽब्रवीत्।<br />Although having been forbidden by the friends, yet himself having created this fierce hostility, what did Duryodhana say, after beholding the slaughter of innumerable soldiers in battle?</p>
<p id='50'>भ्रातरं निहतं दृष्ट्वा भीमसेनेन संयुगे॥ रुधिरे पीयमाने च किंस्विद् दुर्योधनऽब्रवीत्।<br />Having seen that his brother was slain in battle and his blood was drunk by Bhimasena, what did Duryodhana say? w</p>
<p id='51'>सह गान्धारराजेन सभायां यदभाषत्॥ कर्णोऽर्जुनं रणे हन्ता हते तस्मिन किमब्रवीत्।<br />He (my son) said in the midst of the assembly-hall with the king of the Gandharas that Karna would slay Arjuna in battle. But how having seen that hero slain, what did he (Duryodhana) say?</p>
<p id='52'>द्यूतं कृत्वा पुरा हृष्टो वञ्चयित्वा च पाण्डवान्॥ शकुनिः सौबलस्तात हते कर्णे किमब्रवीत्।<br />O son, when Karna was slain, what did Shakuni, the son of Subala, having at first played at dice with a cheerful heart and deceived the son of Pandu, say?</p>
<p id='53'>कृतवर्मा महेष्वासः सात्वतानां महारथः॥ हतं वैकर्तनं दृष्ट्वा हार्दिक्यः किमभाषत।<br />Beholding the son of Vikartana (slain in battle), what did that son of Hridika, Kritavarman, that mighty bowman, that great car-warrior amongst the Satvatas, say?</p>
<p id='54'>ब्राह्मणाः क्षत्रिया वैश्या यस्य शिक्षामुपासते॥ धनुर्वेद चिकीर्षन्तो द्रोणपुत्रस्य धीमतः। युवा रूपेण सम्पन्नो दर्शनीयो महायशाः॥ अश्वत्थामा हते कर्णे किमभाषत संजय।<br />O Sanjaya, Most willing to acquire a knowledge in archery, the Brahmanas, the Kshatriyas and the Vaishyas received instructions of that highly intellectual son of Drona. What did that youthful, that handsomelooking, that highly famous Ashvatthaman, endued with beauty, say, when he saw Karna slain in battle?</p>
<p id='55'>आचार्यो यो धनुर्वेद गौतमो रथसत्तमः॥ कृपः शारद्वतस्तात हते कर्णे किमब्रवीत्।<br />What did that son of Sharadvata, Kripa of the Gautama race, that mighty, car-warrior, that teacher of archery, say when he saw Karna slain in battle?</p>
<p id='56'>मद्रराजो महेष्वासः शल्यः समितिशोभनः॥ दृष्ट्वा विनिहतं कर्णं सारथ्ये रथिनां वरः। किमभाषत वीरोऽसौ मद्राणामधिपो बली॥<br />On beholding the slaughter of Karna, what did the king of Madras, that mighty bowman, that ornament of assemblies, Shalya of the Shauvira tribe, that foremost of charioteers engaged in driving away the car (of Karna), that leading chief of the Madra warriors, who was possessed of mighty strength, say?</p>
<p id='57'>दृष्ट्वा विनिहतं सर्वे योधा वा रणदुर्जयाः। ये च केचन राजानः पृथिव्यां यो मागताः। वैकर्तनं हतं दृष्ट्वा कान्यभाषन्त संजय॥<br />And again, O Sanjaya, what did the other warriors, who with difficulty could be vanquished, as well as all the kings of the earth, who had come with the desire of fighting, say, when they beheld the slaughter of the son of Vikartana?</p>
<p id='58'>द्रोणे तु निहते वीरे रथव्याने नरर्षभे। के वा मुखमनीकानामासन् संजय भागशः॥<br />When that hero, that foremost of the carwarriors, that best among men, Drona was slain (in battle), who, O Sanjaya, had been the leaders of the several divisions of the army in succession?</p>
<p id='59'>मद्रराजः कथं शल्यो नियुक्तो रथिनां वरः। वैकर्तनस्य सारथ्ये तन्ममाचक्ष्व संजय॥<br />O Sanjaya, do you relate to me, how Shalya, the king of the Madras, that best among all the car-warriors, was engaged as the charioteer of the son of Vikartana?</p>
<p id='60'>केऽरक्षनं दक्षिणं चक्रं सूतपुत्रस्य युध्यतः। वामं चक्रं ररक्षुर्वा के वा वीरस्य पृष्ठतः॥<br />While the son of Suta was fighting, who were the persons guarding his right wheel and those who protected his left and again, who were they that guarded his back.</p>
<p id='61'>के क्षुद्राः प्राद्रवंस्ततः। कथं च वः समेतानां हतः कर्णो महारथः॥<br />What heroes did not forsake Karna and what mean-minded men flew away from him? While you had been present in the field, how could that mighty car-warrior be slain in battle?</p>
<p id='62'>पाण्डवाश्च स्वयं शूराः प्रत्युदीयुर्महारथाः। सृजन्तः शरवर्षाणि वारिधारा इवाम्बुदाः॥ स च सर्पमुखो दिव्यो महेषुप्रवरस्तदा। के कर्णं न जहुः शूराः व्यर्थः कथं समभवत् तन्ममाचक्ष्व संजय॥<br />O Sanjaya, How could the heroic and great car-warriors oppose the Pandavas, who were pouring forth showers of arrows like the clouds pouring forth drops of water. Do you relate to me, how then could that celestial snakemouthed arrow, that best one of its kind, become of no avail?</p>
<p id='63'>मामकस्यास्य सैन्यस्य हतोत्सेधस्य संजय। अवशेषं न पश्यामि ककुदे मृदिते सति॥<br />When the best of the leaders were slain, I do not see, O Sanjaya, that even some of the soldiers of my side, who had already lost their courage, will survive (the terrible slaughter).</p>
<p id='64'>तौ हि वीरौ महेष्वासौ मदर्थे त्यक्तजीवितौ। भीष्मद्रोणौ हतौ श्रुत्वा को न्वर्थो जीवितेन मे॥<br />Indeed, those two heroes, the great bowmen, were ready to give up their lives for my sake. Hearing of their (Bhishma and Drona) death, what use have I of my life?</p>
<p id='65'>पुनः पुनर्न मृष्यामि हतं कर्णं च पाण्डवैः। यस्य बाह्वोर्बलं तुल्यं कुञ्जराणां शतं शतैः॥<br />Again and again, I cannot bear that Karna should be slain by the Pandavas; for whose strength of arms is equal to that of ten thousand elephants.</p>
<p id='66'>द्रोणे हते च यद् वृत्तं कौरवाणां परैः सह। संग्रामे नरवीराणां तन्ममाचक्ष्व संजय॥<br />O Sanjaya, relate to me in detail what had happened in the battle that raged between the mighty heroes among men, namely, the Kauravas and their enemies, when Drona was slain.</p>
<p id='67'>यथा कर्णश्च कौन्तेयैः सह युद्धमयोजयत्। यथा च द्विषतां हन्ता रणे शान्तस्तदुच्यताम्॥<br />Relate to me also how the sons of Kunti conducted the battle with Karna and do you tell me, again, how that slayer of enemies became quiet (was slain) in battle.</p>
