<h3>KARNA PARVA: Chapter 3</h3><h4>The speech of Sanjaya</h4><p id='1'>संजय उवाच हते द्रोणे महेष्वासे तव पुत्रा महारथाः। बभूवुरस्वस्थमुखा विषण्णा गतचेतसः॥<br />Sanjaya said When that mighty bowman Drona, was slain, your sons, the great car-warriors, became pale-faced, gloomy and senseless.</p>
<p id='2'>अवाङ्मुखाः शस्त्रभृतः सर्व अप्रेक्षमाणाःशोकार्ता नाभ्यभाषन् परस्परम्॥ एव विशाम्पते। तु<br />And O king, all those who were armed with the weapons, stood speechless; and highly oppressed with grief, they neither beheld nor spoke any words to one another.</p>
<p id='3'>तान् दृष्ट्वा व्यथिताकारान् सैन्यानि तव भारत। ऊर्ध्वमेव निरैक्षन्त दुःखत्रस्यान्यनेकशः॥<br />descendant of the Bharata race, seeing them changed in countenance, on account of their being oppressed with sorrow, your troops, themselves being highly afflicted with grief and anxiety, looked upwards.</p>
<p id='4'>शस्त्राण्येषां राजेन्द्र शोणिताक्तानि सर्वशः। प्राभ्रश्यन्त करोग्रेभ्यो दृष्ट्वा द्रोणं हतं युधि॥<br />Beholding the death of Drona in battle, O foremost of kings, the weapons of many of them, indeed besmeared with blood, dropped down from their hands.</p>
<p id='5'>तानि बद्धान्यरिष्टानि लम्बमानानि भारत। अदृश्यन्त महाराज नक्षत्राणि यथा दिवि॥<br />O great monarch, O descendant of the Bharata race, several of those (weapons), still retained by the troops in the various parts of their bodies, were seen hanging, like the meteors of heaven (pending from above).</p>
<p id='6'>तथा तु स्तिमितं दृष्ट्वा गतसत्त्वमवस्थितम्। बलं तव महाराज राजा दुर्योधनोऽब्रवीत्॥<br />O great monarch, seeing your force (his own troops) thus eclipsed (by that of the Pandavas) and standing as if lifeless, king</p>
<p id='7'>भवतां बाहुवीर्यं हि समाश्रित्य मया युधि। पाण्डवेयाः : समाहूता युद्धं चेदं प्रवर्तितम्॥<br />Depending upon the strength of your arms this war had been entered into and the descendants of Pandu had also been summoned to the battle by me.</p>
<p id='8'>तदिदं निहते द्रोणे विषण्णमिव लक्ष्यते। युध्यमानाश्च समरे योधा वध्यन्ति सर्वशः॥<br />But you, however, look very cheerless (dispirited) now in the death of Drona. All the warriors engaged in battle are slain in battle.</p>
<p id='9'>जयो वापि क्धो वापि युध्यमानस्य संयुगे। भवेत् किमत्र चित्रं वै युध्यध्वं सर्वतोमुखाः॥<br />Victory or death falls to the lot of one who is engaged in battle. What wonder then there is in this (the fall of Drona)? So do you fight with your faces in all directions.</p>
<p id='10'>पश्यध्वं च महात्मानं कर्णं वैकर्तनं युधि। प्रचरन्तं महेष्वासं दिव्यैरस्त्रैर्महाबलम्॥<br />Do you behold that lofty-minded Karna, the son of Vikartana, that highly powerful and mighty bowman-that wielder of celestial weapons, who is roving about in the (field of) battle.</p>
<p id='11'>यस्य वै युधि संत्रासात् कुन्तीपुत्रो धनंजयः। निवर्तते सदा मन्दः सिहात् क्षुद्रमृगो यथा।॥<br />Through fear, indeed, Dhananjaya-that coward son of Kunti, always flies away from him in battle, even as the small deer (does) froni a lion.</p>
<p id='12'>येन नागायुतप्राणो भीमसेनो महाबलः। मानुषेणैव युद्धेन तामवस्थां प्रवेशितः॥<br />It is by him that Bhimasena of mighty strength, endowed with the force of ten thousand elephants, was brought, through the tactics of warfare that are peculiar to man, into the same circumstance.</p>
<p id='13'>येन दिव्यास्त्रविच्छूरो मायावी स घटोत्कचः। अमोघया रणे शक्त्या निहतो भैरवं नदन्॥<br />It is by him that Ghatotkacha, thai wielder of celestial weapon, that god, that enchanter, that one who made a tremendous roar, was slain in battle through the most indomitable power.</p>
<p id='14'>तस्य दुर्वारवीर्यस्य सत्यसंधस्य धीमतः। बाह्वोर्द्रविणमक्षय्यमद्य द्रक्ष्यथ संयुगे॥<br />Do you behold today in battle the inexhaustible strength of arms of that intellectual one, who is of unsubdued energy and of fixed purpose.</p>
<p id='15'>द्रोणपुक्षस्य विक्रान्तं राधेयस्यैव चोभयोः। पश्यन्तु पाण्डुपुत्रास्ते विष्णुवासवयोरिव॥<br />Do you behold today the prowess of both the son of Drona and the son of Radha who are high-souled, among the troops of the Pandus and the Panchalas.</p>
<p id='16'>सर्व एव भवन्तश्च शक्ताः प्रत्येकशोऽपि वा। पाण्डुपुत्रान् रणे हन्तुं ससैन्यान् किमुसंहताः॥<br />All of you are, however, capable of slaying in battle the sons of Pandu with their troops even fighting singly. What then, when fighting together? Endowed with immense strength and acquainted with the use of weapons, do you behold today one another (engaged in battle).</p>
<p id='17'>संजय उवाच वीर्यवन्तः कृतास्त्राश्च द्रक्ष्यथाद्य परस्परम्। एवमुक्त्वा ततः कर्णं चके सेनापति तदा। तव पुत्रो महावीर्यो भ्रातृभिः सहितोऽनघ॥<br />Sanjaya said O faultless one, having thus addressed, you son (Duryodhana) of mighty prowess, (after having consulted) with his brothers, afterwards made Karna the generallissimo (of the Kuru troops).</p>
<p id='18'>सैनापत्यमथावाप्य कर्णो राजन् महारथः। सिंहनादं विनद्योचैः प्रायुध्यत रणोत्कटः॥<br />O king, after having obtained the generalship (of the Kuru army) the mighty carwarrior Karna, invincible in battle, engaged himself in battle, making a tremendous roar like a lion.</p>
<p id='19'>स सृञ्जयानां सर्वेषां पञ्चालानां च मारिष। केकयानां विदेहानां चकार कदनं महत्॥<br />He caused a great slaughter among the Srinjayas, all the Panchalas, the Kekayas and the Videhas, in the sight of all.</p>
<p id='20'>तस्येषुधाराः शतशः प्रादुरासञ्छरासनात्। अग्रे पुढेषु संसक्ता यथा भ्रमरपङ्क्तयः॥<br />Hundreds of arrows most fearfully issued from his bow, one closely following the wings of another like the lines of bees (flying away from the hive).</p>
<p id='21'>स पीडयित्वा पञ्चालान् पाण्डवांश्च तरस्विनः। हत्वा सहस्रशो योधानर्जुनेन निपातितः॥२१<br />Having oppressed the Pandavas and the Panchalas, of immense activity and killed thousands of heroes, he, at last, was slain by Arjuna. Having oppressed the Pandavas and the Panchalas, of immense activity and killed thousands of heroes, he, at last, was slain by Arjuna.</p>
