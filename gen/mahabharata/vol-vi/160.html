<h3>Gadayuddha Parva: Chapter 64</h3><h4>Dhritarashtra's enquiring how Duryodhana met his death with his thighs broken and the last words that fell from him, Sanjaya narrates to the old king the lamentations of Duryodhanas his message to the three surviving Kauravas and his commands to inform his friend Charvaka of the circumstances of his death. The messengers' arrival to the camp of Drona's son. They communicate him his last words</h4><p id='1'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच अधिष्ठितः पदा मूर्ध्नि भग्नसक्थो महीं गतः। शौटीर्यमानी पुत्रो मे किमभाषत संजय॥ अत्यर्थं कोपनो राजा जातवैरश्च पाण्डुषु। व्यसनं परमं प्राप्तः किमाह परमाहवे॥<br />Dhritarashtra said "Struck on the head, his thighs broken, laid low on the ground, exceedingly proud, what, O Sanjaya, did my son then say? King Duryodhana was highly wrathful and his enmity to the sons of Pandu was deep-scated. When therefore, this great calamity befell him, what did he next say on the field?"</p>
<p id='2'>संजय उवाच शृणु राजन् प्रवक्ष्यामि यथावृत्तं नराधिप। राज्ञा यदुक्तं भग्नेन तस्मिन् व्यसन आगते॥<br />Sanjaya said "Hear me, O king, as I describe what took place. Listen, O king, to what Duryodhana said when possessed by misfortune.</p>
<p id='3'>भग्नसक्थो नृपो राजन् पांसुना सोऽवगुण्ठितः। यमयन् मूर्धजास्तत्र वीक्ष्य चैव दिशो दश॥<br />With his thighs broken, the king, O king, covered with dust, collected his flowing locks, looking all sides.</p>
<p id='4'>केशान् नियम्य यत्नेन निःश्वसनुरगो यथा। संरम्भाश्रुपरीताभ्यां नेत्राभ्यामभिवीक्ष्य माम्॥ बाहू धरण्यां निष्यिष्य सुदुर्मत्त इव द्विपः।<br />Having with difficulty gathered his locks, he began to sigh like a serpent. Filled with ire and with tears flowing quickly from his eyes, he looked at me. He struck his arms against the Earth for some time like an infuriate elephant.</p>
<p id='5'>प्रकीर्णान् मूर्धजान् धुन्वन् दन्तैर्दन्तानुपस्पृशन्॥ गर्हयन् पाण्डवं ज्येष्ठः निःश्वस्येदमथाब्रवीत्। भीष्मे शान्तनवे नाथे कर्णे शस्त्रभृतां वरे॥ गौतमे शकुनौ चापि द्रोणे चास्त्रभृतां वरे। अश्वत्थाम्न तथा शल्ये शूरे च कृतवर्मणि॥ इमामवस्थां प्राप्तोऽस्मि कालो हि दुरतिक्रमः।<br />Shaking his loose locks, and gnashing his teeth, he began to blame the eldest son of Alas, I who had Shantanu's son Bhishma for my protector, and Karna, that foremost of all warriors, Gotama's son, Shakuni. Drona, Ashvatthaman, the heroic Shalya, and Kritavarman, have been reduced to this plight. It seems that Destiny is all powerful.</p>
<p id='6'>समयं हतः। एकादशचमूभर्ता सोऽहमेतां दशां गतः॥ कालं प्राप्य महाबाहो न कश्चिदतिवर्तते।<br />I was the master of eleven Chamus of troops and yet I have come by this plight. O mighty-armed one, no one can control Destiny.</p>
<p id='7'>आख्यातव्यं मदीयानां येऽस्मिञ्जीवन्ति संयुगे॥ यथाहं भीमसेनेन व्युत्क्रम्य<br />Those of my side that have escaped alive from this battle should be informed how I have been struck down by Bhimasena against the rules of fair fight.</p>
<p id='8'>बहूनि सुनृशंसानि कृतानि खलु पाण्डवैः॥ भूरिश्रवसि कर्णे च भीष्मे द्रोणे च श्रीमति।<br />Many unfair and sinful acts have been perpetrated towards Bhurishravas, Bhishma, and Drona.</p>
<p id='9'>इदं चाकीर्तिजं कर्म नृशंसैः पाण्डवैः कृतम्॥ येन ते सत्सु निर्वेदं गमिष्यन्ति हि मे मतिः।<br />This is another very unfair act that the cruel Pandavas have perpetrated, for which, I am certain, they will incur the censure of all righteous men.</p>
<p id='10'>का प्रीतिः सत्त्वयुक्तस्य कृत्वोपाधिकृतं जयम्॥ को वा समयभेत्तारं बुधः सम्मन्तुमर्हति।<br />What pleasure can a pious man enjoy after having gained a victory by unfair acts? What wise man would approve of a person's disregarding the rules of equity?</p>
<p id='11'>अधर्मेण जयं लब्ध्वा को न हृष्येत पण्डितः॥ यथा संहृष्यते पापः पाण्डुपुत्रो वृकोदरः।<br />What learned man would rejoice after having gained victory by such unfair means as that vile wretch, Vrikodara, the son of Pandu, is rejoicing himself in glee.</p>
<p id='12'>किन्नु चित्रमितस्त्वद्य भग्नसक्थस्य यन्मम॥ क्रुद्धेन भीमसेनेन पादेन मृदितं शिरः।<br />What can be more surprising then this viz., that Bhimasena in anger should with his foot touch the head of one like me while lying with my thighs broken.</p>
<p id='13'>प्रतपन्तं श्रिया जुष्टं वर्तमानं च बन्धुषु॥ एवं कुर्यान्नरो यो हि स वै संजय पूजितः।<br />Is that person, O Sanjaya, an honorable man who behaves thus towards a great man, endued with prosperity, living in the midst of friends?</p>
<p id='14'>अभिज्ञौ युद्धधर्मस्य मम माता पिता च मे॥ तौ हि संजय दुःखार्ती विज्ञाप्यौ वचनाद्धि मे। इष्टं भृत्या भृताः सम्यग् भूः प्रशास्ता ससागरा॥ मूर्ध्नि स्थितममित्राणां जीवतामेव संजय।<br />My parents are not ignorant of the rules of warfare. As directed by me, O Sanjaya, tell them that are afflicted with grief these words: I have celebrated sacrifices, maintained a large number of servants properly governed the whole Earth with her seas, I stood on the heads of my living enemies.</p>
<p id='15'>दत्ता दाया यथाशक्ति मित्राणां च प्रियं कृतम्॥ अमित्रा बाधिताः सर्वे को नु स्वन्ततरो मया।<br />I gave wealth of my kinsmen to the best of my power and I did what my friends liked. I withstood all my enemies. Who is there that is more fortunate than myself? I have marched through enemy's kingdoms and commanded kings as slaves I have acted lovingly towards all I loved and liked. Who is there more fortunate then myself!</p>
<p id='16'>मानिता बान्धवाः सर्वे वश्यः सम्पूजितो जनः॥ त्रितयं सेवितं सर्वं को नु स्वन्ततरो मया। आज्ञप्तं नृपमुख्येषु मानः प्राप्तः सुदुर्लभः॥<br />I honored all my relations and looked to the well-being of all my dependants. I have observed the three objects of human existence. viz., Religion, Profit, and Pleasure. Who is there more fortunate then myself?</p>
<p id='17'>आजानेयैस्तथा यातं को नु स्वन्ततरो मया। यातानि परराष्ट्राणि नृपा भुक्ताश्च दासवत्॥ प्रियेभ्यः प्रकृतं साधु को नु स्वन्ततरो मया।<br />I commanded great kings, and acquired honor, unattainable by others, I always drove on the back of the very best of horses. Who is there more fortunate than myself?</p>
<p id='18'>अधीतं विधिवद् दत्तं प्राप्तमायुर्निरामयम्॥ स्वधर्मेण जिता लोकाः को नु स्वन्ततरो मया।<br />I studied the Vedas and made gifts according to the ordinance. I have passed my life in happiness. By observing the duties of my own order, I have secured for myself many abodes of blessedness in the regions of eternity. Who is there more fortunate than myself?</p>
<p id='19'>दिष्ट्या नाहं जितः संख्ये परान् प्रेष्यवदाश्रितः॥ दिष्ट्या मे विपुला लक्ष्मीप॑ते त्वन्यगता विभो।<br />By good luck, I have not been defeated in battle and subjected to the necessity of serving my foes as slaves. By good luck, O lord, it is only after my death that my rising Prosperity leaves me for waiting upon another!</p>

<p id='21'>दिष्ट्या नाहं परावृत्तो वैरात् प्राकृतवन्जितः॥ दिष्ट्या न विमति कांचिद् भजित्वा तु पराजितः। सुप्तं वाथं प्रमत्तं वा यथा हन्याद् विषेण वा॥ एवं व्युत्क्रान्तधर्मेण व्युत्क्रम्य समयं हतः।<br />By good luck, I was not defeated like an ordinary person. By good luck, I have not been defeated after I had done some mean act. Like killing a person who is aslecp or who is heedless, like killing one with poison, my destruction has taken place, for I have been killed unfairly against the rules of fair fight.</p>
<p id='22'>अश्वत्थामा महाभागः कृतवर्मा च सात्वतः॥ कृपः शारद्वतश्चैव वक्तव्या वचनान्मम। अधर्मेण प्रवृत्तानां पाण्डवानामनेकशः॥ विश्वासं समयघ्नानां न यूयं गन्तुमर्हथ। वार्तिकांश्चाब्रवीद् राजा पुत्रस्ते सत्यविक्रमः॥ अधर्माद् भीमसेनेन निहतोऽहं यथा रणे।<br />The highly blessed Ashvatthaman, and Kritavarman, of the Satwata race, and Sharadvat's son Kripa, should be told these words of mine, viz.-.

After this, your royal and bearers in these words:-I have, in battle, been killed by Bhimasena most unfairly.</p>
