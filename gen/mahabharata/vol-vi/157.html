'O son of Kansa's slave, it seems you have no shame, for you have forgotten that I have been struck down most unfairly, according to the rules of inacefighting? It was you who unfairly caused this act by reminding Bhima about the breaking of my thighs. Do you think I did not mark it when Arjuna (under your advice) hinted to it to Bhima?</p>
