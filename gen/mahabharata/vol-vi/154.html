<h3>Gadayuddha Parva: Chapter 58</h3><h4>The fall of Duryodhana</h4><p id='1'>संजय उवाच समुदीर्णं ततो दृष्ट्वा संग्रामें कुरुमुख्ययोः। अथाब्रवीदर्जुनस्तु वासुदेवं यशस्विनम्॥ अनयोरियोयुद्धे को ज्यायान् भवतो मतः। कस्य वा को गुणो भूयानेतद् वद जनार्दन॥<br />Sanjaya said “Seeing that fight thus ranging between those two greatest heroes of Kuru's race, Arjuna said to Vasudeva-'Who, in your superior between these two? What is their respective merit. Tell this, O</p>
<p id='2'>वासुदेव उवाच उपदेशोऽनयोस्तुल्यो भीमस्तु बलवत्तरः। कृती यत्नपरस्त्वेष धार्तराष्ट्रो वृकोदरात्॥<br />Vasudeva said The instruction received by them has been equal. Bhima, however, is possessed of greater me strength while Duryodhana is possessed of greater skill and has worked harder.</p>
<p id='3'>भीमसेनस्तु धर्मेण युद्ध्यमानो न जेष्यति। अन्यायेन तु युध्यन् वै हन्यादेव सुयोधनम्॥<br />If he were to fight fairly, Bhimasena will never succeed in gaining victory. If, however, he fights unfairly, he will surely be able to kill Duryodhana.</p>
<p id='4'>मायया निर्जिता देवैरसुरा इति नः श्रुतम्। विरोचनस्तु शक्रेण मायया निर्जितः स वै॥<br />The Asuras were defeated by the gods deceptively. We have heard this. Virochana was defeated by Shakra with the aid of deception.</p>
<p id='5'>मायया चाक्षिपत् तेजो वृत्रस्य बलसूदनः। तस्मान्मायामयं भीम आतिष्ठतु पराक्रमम्॥<br />The destroyer of Vala deprived Vritra his energy by an act of deception. Therefore, let Bhimasena put forth his prowess, by means of deception!</p>
<p id='6'>प्रतिज्ञातं च भीमेन द्यूतकाले धनंजय। ऊरू भेत्स्यामि ते संख्ये गदयेति सुयोधनम्॥<br />At the time of the gambling, O Dhananjaya, Bhima promised to break the thighs of Suyodhana with his mace in battle.</p>
<p id='7'>सोऽयं प्रतिज्ञां तां चापि पालयत्वरिकर्षणः। मायाविनं तु राजानं माययैव निकृन्ततु॥<br />Let this destroyer of foes, therefore, fulfill his vow. Let him, deceptively kill the Kuru king who is made of deception!</p>
<p id='8'>यद्येष बलमास्थाय न्यायेन प्रहरिष्यति। विषमस्थस्ततो राजा भविष्यति युधिष्ठिरः॥<br />If depending upon his might alone, Bhima were to fight fairly, king Yudhishthira will meet with great peril.</p>
<p id='9'>पुनरेव तु वक्ष्यामि पाण्डवेय निबोध मे। धर्मराजापराधेन भयं नः पुनरागतम्॥<br />I tell you again, O son of Pandu, listen to ine! It is through the fault of king Yudhishthira alone that danger has once more befallen us.</p>
<p id='10'>कृत्वा हि सुमहत् कर्म हत्वा भीष्ममुखान् कुरून्। जयः प्राप्तो यशः प्राग्र्यं वैरं च प्रतियातितम्॥<br />Having performed great feats by the destruction of Bhishma and the other Kurus, the king had gained victory and glory, and had almost terminated the hostilities.</p>
<p id='11'>तदेवं विजयः प्राप्तः पुनः संशयितः कृतः। अबुद्धिरेषा महती धर्मराजस्य पाण्डव॥ यदेकविजये युद्धं पाणितं घोरमीद्दशम्। सुयोधनः कृती वीर एकायनगतस्तथा॥<br />Having thus gained the victory, he pleased himself once more in a doubtful and perilous situation. This has been great mistake on the part of Yudhishthira, O Pandava, since he has made the result of the battle depend upon the victory or the defeat of only one warrior! Suyodhana is an expert, he is a hero; he is of firm determination.</p>
<p id='12'>अपि चोशनसा गीतः श्रूयतेऽयं पुरातनः। श्लोकस्तत्त्वार्थसहितस्तन्मे निगदतः शृणु॥<br />We have all heard the old verse uttered by Ushanas, Hear I recite it to you with its true sense and meaning!</p>
<p id='13'>पुनरावर्तमानानां भग्नानां जीवितैषिणाम्। भेतव्यमरिशेषाणामेकायनगता हि ते॥<br />The remnant of hostile force routed and flying away for life that really and come back to the fight, should always be feared, for they are of fixed determination and singleness of purpose!</p>
<p id='14'>साहसोत्पतितानां च निराशानां च जीविते। न शक्यमग्रतः स्थातुं शक्रेणापि धनंजय॥<br />Shakra himself O Dhananjaya, cannot stand before them who rush in fury, giving up all hopes of life.</p>
<p id='15'>सुयोधनमिमं भग्नं हतसैन्यं ह्रदं गतम्। पराजितं वनप्रेप्सुं निराशं राज्यलम्भने॥ को न्वेष संयुगे प्राज्ञः पुनर्द्वन्द्वे समाह्वयेत्। अपि नो निर्जितं राज्यं न हरेत सुयोधनः॥<br />This Suyodhana had been routed and fled. All his troops had been slain. He had entered the lake. He had been defeated, and, therefore, he had wished to retire into forest, having given up all hope of retaining his kingdom. What wise man is there, that would challenge such a person to a single-combat?</p>
<p id='16'>यस्त्रयोदशवर्षाणि गदया कृतनिश्रमः। चरत्यूर्ध्वं च तिर्यक् च भीमसेनजिघांसया॥<br />I do not know whether Duryodhana will regain the kingdom that had already become ours! For full thirteen years he practised with the mace with great firmness. Even now, for filling Bhimasena, he jumps up and down.</p>
<p id='17'>एनं चेन्न महाबाहुरन्यायेन हनिष्यति। एष वः कौरवो राजा धार्तराष्ट्रो भविष्यति॥ धनंजयस्तु श्रुत्वैतत् केशवस्य महात्मनः। प्रेक्षतो भीमसेनस्य सव्यमूरुमताडयत्॥<br />If the mighty-armed Bhima do not kill him unfairly, the son of Dhritarashtra will surely retain kingdom!?—Having heard those words of the great Keshava, Dhananjaya struck his own left thigh before the gaze of Bhimasena.</p>
<p id='18'>गृह्य संज्ञां ततो भीमो गदया व्यचरद् रणे। मण्डलानि विचित्राणि यमकानीतराणि च॥<br />Understanding that sign, Bhima began to move about with his uplifted mace making many kinds of manoeuvres.</p>
<p id='19'>दक्षिणं मण्डलं सव्यं गोमूत्रकमथापि च। व्यचरत् पाण्डवो राजन्नरिं सम्मोहयन्निव॥<br />Sometimes adopting the right Mandala, sometimes the left Mandala, and sometines Gomutraka, the son of Pandu began to move about, O king, stupefying his foe.</p>
<p id='20'>तथैव तव पुत्रोऽपि गदामार्गविशारदः। व्यचरल्लघु चित्रं च भीमसेनजिघांसया॥<br />Likewise your son O king, who was an adept in the mace fight, moved about beautifully and with great activity, for killing Bhimasena.</p>
<p id='21'>आधुन्वन्तो गदे घोरे चन्दनागरुरूषिते। वैरस्यान्तं परीप्सन्तौ रणे क्रुद्धाविवान्तकौ॥<br />Whirling their terrible maces which were smeared with sandal-paste and other unguents, the two heroes, desirous of terminating their hostilities, moved about in that battle like two angry Yamas.</p>
<p id='22'>अन्योन्यं तौ जिघांसन्तौ प्रवीरौ पुरुषर्षभौ। युयुधाते गरुत्मन्तौ तथा नागामिषैषिणौ॥<br />Desirous of killing each other, those two best of men, possessed of great heroism, fought like two Garudas desirous of catching the same snake.</p>
<p id='23'>मण्डलानि विचित्राणि चरतोपभीमयोः। गदासम्पातजास्तत्र प्रजजुः पावकार्चिषः॥<br />While the king and Bhima moved about in beautiful circles, their maces clashed, which created sparks of fire.</p>
<p id='24'>समं प्रहरतोस्तत्र शूरयोर्बलिनोर्मधे। क्षुब्धयोर्वायुना राजन् द्वयोरिव समुद्रयोः॥<br />Those two heroic and powerful warriors struck each other equally in that battle. They then resembled, O king, two oceans agitated by the tempest.</p>
<p id='25'>तयोः प्रहरतोस्तुल्यं मत्तकुञ्जरयोरिव। गदानिर्घातसंहादः प्रहाराणामजायत॥<br />Striking each other equally like two infuriate elephants, their clashing maces produced sounds like peals of thunder.</p>
<p id='26'>तस्मिंस्तदा सम्प्रहारे दारुणे संकुले भृशम्। उभावपि परिश्रान्तौ युध्यमानावरिंदमौ॥<br />During the onset of that dreadful battle, both those chastisers of foes, while fight became exhausted.</p>
<p id='27'>तौ मुहूर्तं समाश्वस्य पुनरेव परंतप। अभ्यहारयतां क्रुद्धो प्रगृह्य महती गदे॥<br />Having rested for a while, those two destroyers of foes, filled with rage and uplifting their maces, once more began to fight with each other.</p>
<p id='28'>तयोः समभवद् युद्धं घोररूपमसंवृतम्। गदानिपातै राजेन्द्र तक्षतोः परस्परम्॥<br />When, O king, by the repeated falls of their maces, they wounded each other, the battle became exceedingly dreadful and perfectly unrestrained.</p>
<p id='29'>समरे प्रद्रुतौ तौ तु वृषभाक्षौ तरस्विनौ। अन्योन्यं जनतुर्वीरौ पङ्कस्थौ महिषाविव॥<br />Rushing at each other in that fight, those two heroes, having eyes like those of bulls and gifted with great activity, struck each other fiercely like two buffaloes in the mire.</p>
<p id='30'>जर्जरीकृतसर्वाङ्गौ रुधिरेणाभिसप्लुतौ। दद्दशाते हिमवति पुष्पिताविव किंशुकौ॥<br />All their limbs wounded and bruised, and bathed in blood from head to foot, they looked like a couple of Kinshukas on the breast of Himavat.</p>
<p id='31'>दुर्योधनस्तु पार्थेन विवरे सम्प्रदर्शिते। ईषदुन्मिषमाणस्तु सहसा प्रससार ह॥<br />During the onset of the fight, when : Vrikodara, seemed to give Duryodhana an opportunity, the latter, smiling a little, advanced forward.</p>
<p id='32'>तमभ्याशगतं प्राज्ञो रणे प्रेक्ष्य वृकोदरः। अवाक्षिपद् गदां तस्मिन् वेगेन महता बली॥<br />Well-skilled in in battle, the powerful Vrikodara, seeing his adversary come up, suddenly hurled his mace at him.</p>
<p id='33'>आक्षिपन्तं तु तं दृष्ट्वा पुत्रस्तव विशाम्पते। अवासर्पत्ततः स्थानात् सा मोघा न्यपतद् भुवि॥<br />Seeing the mace thrown at him, your son, O king, moved away from that place at which the weapon fell down baffled.</p>
<p id='34'>मोक्षयित्वा प्रहारं तं सुतस्तव सुसम्भ्रमात्। भीमसेनं त गदया प्राहरत् कुरुसत्तम॥<br />Having warded off that blow, your son, that foremost one of Kuru's race, quickly struck Bhimasena with his weapon.</p>
<p id='35'>तस्य विस्यन्दमानेन रुधिरेणामितौजसः। प्रहारगुरुपाताच मूर्छव समजायत॥<br />A large quantity of blood being, drawn by that blow, as also owing to its violence, Bhimasena became stupefied.</p>
<p id='36'>दुर्योधनो न तं वेद पीडितं पाण्डवं रणे। धारयामास भीमोऽपि शरीरमतिपीडितम्॥<br />Duryodhana, however, could not perceive that Pandu's son was so afflicted at that moment. Though deeply afflicted, Bhima kept himself, summoning all his patience.</p>
<p id='37'>अमन्यत स्थितं ह्येनं प्रहरिष्यन्तमाहवे। अतो न प्राहरत् तस्मै पुनरेव तवात्मजः॥<br />Duryodhana, therefore, thought that he was all right and ready to return the blow. It was, therefore, that your son did not then strike him again.</p>
<p id='38'>ततो मुहूर्तमाश्वस्य दुर्योधनमुपस्थितम्। वेगेनाभ्यपद् राजन् भीमसेनः प्रतापवान्॥<br />Having taken rest for a little while, the brave Bhimasena rushed furiously, O king, at Duryodhana who was standing near.</p>
<p id='39'>तमापतन्तं सम्प्रेक्ष्य संरब्धममितौजसम्। मोघमस्य प्रहारं तं चिकीर्षुर्भरतर्षभ॥ अवस्थाने मतिं कृत्वा पुत्रस्तव महामनाः। इयेषोत्पतितुं राजञ्छलयिष्यन् वृकोदरम्॥<br />Seeing the energetic Bhimasena, filled with rage and rushing towards him your high-souled so, O Bharata's chief, desiring to thwart his blow, thought of showing the manoeuvre called Avasthana. He, therefore, desired to jump upwards, O king, king, for beguiling Vrikodara.</p>
<p id='40'>अबुद्ध्यद् भीमसेनस्तु राज्ञस्तस्य चिकीर्षितम्। अथास्य समभिद्रुत्य समुत्क्रुश्य च सिंहवत्॥ सृत्या वञ्चयतो राजन् पुनरेवोत्पतिष्यतः। ऊरुभ्यां प्राहिणोद् राजन् गदां वेगेन पाण्डवः॥<br />Bhimasena fully understood the object of his opponent. Rushing at him, with a loud leonine roar, he fiercely dropped his mace at the thighs of the Kuru king, as the latter had jumped up for making the first aim useless.</p>
<p id='41'>सा वज्रनिष्पेषसमा प्रहिता भीमकर्मणा। ऊरू दुर्योधनस्याथ बभञ्ज प्रियदर्शनौ॥<br />That mace, strong, like thunder and hurled by Bhima broke the two handsome thighs of Duryodhana.</p>
<p id='42'>स पपात नरव्याघ्रो वसुधामनुनादयन्। भग्नोरुर्भीमसेनेन पुत्रस्तव महीपते॥<br />That foremost of men, viz., your son after his thighs had been broken by Bhimasena, fell down resounding the Earth.</p>
<p id='43'>ववुर्वाताः सनिर्धाताः पांशुवर्षं पपात च। चचाल पृथिवी चापि सवृक्षापपर्वता॥<br />Fierce winds began to blow, with loud sounds, Showers of dust dropped. The Earth, with her trees and mountains, began to tremble.</p>
<p id='44'>तस्मिन् निपतिते वीरे पत्यौ सर्वमहीक्षिताम्। महास्वना पुनर्दीप्ता सनिर्घाता भयंकरी॥ पपात चोल्का महती पतिते पृथिवीपतौ।<br />Upon the fall of that hero who was the head of all kings, fierce and fiery winds blew with a loud noise and with thunder falling frequently. When that lord of Earth fell, large meteors dropped down from the welkin.</p>
<p id='45'>तथा शोणितवर्षं च पांशुवर्षं च भारत॥ ववर्ष मघवांस्तत्र तव पुत्रे निपातिते।<br />Bloody and dusty showers, fell, O Bharata! These were poured by Indra, upon the fall of your son.</p>
<p id='46'>यक्षाणां राक्षसानां च पिशाचानां तथैव च॥ अन्तरिक्षे महानादः श्रूयते भतरर्षभ।<br />A loud noise was heard, O Bharata's chief, in the sky, caused by the Yakshas, Rakshasas and the Pishachas.</p>
<p id='47'>तेन शब्देन घोरेण मृगाणामथ पक्षिणाम्॥ जज्ञे घोरतरः शब्दो बहूनां सर्वतोदिशम्।<br />At the terrible sound thousands of beasts and birds began to yell hideously on every side.</p>
<p id='48'>ये तत्र वाजिनः शेषा गजाश्च मनुजैः सह॥ मुमुचुस्ते महानादं तव पुत्रे निपातिते। भेरीशङ्खमृदङ्गानामभवच स्वनो महान्॥<br />Those horses, elephants and men, forming the remnant of the Pandava's army, urtered loud cried when your son fell. Loud blare of conchs and the peal of drums and cymbals were heard.</p>
<p id='49'>अन्तर्भूमिगतश्चैव तव पुत्रे निपातिते। बहुपादैर्बहुभुजैः कबन्धै?रदर्शनैः॥ नृत्यद्भिर्भयदैाप्ता दिशस्तत्राभवन् नृप।<br />A terrific noise seemed to come from the very bowels of the earth. Upon the fall of your son, O king, headless beings or dreadful appearance, possessed of many legs and many arms, and striking terror to all creatures, began to dance and cover the earth on all sides.</p>
<p id='50'>ध्वजवन्तोऽस्त्रवन्तश्च शस्त्रवन्तस्तथैव च॥ प्राकम्पन्त ततो राजंस्तव पुत्रे निपातिते।<br />Warriors, O king, who stood with standards or weapons in their arms, began to tremble, O king, when your son fell.</p>
<p id='51'>ह्रदाः कूपाश्च रुधिरमुढेमुपसत्तम॥ नद्यश्च सुमहावेगाः प्रतिस्रोतोवहाऽभवन्।<br />Lakes and wells, O best of kings, vomited forth blood. Swift coursing rivers flowed in opposite directions.</p>
<p id='52'>पुंल्लिङ्गा इव नार्यस्तु स्त्रीलिङ्गाः पुरुषाभवन्॥ दुर्योधने तदा राजन् पतिते तनये तव।<br />Women seemed to look like men, and men like women, when your son Duryodhana fell.</p>
<p id='53'>दृष्ट्वा तानद्भुतोत्पातान् पञ्चालाः पाण्डवैः सह॥ आविग्नमनसः सर्वे बभूवुर्भरतर्षभ।<br />Seeing those wonderful portents, Panchalas and the Pandavas, O Bharata's chief, were filled with anxiety.</p>
<p id='54'>ययुर्देवा यथाकामं गन्धर्वाप्सरसस्तथा॥ कथयन्तोऽद्भुतं युद्धं सुतयोस्तव भारत।<br />The gods and Gandharvas went away to their wished-for regions, taking and discoursing on that wonderful battle between your sons.</p>
<p id='55'>तथैव सिद्धा राजेन्द्र तथा वातिकचारणाः। नरसिंहौ प्रशंसन्तौ विप्रजग्मुर्यथागतम्॥<br />Similarly the Siddhas and the quickcoursing Charanas went to those places from which they had come, praising these two best of men. Inc</p>
