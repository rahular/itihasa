<h3>KARNA PARVA: Chapter 71</h3><h4>The vows of Arjuna</h4><p id='1'>संजय उवाच धर्मराजस्य तच्छ्रुत्वा प्रीतियुक्तं वचस्ततः। पार्थं प्रोवाच धर्मात्मा गोविन्दो यदुनन्दनः॥<br />Sanjaya said O majesty! Govinda, the religious soul and dignity of Yadu clan began explaining something to Arjuna in response to the vivid statement made by Dharamaraja (Yudhishthira).</p>
<p id='2'>इतिस्म कृष्णवचनात् प्रत्युचार्य युधिष्ठिरम्। भभूव विमनाः पार्थः किंचित् कृत्वेन पातकम्॥<br />Having addressed Yudhishthira in such an unbecoming manner and thus being guilty of an unrighteous conduct, Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, became disconsolate beyond measure.</p>
<p id='3'>ततोऽब्रवीद् वासुदेवः प्रहसन्निव पाण्डवम्। कथं नाम भवेदेतद् यदि त्वं पार्थ धर्मजम्॥ असिना तीक्ष्णधारेण हन्या धर्मे व्यवस्थितम्। त्वमित्युक्त्वाथ राजानमेवं कश्मलमाविशः॥<br />Vasudeva (then) in caustic tone addressing the son of Pandu said-"How, O Partha, would you have fared, had you mindful of (your) truthfulness, slain the son of Dharma with the keen edge of your steel. a</p>
<p id='4'>हत्वा तु नृपति पार्थ अकरिष्यः किमुत्तरम्। एवं हि दुर्विदो धर्मो मन्दप्रज्ञैर्विशेषतः॥<br />By simply 'you think the king you are affected so much-what, would you have done, O Partha, had you actually fulfilled your promise. The law of policy are indeed too subtle for comprehension, especially to those of weak intellect.</p>
<p id='5'>स भवान् धर्मभीरुत्वाद् ध्रुवमैष्यन्महत्तमः। नरकं घोररूपं च भ्रातुर्येष्ठस्य वै वधात्॥<br />For moral scruples you would surely have taken out the life of your eldest and would have thus committed a heinous sin and fallen into eternal perdition.</p>
<p id='6'>स त्वं धर्मभृतां श्रेष्ठं राजानं धर्मसंहितम्। प्रसादय कुरुश्रेष्ठमेतदत्र मतं मम॥<br />I adjure you, therefore, to assuage the sorrows of the pious king, the adored of the devout and the head of the Kurus.</p>
<p id='7'>प्रसाद्य भक्त्या राजानं प्रीते चैव युधिष्ठिर। प्रयावस्त्वरितौ योद्धं सूतपुत्ररथं प्रति॥<br />Let us pacify king Yudhishthira with due obeisance and when he is reconciled let both of us march against the chariot of the son of Suta and fight him out.es</p>
<p id='8'>हत्वा तु समरे कर्णं त्वमद्य निशितैः शरैः। विपुला प्रीतिमाधत्स्व धर्मपुत्रस्य मानद॥<br />O bestower of honors, secure the blessings of the son of Dharma, by shooting down Karna with the keen points of your arrows.</p>
<p id='9'>एतदत्र महाबाहो प्राप्तकालं मतं मम। एवं कृते कृतं चैव तव कार्यं भविष्यति॥<br />O mighty-aimed one, in my opinion this is the best course you could follow at present. By acting thus you will gain you ends."</p>
<p id='10'>ततोऽर्जुनो महाराज लज्जया वै समन्वितः। धर्मराजस्य चरणौ प्रपद्य शिरसा नतः॥ उवाच भरतश्रेष्ठं प्रसीदेति पुनः पुनः। क्षमस्व राजन् यत् प्रोक्तं धर्मकामेन भीरुणा॥<br />After this, O monarch, Arjuna became quite ashamed of himself; bending his head down he touched Yudhishthira's feet and repeatedly said unto that chief of the Bharatas, "O king, be appeased; forgive me for the impropriety of my language towards you; they were given expression to (as the only course left me) for maintaining truthfulness and avoiding sin.”</p>
<p id='11'>दृष्ट्वा तु पतितं पद्भ्यां धर्मराजो युधिष्ठिरः। धनंजयममित्रघ्नं रुदन्तं भरतर्षभ।॥ उत्थाय भ्रातरं राजा धर्मराजो धनंजयम्। समाश्लिष्य च सस्नेहं प्ररुरोद महीपतिः॥<br />O giant of the Bharata race, seeing Dhananjaya, the slayer of foes, thus fall at his feet with tears in his eyes, Yudhishthira, the lord of creation, the emblem of religion, rose up from his reclining position and with gushing eyes affectionately embraced him.</p>
<p id='12'>रुदित्वा सुचिरं कालं भ्रातरौ सुमहाद्युती। कृतशौचौ महाराज प्रीतिमन्तौ बभूवतुः॥<br />Having thus indulged themselves for some time and assuaged their grief the two brothers of bright effulgence became reconciled to each other and were once again cheerful.</p>
<p id='13'>तत अतिश्लिष्य तं प्रेम्णा मूर्ध्नि चाध्राय पाण्डवः। प्रीत्या परमया युक्तो विस्मयंञ्च पुनः पुनः॥ अब्रवीत् तं महेष्वासं धर्मराजे धनंजयम्।<br />Later on the son of Pandu, again giving Jaya a hug and taking the fragrance of his head, became supremely happy and praising his conduct, said-</p>
<p id='14'>कर्णेन मे महाबाहो सर्वसैन्यस्य पश्यतः॥ कवचं च ध्वजं चैव धनुः शक्तिर्हयाः शराः। शरैः कृत्ता महेष्वास यतमानस्य संयुगे॥<br />O mighty-wielder of bows, in spite of all my exertions in the battle-field, Karna with his shafts has, in the midst of the whole assembly, shattered my armours pinions, forces, arrows, bows and steeds.</p>
<p id='15'>सोऽहं ज्ञात्वा रणे तस्य कर्म दृष्ट्वा च फाल्गुन। व्यवसीदामि दुःखेन न च मे जीवितं प्रियम्॥<br />O Phalguna, thinking of this and witnessing his conduct in the battle, I have been sorely aggrieved. Life has no longer any charm for Ime.</p>
<p id='16'>न चेदद्य हि तं वीरं निहनिष्यसि संयुगे। प्राणानेव परित्यक्ष्ये जीवितार्थो हि को मम॥<br />If you do not overcome that indomitable hero in today's battle, then surely I will give up my life, what would be the use of bearing the burden of this body and carrying it on the earth any longer?</p>
<p id='17'>एवमुक्तः प्रत्युवाच विजयो भरतर्षभ। सत्येन ते शपे राजन् प्रसादेन तथैव च। भीमेन च नरश्रेष्ठ यमाभ्यां च महीपते॥ यथाद्य समरे कर्णं हनिष्यामि हतोऽपि वा। महीतले पतिष्यामि सत्येनायुधमालभे॥<br />O mighty scion of the Bharata race, upon hearing Yudhishthira thus express himself, Vijaya replied-"O foremost of kings, O lord of the earth, solemnly do I swear unto you that by your grace, by Bhima and the twins that this day either I shall slay Karna or myself kiss the earth being slain by him. I take this vow upon this weapon."</p>
<p id='18'>एवमाभाष्य राजानमब्रवीन्माधवं वचः। अद्य कर्णं रणे कृष्ण सूदयिष्ये न संशयः॥ तव बुद्ध्या हि भद्रं ते वधस्तस्य दुरात्मनः।<br />Having delivered himself thus to the king he addressed the following words to Madhava-“Verily, O Krishna, I will slay Karna in today's battle. May you be blessed for it is only through your tactics that the wretch could be slain.”</p>
<p id='19'>एवमुक्तोऽब्रवीत् पार्थ केशवो राजसत्तम॥ शक्तोऽसि भरतश्रेष्ठ हन्तुं कर्णं महाबलम्। एष चापि हि मे कामो नित्यमेव महारथ॥ कथं भवान् रणे कर्णं निहन्यादिति सत्तम।<br />O foremost of kings, upon Partha's uttering these words Keshava said unto him-"O mighty Bharata, you are well worthy of slaying Karna. Indeed, O best of men, O foremost of car-warriors, it has ever been upper most in my thoughts as to how you would succeed in slaying him.”</p>
<p id='20'>भूयश्चोवाच मतिमान् माधवो धर्मनन्दनम्॥ युधिष्ठिरेमं बीभत्सुं त्वं सान्त्वयितुमर्हसि। अनुज्ञातु च कर्णस्य वधायाद्य दुरात्मनः॥<br />Then the ever-intelligent Madhava once more turned towards the son of Dharma and said-“O Yudhishthira it is met that you would console Vibhatsu and order him to slay the wretched Karna today.</p>
<p id='21'>श्रुत्वा ह्यहमयं चैव त्वां कर्णशरपीडितम्। प्रवृत्ति ज्ञातुमायाताविहावां पाण्डुनन्दन॥<br />O son of Pandu, it is upon hearing that you were being afflicted with the arrows of Karna that we came to ascertain the plight you were in.</p>
<p id='22'>दिष्ट्यासि राजन् न हतो दिष्ट्या न ग्रहणं गतः। परिसान्त्वय बीभत्सुं जयमाशाधि चानघ॥<br />O king, it was very fortunate that you were not slain or captured. O holy one, do now console your Vibhatsu and bless him that he may attain victory."</p>
<p id='23'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच एह्येहि पार्थ बीभत्सो मां परिष्वज पाण्डव। वक्तव्यमुक्तोऽस्मि हितं त्वया क्षान्तं च तन्मया॥<br />Yudhishthira said Come O Partha, O Vibhatsu, come and embrace me; O son of Pandu, you have addressed me in words befitting the position and for my good and I have forgive you for their expressions.</p>
<p id='24'>अहं त्वामनुजानामि जहि कर्णं धनंजय। मन्युं च मा कृथाः पार्थ यन्मयोक्तोऽसि दारुणम्॥३१<br />O Dhananjaya you have my orders to go and slay Karna. Do not, O Partha, take offence with me for the vile expression I have made use of against you.</p>
<p id='25'>संजय उवाच ततो धनंजयो राजशिरसा प्रणतस्तदा। पादौ जग्राह पाणिभ्यां भ्रातुर्येष्ठस्य मारिष॥<br />Sanjaya continued O king, thereupon Dhananjaya bent his head low and with his hands took hold of the feet of his eldest brother.</p>
<p id='26'>तमुत्थाप्य ततो राजा परिष्वज्य च पीडितम्। मू[पाघ्राय चैवैनमिदं पुनरुवाच ह॥<br />The king them raising him clasped him to his bosom and smelling his head once more addressed him thus :</p>
<p id='27'>धनंजय महाबाहो मानितोऽस्मि दृढं त्वाय। माहात्म्यं विजयं चैव भूयः प्राप्नुहि शाश्वतम्॥<br />O Dhananjaya of mighty arms, I feel highly honoured by you, do you attain once more the greatness and victory you ever deserve.</p>
<p id='28'>अर्जुन उवाच अद्य तं पापकर्माण सानुबन्धं रणे शरैः। नयाम्यन्तं समासाद्य राधेयं बलगर्वितम्॥<br />Arjuna said Getting hold of that sinful son of Radha, who vaunts of his prowess, I shall in today's battle slay him along with his allies.</p>
<p id='29'>येत त्वं पीडितो बाणैदृढमायम्य कार्मुकम्। तस्याद्य कर्मणः कर्णः फलमाप्स्यति दारुणम्॥<br />Karna, who had afflicted you with his arrows shot from a full-drawn bow, would reap the dire effects of his act, this day.</p>
<p id='30'>अद्य त्वामनुपश्यति कर्ण हत्वा महीपते। सभाजयितुमाक्रन्दादिति सत्यं ब्रवीमि ते॥<br />O ruler of the earth, I assure you that I will slay Karna today in dreadful battle and come back to bring unto you the happy tidings walking all the while in your steps.</p>
<p id='31'>नाहत्वा विनिवर्तिष्ये कर्णमद्य रणाजिरात्। इति सत्येन ते पादौ स्पृशामि जगतीपते॥<br />O lord of the universe, I swear unto you by your feet that I shall not return from the terrible battle today without having slain Karna.</p>
<p id='32'>संजय उवाच इति ब्रुवाणं सुमनाः किरीटिनं युधिष्ठिरः प्राह वचो बृहत्तरम्। यशोऽक्षयं जीवितमाप्सितं ते जयं सदा वीर्यमरिक्षयं तदा॥<br />Sanjaya said As the diadem-decked Arjuna was speaking in this strain, Yudhishthira cheerfully addressed to him these graver words-“Do you ever attain unfading fame, eternal life, ready consummation of hopes, perpetual victory, ceaseless energy and continual success over your enemies!</p>
<p id='33'>प्रयाहि वृद्धिं च दिशन्तु देवता यथाहमिच्छामि तवास्तु तत् तथा। प्रयाहि शीघ्रं जहि कर्णमाहवे पुरंदरो वृत्रमिवात्मवृद्धये॥<br />May the gods grant you prosperity! May you realise all that I wish of you! At present go at once to the battle and kill Karna for selfelevation even as Purandara killed Vritra.</p>
