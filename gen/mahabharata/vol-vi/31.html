<h3>KARNA PARVA: Chapter 31</h3><h4>The parley between Karna and Duryodhana</h4><p id='1'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच स्वेनच्छन्देन नः सर्वानवधीद् व्यक्तमर्जुनः। न ह्यस्य समरे मुच्येदन्तकोऽप्याततायिनः॥<br />Dhritarashtra said It is told that Arjuna slaughtered all belonging to your side, according as he wished. Really even if the very Destroyer himself had come to battle, the could not escape Arjuna, when he took up arms against him.</p>
<p id='2'>पार्थश्चैकोऽहरद् भद्रामेकश्चाग्निमतर्पयत्। एकश्चमां महीं जित्वा चक्रे बलिभृतो नृपान्॥<br />Thereupon the son of Pritha, unassisted by anybody, ravished Vadra. And again, he, being solitary, gratified Agni. Then he, having subjugated this entire earth, compelled all the monarchs to pay him tribute.</p>
<p id='3'>एको निवातकवचानहनद् दिव्यकार्मुकः। एकः किरातरूपेण स्थितं शर्वमयोधयत्॥<br />Moreover he, being unassisted, slaughtered the whole force of the Nivatakavachas. And also having taken up his celestial bow and without any help from other hands, he (Arjuna) battled against the God, Mahadeva, who stayed before him in the guise of a hunter.</p>
<p id='4'>एको ह्यरक्षद् भरतानेको भवमतोषयत्। तेनैकेन जिताः सर्वे महीपा [ग्रतेजसा॥<br />Again, single-handed, he protected the entire race of the Bharatas; and similarly single-handed he gratified Vava. Also all the monarchs of the earth were defeated by him alone, who was possessed of fierce strength.</p>
<p id='5'>न ते निन्द्याः प्रशस्यास्ते यत्ते चक्रुर्ब्रवीहि तत्। ततो दुर्योधनः सूत पश्चात् किमकरोत् तदा॥<br />They, that is the Kuru warriors, are not to be blamed; rather they should be praised for the reason of their having fought with such a great warrior. Then, O Suta, what did Duryodhana do afterwards? O Sanjaya, do you relate to me all these in detail.</p>
<p id='6'>संजय उवाच दीनस्वरा दूयमाना हताहतविध्वस्ता विवर्मायुधवाहनाः। मानिनः शत्रुनिर्जिताः॥ शिबिरस्थाः पुनर्मन्त्रं मन्त्रयन्ति स्म कौरवाः। भग्नदंष्ट्रा हतिविषाः पादाक्रान्ता इवोरगाः॥<br />Sanjaya said The Kaurava warriors, who now resembled the serpents deprived of their fangs and poison and trodden over by the feet and some of whom were struck and wounded and some, again, were deprived of their armours, weapons and proper conveyances and some of whom were thrown down and who all, again, uttered very plaintive voices and who were scorched by the fire of grief and who merely made a parade of their knowledge in arms and who were all defeated by the antagonists and who now repaired to their encampment, had been counselling with one another.</p>
<p id='7'>तानब्रवीत् ततः कर्ण क्रुद्धः सर्प इव श्वसन्। करं करेण निष्पीड्य प्रेक्षमाणस्तवात्मजम्॥<br />Thereupon Karna, who was filled with wrath and who sighed heavily like a serpent and who squeezed his hands and who looked at</p>
<p id='8'>यत्तो दृढश्च दक्षश्च धृतिमानर्जुनस्तदा। सम्बोधयति चाप्येनं यथाकालमधोक्षजः॥<br />'The thing is that Arjuna is always very persevering, skillful and intelligent and again, when the first time (for any thing to be done) comes, the Eternal One (Vasudeva) awakes him to his duties.</p>
<p id='9'>सहसास्त्रविसर्गेण वयं तेनाद्य वञ्चिताः। श्वस्तवहं तस्य संकल्प सर्वं हन्ता महीपते॥<br />Today we were all deceived by him (Arjuna) by the shower of weapons poured forth all on a sudden. But tomorrow, O ruler of earth, I will baffle all his attempts.'</p>
<p id='10'>एवमुक्तस्तथेत्युक्त्वा सोऽनुजज्ञे नृपोत्तमान्। तेऽनुज्ञाता नृपा सर्वे स्वानि वेश्मानि भेजिरे॥<br />Having been thus addressed (by Karna) and saying-so be it, he (Duryodhana) commanded all the best of monarchs to dissolve. All these kings, being thus ordered, repaired to their respective abodes.</p>
<p id='11'>सुखोषितास्तां रजनीं हृष्टा युद्धाय निर्ययुः। तेऽपश्यन् विहितं व्यूहं धर्मराजेन दुर्जयम्॥ प्रयत्नात् कुरुमुख्येन बृहस्पत्युशनोमते।<br />Having passed that night most happily, the (those monarchs), with ample gratification, proceeded out for battle (the following morning). They then saw a very invincible array of army, that was constituted by the King of Justice (Yudhishthira), who was the greatest of the whole Kuru race, with the greatest care and quite in accordance with the advices of both Brihaspati and Ushanas.</p>
<p id='12'>अथ प्रतीपकर्तारं प्रवीरं परवीरहा॥ सस्मार वृषभस्कन्धं कर्णं दुर्योधनस्तदा।<br />Thereupon Duryodhana, that smiter of enemies, called to his memory, Karna, who baffled the attempts of the his antagonists and who was the foremost of all heroic warriors and who was the slayer of his foes and who had the neck like that of a bull.</p>
<p id='13'>पुरंदरसमं युद्धे मरुद्गणसमं बले॥ कार्तवीर्यसमं वीर्ये कर्ण राज्ञोऽगमन्मनः।<br />The king's (Duryodhana's) mind was now constantly directed towards Karna, who resembled Purandara in battle and who was like the Marutas in prowess and who also was equal to Kartavirya in prowess.</p>
<p id='14'>सर्वेषां चैवसैन्यानां कर्णमेवागमन्मनः। सूतपुत्रं महेष्वासं बन्धुमात्यकिकेष्विव॥<br />As also the hearts of all the troops turned towards Karna, who was the son of the charioteer and who, again was a great bowman, even as the heart of a person always turns towards his friends, whilst he falls in some great danger.</p>
<p id='15'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच ततो दुर्योधनः सूत पश्चात् किमकरोत्तदा। यद्धोऽगमन्मनो मन्दाः कर्णं वैकर्तनं प्रति॥ अप्यपश्यत राधेयं शीतात इव भास्करम्।<br />Dhritarashtra said Thus when the minds of all you were turned towards Karna the son of Vikartana, did the warriors on my side look at the son of Radha, even as persons, oppressed with cold, look at the sun?</p>
<p id='16'>कृतेऽवहारे सैन्यानां प्रवृत्ते च रणे पुनः॥ कथं वैकर्तनः कर्णस्तत्रायुध्यत संजय। कथं च पाण्डवाः सर्वे युयुधुस्तत्र सूतजम्॥<br />O Sanjaya, how did Karna, the son of Vikartana, fight there (in the field of battle), when my troops had first re-retreated and again engaged themselves in the battle. And how also did the sons of Pandu fight in the field with the son of Suta?</p>
<p id='17'>कर्णो ह्येको पहाबाहुर्हन्यात् पार्थान् सगुंजयान्। कर्णस्य भुजयोवीर्यं शक्रविष्णुसमं युधि॥ तस्य शस्त्राणि घोराणि विक्रमश्च महात्मनः। कर्णमाश्चित्य संग्रामे पत्तो दुर्योधनो नृपः॥<br />Indeed, Karna that mighty-armed warrior, would have slaughtered all the sons of Pritha along with the whole lot of the Srinjayas, although he was alone. In the field of battle, the strength of the arms of Karna was similar to the prowess of both Shakra and Vishnu; and the weapons, as well as the prowess of that loftyminded warrior were very fierce. Hoping to be under the protection of Karna, Karna, king Duryodhana was most eager for the battle.</p>
<p id='18'>दुर्योधन ततो दृष्ट्वा पाण्डवेन भृशार्दितम्। पराक्रान्तान् पाण्डुसुतान् दृष्ट्वा चापि महारथः॥<br />Then what did that very powerful carwarrior do after seeing Duryodhana very highly oppressed by the son of Pandu and also after witnessing all the sons of Pandu to display their prowess in arms?</p>
<p id='19'>कर्णमाश्चित्य संग्रामे मन्दो दुर्योधनः पुनः। जेतुमुत्सहते पार्थान् सपुत्रान् सहकेशवान्॥<br />Relying upon Karna, the foolish prince Duryodhana, again, aspired to defeat the sons, of Pritha along with their sons, as well as Keshava in the field of battle.</p>
<p id='20'>अहो बत महद् दुःखं यत्र पाण्डुसुतान् रणे। नातरद् रभसः कर्णो दैवं नूनं परायणम्॥<br />Alas! this is a matter of great grief that in the field of battle Karna, possessed of immense strength, could not defeat the sons of Pandu! It is certain that Destiny holds the foremost position in all affairs.</p>
<p id='21'>अहो द्यूतस्य निष्ठेयं घोरा सम्प्रति वर्तते। अहो तीव्राणि दुःखानि दुर्योधनकृतान्यहम्॥ सोढा घोराणि बहुशः शल्यभूतानि संजय।<br />Alas! the most dreadful result of gaming at dice has now been visible. O Sanjaya, I now hear of the greatest sorrows, that had been brought about by foolish, Duryodhana and also that resemble a large number of deadly arrows!</p>
<p id='22'>सौबलं च तदा तात नीतिमानिति मन्यते॥ कर्णश्च रभसो नित्यं राजा तं चाप्यनुव्रतः।<br />O Sire, the son of Subala was considered to be possessed of great policy; as also Karna was always extremely attached to the prince (Duryodhana).</p>
<p id='23'>यदेवं वर्तमानेषु महायुद्धेषु संजय॥ अश्रौषं निहतान् पुत्रान् नित्यदेव विनिर्जितान्। न पाण्डवानां समरे कश्चिदस्ति निवारकः॥ स्त्रीमध्यमिव गाहन्ते दैवं तु बलवत्तरम्।<br />O Sanjaya, when such is the matter with the battle which is most dreadful I have often heard that my sons were being constantly defeated and slaughtered. There exists no one who can restrain the Pandavas in the battle; and they enter into my whole force, even as one penetrates into the midst of a throng of women. I is sure that Destiny is the must supreme.</p>
<p id='24'>संजय उवाच राजन् पूर्वनिमित्तानि धर्मिष्ठानि विचिन्तय॥ अतिक्रान्तं हि यत् कार्य पश्चाचिन्तयते नरः। तचास्य न भवेत् कार्य चिन्तया च विनश्यति॥<br />Sanjaya said O monarch, do you now reflect upon your past actions, that were most righteous (the game at dice and others of the kind). Man afterwards reflects upon all actions that had past away. But that however, one should not do. For, one is destroyed by that sort of reflection.</p>
<p id='25'>तदिदं तव कार्यं तु दूरप्राप्तं विजानता। न कृतं यत् त्वया पूर्व प्राप्ताप्राप्तविचारणम्॥<br />That act of yours has been far from bringing out the desired end. Although you are possessed of knowledge, yet you did not consider before hand the propreity and impropriety of you actions.</p>
<p id='26'>उक्तोऽसि बहुधा राजन् मा युध्यस्वेति पाण्डवैः। गृह्णीषे न च तन्मोहाद् वचनं च विशाम्पते॥<br />O monarch, it was several times told to you, that you should not fight with the, Pandavas. But, O ruler of earth, that advice you did not accept out of foolishness.</p>
<p id='27'>त्वया पापानि घोराणि समाचीर्णानि पाण्डुषु। त्वकृते वर्तते घोर: पार्थिवानां जनक्षयः॥<br />The most horrible deeds of sin had been perpetrated by you in respect to the Pandavas. And only for those acts of yours that this terrible destruction of kings takes place now.</p>
<p id='28'>तत्त्विदानीमतिक्रान्तं मा शुचो भरतर्षभ। शृणु सर्वं यथावृत्तं घोरं वैशसमुच्यते॥<br />O foremost of the Bharata race all has now passed away, do not grieve for them. O you of evenlasting fame, do you now hear of all that had taken place, namely the details of that awful slaughter.</p>
<p id='29'>प्रभातायां रजन्यां तु कर्णो राजानमभ्ययात्। समेत्य च महाबाहुदुर्योधनमथाब्रवीत्॥<br />Thus when the night dawned, Karna went of the king. And having approached him that hero of very powerful arms then addressed Duryodhana.</p>
<p id='30'>कर्ण उवाच अद्य राजन् समेष्यामि पाण्डवेन यशस्विना। निहनिष्यामि तं वीरं स वा मां निहनिष्यति॥<br />Karna said Today, O monarch, I will go forth for battle with the famous son of Pandu. Either I shall slay that hero or he will slay me.</p>
<p id='31'>बहुत्वान्मम कार्याणां तथा पार्थस्य भारत। नाभूत् समागमो राजन् मम चैवार्जुनस्य च॥<br />O descendant of the Bharata race, O monarch, on account of the innumerable acts of both myself as well as of the son, O Pritha, that this encounter between me and Arjuna had taken place; else this would not have occurred.</p>
<p id='32'>इदं तु मे यथा प्राज्ञं शृणु वाक्यं विशाम्पते। अनिहत्य रणे पार्थं नाहमेष्यामि भारत॥<br />O ruler of earth, do you listen to my speech, uttered in accordance with my wisdom. O descendant of the Bharata race, if I cannot slay the son of Pritha in battle, I will not return from the field.</p>
<p id='33'>हतप्रवीरै सैन्येऽस्मिन् मयि चावस्थिते युधि। अभियास्यति मां पार्थं शक्रशक्तिविनाकृतम्॥<br />For the reason of this army on over said having had the best of its warriors all slaughtered, that I will myself stand in the field-the son of Pritha will proceed against me, who am deprived of the Sakti-arrow given to me by Shakra (Indra).</p>
<p id='34'>ततः श्रेयस्करं यच्च तन्निबोध जनेश्वर। आयुधानां च मे वीर्यं दिव्यानामर्जुनस्य च॥<br />O lord of men, then be you conscious of what proves beneficial to you. The strength of my celestial weapons is similar to the strength of Arjuna's weapons.</p>
<p id='35'>कायस्य महतो भेदे लाघवे दूरपातने। सौष्ठवे चास्त्रपाते च सव्यसाची न मत्समः॥<br />As regards the baffling of attempts of the most powerful antagonists and as to the highness of arms and the range of arrows shot and in respect to skillfulness, as also in the management of weapons, Suvyasachin is never my peer.</p>
<p id='36'>प्राणे शौर्येऽथ विज्ञाने विक्रमे चापि भारत। निमित्तज्ञानयोगे च सव्यसाची न मत्समः॥<br />Again, O descendant of the Bharata race, either in physical strength, or in heroism, or knowledge (in the management or arms), or in prowess or in hitting the mark Savyasachin is never my peer.</p>
<p id='37'>सर्वायुधमहामानं विजयं नाम तद्धनुः। इन्द्रार्थं प्रियकामेन निर्मितं विश्वकर्मणा॥<br />My bow, that was known by the name of Vijaya, was the most supreme of all weapons. It was made by Vishvakarman with the object of performing what was agreeable to Indra.</p>
<p id='38'>येन दैत्यगणान् राजञ्जितवान् वै शतक्रतुः। यस्य घोषेण दैत्यानां व्यामुह्यन्तः दिशो दशः॥<br />O monarch, Shatakratu (Indra), indeed, subdued all the Daityas by means of that bow and again, at the twang of that bow, the whole body of the Dailyas supposed the ten points of the compass to be empty.</p>
<p id='39'>तद् भार्गवाय प्रायच्छच्छकः परमसम्मतम्। तद् दिव्य भार्गवो मह्यमददद् धनुरुत्तमम्॥<br />And formerly Shakra (Indra) gave away to the son of Bhrigu that excellently equipt and best of the celestial bows, which was highly respected by all; and afterwards the son of Bhrigu gave it to me.</p>
<p id='40'>तेन योत्स्ये महाबाहुमर्जुनं जयतां वरम्। यथेन्द्रं समरे सर्वान् दैतेयान् वै समागतान्॥<br />I will battle with that foremost one amongst the victorious warriors, the mighty-armed Arjuna, in the field; even as Indra fought with all the Daityas, who had assembled against him.</p>
<p id='41'>धनुर्घोरं रामदत्तं गाण्डीवात् तद् विशिष्यते। त्रिस्सप्तकृत्वः पृथिवी धनुषा येन निर्जिता॥<br />That fierce bow, given away by Rama, is in every way superior to the Gandiva bow; with that bow the entire earth was conquered twenty-one times (by Bhargava).</p>
<p id='42'>धनुषो ह्यस्य कर्माणि दिव्यानि प्राह भार्गवः। तद् रामो ह्यददन्मह्यं तेन योत्स्यामि पाण्डवम्॥४७<br />The son of Bhrigu speaks of the celestial deeds of that formidable bow. As Rama has given it to me I will surely fight with the son of Pandu with that bow.</p>
<p id='43'>अद्य दुर्योधन त्वां नन्दयिष्ये सबान्धवम्। निहत्य समरे वीरमर्जुनं जयतां वरम्॥<br />Today, O Duryodhana, I will gratify your heart, along with that of your friends by slaughter in the field of battle the heroic Arjuna that foremost one amongst the victorious warriors.</p>
<p id='44'>सपर्वतवनद्वीपा हतवीरा ससागरा। पुत्रपौत्रप्रतिष्ठा ते भविष्यत्यद्य पार्थिव॥<br />O lord of earth, the whole kingdom of earth, along with the oceans, the mountains, the forests and the islands, with all her heroes slaughtered, will be your own; and over which you will be established with your sons and grandsons.</p>
<p id='45'>नाशक्यं विद्यते मेऽद्य त्वत्प्रियार्थं विशेषतः। सम्यग्धर्मानुरक्तस्य सिद्धिरात्मवतो यथा॥<br />There exists nothing that I cannot perform today, especially for gratifying you; even as success (ascetic) does surely exist in respect to a person, who is passionately attached to virtue and who also has controlled his soul.</p>
<p id='46'>न हि मां समरे सोढुं संशक्तोऽग्नि तसर्यथा। अवश्यं तु मया वाच्यं येन हीनोऽस्मि फाल्गुनात्।।५१<br />There is no one, who, coming in contact with me, is able to bear me in the battle; even as the tree, coming in contact with the fire, is able to bear it. Indeed this must be told by me that is what respect with the fire, is able to bear it. Indeed this must be told by me that in what respect I am inferior to Phalguna (Arjuna).</p>
<p id='47'>ज्या तस्य धनुषो दिव्या तथाक्षय्ये महेषुधी। सारथिस्तस्य गोविन्दो मम तादृङ् न विद्यते॥<br />The string of his bow is celestial as also he (Arjuna) has got two inexhaustible quivers. His charioteer is Govinda. But I have got nothing like all these.</p>
<p id='48'>तस्य दिव्यं धनुः श्रेष्ठं गाण्डीवमजितं युधि। विजयं च महद्दिव्यं ममापि धनुरुत्तमम्॥<br />His Gandiva bow is celestial and one of the best; as also it is indestructible in battle, whereas my bow, called Vijaya, is also divine and formidable, as it is also the foremost of its kind.</p>
<p id='49'>तत्राहमधिकः पार्थाद् धनुषा तेन पार्थिवा येन चाप्यधिको वीरः पाण्डवस्तन्निबोध मे॥<br />Thus, O monarch, as regards the bow I am superior to the son of Pritha. But in what respect the son of Pandu (Arjuna), that heroic one, is superior to me, do you now listen to.</p>
<p id='50'>रश्मिग्राहश्च दाशार्हः सर्वलोकनमस्कृतः। अग्निदत्तश्च वै दिव्यो रथः काञ्चनभूषणः॥<br />That one, born in the Dasharha race, is the holder of the reins (of his horses), who is revered by all people; as also his car, that is ornamented with gold, is celestial and the gift of Agni (the god of fire).</p>
<p id='51'>अच्छेद्यः सर्वतो वीर वाजिनश्च मनोजवाः। ध्वजच दिव्यो द्युतिमान् वानरो विस्मयंकरः॥<br />That hero is impenetrable in all his parts. His horses are possessed of the speed of the mind. His standard is also celestial, the most resplendent, bearing an Ape exciting the greatest wonder.</p>
<p id='52'>कृष्णाश्च स्रष्टा जगतो रथं तमभिरक्षति। एतैर्द्रव्यैरहं हीनो योद्धुमिच्छामि पाण्डवम्॥<br />Moreover Krishna, who is the creator of the universe, most carefully guards that car. I am destitute of all these equipments, yet I wish to fight with the son of Pandu.</p>
<p id='53'>अयं तु सदृशः शौरेः शल्यः समितिशोभन:। सारथ्यं यदि मे कुर्याद् ध्रुवस्ते विजयो भवेत्॥<br />Indeed, this Shalya, who is the creator of the assemblies, resembles Shauri. Should be perform the duties of my charioteer, the victory will surely by yours.</p>
<p id='54'>तस्य मे सारथिः शल्यो भवत्वसुकरः परैः। नाराचान् गार्धपत्रांश्च शकटानि वहन्तु मे॥<br />Let Shalya, therefore, who is irresistible by the antagonists, act as my charioteer. And let the carts also convey my long shafts, as well as the arrows furnished with the feathers of vultures.</p>
<p id='55'>रथाश्च मुख्या राजेन्द्र युक्ता वाजिभिरुत्तमैः। आयान्तु पश्चात् सततं मामेव भरतर्षभ॥<br />Let, O lord of kings, the best of horses by yoked to my excellent cars; and let them, O foremost of the Bharata race, follow me without exhaustion.</p>
<p id='56'>एवमभ्यधिकः पार्थाद् भविष्यामि गुणैरहम्। शल्योऽप्यभ्यधिकः कृष्णादर्जुनादपि चाप्यहम्॥<br />Thus I will be superior to the son of Pritha in respect to these (the above mentioned) qualities. And thus, again, A Shalya is superior to Krishna; and I am superior to Arjuna.</p>
<p id='57'>यथाश्चहृदयं वेद दाशार्हः परवीरहा। तथा शल्यो विजानीते हयज्ञानं महारथः॥<br />Even as that one, of the Dasharha race, who is the slayer of the hostile neroes, is thoroughly versed in knowledge about horses, so Shalya, that most powerful car-warriors, is also acquainted with the science of horses.</p>
<p id='58'>बाहुवीर्यं समो नास्ति मद्रराजस्य कश्चन। तथाऽस्त्रे मत्समो नास्ति कश्चिदेव धनुर्धरः॥<br />In respect of the strength of arms there exist none who is equal to the prince of Madras.</p>
<p id='59'>तथा शल्यसमो नास्ति हयज्ञाने हि कश्चन। सोऽयमभ्यधिकः कृष्णाद् भविष्यति रथो मम॥<br />Even as there exists not a single bowman, who is peer in respect to the management of arms, so there is no one, who resembles Shalya as to the knowledge of horses.</p>
<p id='60'>एवं कुते रथस्थोऽहं गुणैरभ्यधिकोऽर्जुनात्। भवे युधि जयेयं च फाल्गुनं कुरुसत्तम।॥<br />Thus my car, which is attended with all these surroundings, will indeed, be superior to that of the son of Pritha. Even the very celestials, accompanied by Vasava, will not be capable of proceeding against it (my car).</p>
<p id='61'>समुद्यातुं न शक्ष्यन्ति देवा अपि सवासवाः। एतत् कृतं महाराज त्वयेच्छामि परंतप॥<br />Thus having performed all these, when I take my stand upon the car, I should surely be superior to Arjuna in respect of these (the above mentioned) qualities, and also I should, O foremost of the Kuru race, subdue Phalguna.</p>
<p id='62'>क्रियतामेष कामो मे मा वः कालोऽत्यगादयम्। एवं कृते कृतं सह्यं सर्वकामैर्भविष्यति॥<br />O mighty, O searcher of enemies, I desire that all this should be done by you. Also this my desire should be fulfilled by you; and the time in doing it should not pass away for nothing.</p>
<p id='63'>ततो द्रक्ष्यसि संग्रामे यत् करिष्यामि भारत। सर्वथा पाण्डवान् संख्ये विजेष्ये वै समागतान्॥<br />Having performed all this, there will be enough help to me on all desirable points. Thereupon, O descendant of the Bharata race, you will witness whatever I will achieve in the field of battle. By all means I will subdue all the assembled Pandavas in the field of battle.</p>
<p id='64'>न हि मे समरे शक्ताः समुद्यातुं सुरासुराः। किमु पाण्डुसुता राजन् रणे मानुषयोनयः॥<br />Even the very celestials and the Asuras will not be able to proceed against me in the field. O monarch, what should I say of the sons of Pandu, who are of human origin and who will not be capable of withstanding me in the battle.</p>
<p id='65'>संजय उवाच एवमुक्तस्तव सुतः कर्णेनाहवशोभिना। सम्पूज्य सम्प्रहृष्टात्मा ततो राधेयमब्रवीत्॥<br />Sanjaya said Thereupon your son, having been thus addressed by Karna, who was the ornament of battle and also having adore the son of Radha, told him these words with a highly gratified heart.</p>
<p id='66'>दुर्योधन उवाच एवमेतत् करिष्यामि यथा त्वं कर्ण मन्यसे। सोपासङ्गा रथाः साश्वाः स्वनुयास्यन्ति संयुगे॥<br />Duryodhana said I will perform all this, that you, O Karna, desire. Numerous cars, furnished with the excellent quivers and yoked to the foremost of horses, will follow you in the field of battle.</p>
<p id='67'>नाराचान् गार्धपत्रांश्च शकटानि वहन्तु ते। अनुयास्याम कर्ण त्वां सर्वे च पार्थिवाः॥<br />And let the long shafts and the arrows furnished with the wings of vultures, be conveyed to you in innumerable carts; and O Karna, all of us, namely the princes, wi follow you into the field.</p>
<p id='68'>संजय उवाच एवमुक्त्वा महाराज तव पुत्रः प्रतापवान्। अभिगम्याब्रवीद् राजा मद्रराजमिदं वचः॥<br />Sanjaya said O mighty monarch, your son, who is possessed of immense prowess, after having thus addressed and also having advanced before the prince of Madras, spoke these words to that chief, O monarch.</p>
