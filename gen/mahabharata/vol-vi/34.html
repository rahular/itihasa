From this I am of opinion that the amount of energy and strength possessed by them, is twice the energy and prowess possessed by us.</p>

O sire, the celestials, after having seen that the energies of the entire universe were united together in one place, informed that high-souled one (Brahman) that the car was ready.</p>
<p id='37'>एवं तस्मिन् महाराज कल्पिते रथसत्तमे। देवैर्मनुजशार्दूल द्विषतामभिमर्दने॥ स्वान्यायुधानि मुख्यानि न्यदधाच्छङ्करो रथे। ध्वजयष्टिं वियत् कृत्वा स्थापयामास गोवृषम्॥<br />O great monarch, O foremost of persons, when that best of cars was thus prepared by all the celestials with a view to crush down their antagonists (the Danavas).
