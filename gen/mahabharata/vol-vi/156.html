<h3>Gadayuddha Parva: Chapter 6O</h3><h4>The anger of Rama at seeing the unfair fight. Krishna pacifies him</h4><p id='1'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच अधर्मेण हतं दृष्ट्वा राजानं माधवोत्तमः। किमब्रवीत् तदा सूत बलदेवो महाबलः॥<br />Dhritarashtra said “Seeing the (Kuru) king struck dawn unfairly, what, O charioteer did the powerful Baladeva, that Madhu's chief, say.</p>
<p id='2'>गदायुद्धविशेषज्ञो गदायुद्धविशारदः। कृतवान् रौहिणेयो यत् तन्ममाचक्ष्व संजय॥<br />“Tell me, O Sanjaya, what Rohini's son, well-skilled in mace encounters and well acquainted with all its rules did on that occasion!"</p>
<p id='3'>संजय उवाच शिरस्यभिहतं दृष्ट्वा भीमसेनेन ते सुतम्। रामः प्रहरतां श्रेष्ठश्चक्रोध बलवद्वली॥<br />Sanjaya said "Secing your son struck at the thighs, the powerful Rama, that best of smiters, became highly angry.</p>
<p id='4'>ततो मध्ये नरेन्द्राणामूर्ध्वबाहुर्हलायुधः। कुर्वन्नार्तस्वरं घोरं धिग् भीमेत्युवाच ह॥<br />Raising his arms up, the hero having the plough for his weapon, sorrowfully said in the midst of those kings-'Oh, fie on Bhima, fie on Bhima.</p>
<p id='5'>अहो धिग् यदधो नाभेः प्रहृतं धर्मविग्रहे। नैतद् दृष्टं गदायुद्धे कृतवान् यद् वृकोदरः॥<br />Oh, fie, that in such a fair fight a blow has been inflicted below the navel! Never before has such an act, as has been done by Vrikodara, been seen in an encounter with the mace!</p>
<p id='6'>अधो नाभ्यां न हन्तव्यमिति शास्त्रस्य निश्चयः। अयं त्वशास्त्रविन्मूढः स्वच्छन्दात् सम्प्रवर्तते॥<br />No limb below the navel should be struck. This is the rule laid down in treatises! Bhima, however, is an ignorant wretch, unacquainted with the code of war! He, therefore, acted as he likes.'</p>
<p id='7'>तस्य तत्तद् ब्रुवाणस्य रोषः समभवन्महान्। ततो राजानमालोक्य रोषसंरक्तलोचनः॥ बलदेवो महाराज ततो वचनमब्रवीत्।<br />Uttering these words, Rama became very angry. Seeing on Duryodhana he became with reddened eyed and said these words:</p>
<p id='8'>न चैष पतितः कृष्ण केवलं मत्समोऽसमः॥ आश्रित्य तु दौर्बल्यादाश्रयः परिभर्यते। ततो लागलमुद्यम्य भीममभ्यद्रवद् बली॥<br />(Baladeva then replied-) O Sri Krishna! King Duryodhana was mighty not any way less than me. Nobody here was able to face him in war with mace. Fall of Duryodhana unjust way or by tactics has humiliated me also, the shelterer is being condemned/insulted owing to defects in the person sheltered.</p>
<p id='9'>तमुत्पतन्तं जग्राह केशवो विनयान्वितः। बाहुभ्यां पीनवृत्ताभ्यां प्रयत्नाद् बलवद्वली॥<br />The powerful Keshava, however, ever bending with humility, caught the rushing Rama, with his massive and well-formed arms.</p>
<p id='10'>सितासितौ यदुवरौ शुशुभातेऽधिकं तदा। नभोगतौ यथा राजश्चन्द्रसूर्यो दिनक्षये॥ तस्योर्ध्वबाहोः सदृशं रूपमासीन्महात्मनः। बहुधातुविचित्रस्य श्वेतस्येव महागिरेः॥<br />Those two Yadu heroes, the one dark in complexion and the other fair, shone exceedingly beautiful at that moment, like the Sun and the Moon, The great warrior with uplifted arms appeared like the huge mountain of Kailasa variegated with various kinds of metals.</p>
<p id='11'>उवाच चैनं संरब्धं शमयन्निव केशवः। आत्मवृद्धिर्मित्रवृद्धिर्मित्रमित्रोदयस्तथा॥ विपरीतं द्विषत्स्वेतत् षड्विधा वृद्धिरात्मनः। आत्मन्यपि च मित्रे च विपरीतं यदा भवेत्॥<br />For pacifying the angry Rama, Keshava addressed him, saying, "There are six sorts of advancement that a person may scek, viz., one's own advancement, the advancement of one's friends' the destruction of one enemy, the destruction of one's enemy's friends, and the destruction of one's enemy's friends' friends.</p>
<p id='12'>तदा विद्यान्मनोग्लानिमाशु शान्तिकरो भवेत्। अस्माकं सहजं मित्रं पाण्डवाः शुद्धपौरुषाः॥<br />When misfortunes befall one's own self or one's friends, it is a sign that one's fall is near, and, therefore, one should at such times seek for the remedy.</p>
<p id='13'>स्वकाः पितृष्वसुः पुत्रास्ते परैनिकृता भृशम्। प्रतिज्ञापालनं धर्मः क्षत्रियस्येह वेम्यहम्॥<br />The Pandavas are our natural friends. They are the children of our own father's sister! They had been greatly assailed by their enemies.</p>
<p id='14'>सुयोधनस्य गदया भक्ताम्यूरू महाहवे। इति पूर्वं प्रतिज्ञातं भीमेन हि सभातले॥<br />The fulfillment of one's promise is one's duty. Formerly Bhima had promised in the midst of the assembly that he would in great battle break with his mace the thighs of Duryodhana.</p>
<p id='15'>मैत्रैयेणाभिशप्तश्च पूर्वमेव महर्षिणा। ऊरू ते भेत्स्यते भीमो गदयेति परंतप॥<br />The great Rishi Maitreya also had formerly imprecated Duryodhana, saying, Bhima will, with his mace, break your thighs.</p>
<p id='16'>अतो दोषं न पश्यामि मा क्रुद्ध्यस्व प्रलम्बहन्। यौनः स्वैः सुखहादैच सम्बन्धः सह पाण्डवैः॥<br />For all this, I do not see any fault in Bhima! Do not yield to anger, O slayer of Pralamba! Our relationship with the Pandavas is based on birth, blood and love.</p>
<p id='17'>तेषां वृद्ध्यां हि वृद्धिों मा क्रुधः पुरुषर्षभ। वासुदेववचः श्रुत्वा सीरभृत् प्राह धर्मवित्॥ धर्मः सुचरितः सद्भिः स च द्वाभ्यां नियच्छति। अर्थश्चात्यर्थलुब्धस्य कामश्चातिप्रसङ्गिणः॥<br />On their advancement depends our own. Do not, therefore, give away to anger, O foremost of men!'-Hearing these words of Vasudeva the wielder of the plough, who was well read in the Ethical lore, said, 'Morality is always followed by the good. Morality is always followed by two motives, viz., the desire for Profit cherished by those that follow it, or the desire for Pleasure.</p>
<p id='18'>धर्मार्थो धर्मकामौ च कामार्थो चाप्यपीडयन्। धर्मार्थकामान् योऽभ्येति सोऽत्यन्तं सुखमश्नुते॥<br />Whoever, without making distinction between Morality and Profit, or Morality and Pleasure, or Pleasure and Profit, follows all three, viz., Morality, Profit and Pleasure, always succeeds in obtaining great happiness.</p>
<p id='19'>तदिदं व्याकुलं सर्वं कृतं धर्मस्य पीडनात्। भीमसेने न गोविन्द कामं तु यथाऽऽत्य माम्॥<br />It is because Bhimasena, has deviated from morality this harmony, of which I have spoken, has been disturbed, Inspite, O Govinda, of all your arguments to me!'</p>
<p id='20'>श्रीकृष्ण उवाच अरोषणो हि धर्मात्मा सततं धर्मवत्सलः। भवान् प्रख्यायते लोके तस्मात् संशाम्य मा क्रुधः॥२४<br />Krishna replied, saying-You are always described as shorn of wrath, and devoted to righteousness! Pacify yourself, therefore, and do not yield to wrath!</p>
<p id='21'>प्राप्तं कलियुगं विद्धि प्रतिज्ञां पाण्डवस्य च। आनृण्यं यातु वैरस्य प्रतिज्ञायाश्च पाण्डवः॥<br />Know that the Kali age is at hand. Remember also the promise made by the son of Pandu! Let, therefore, the son of Pandu be regarded to have requited the debt he owed to his enemy and to have carried out his promise."</p>
<p id='22'>संजय उवाच धर्मच्छलमपि श्रुत्वा केशवात् स विशाम्पते। नैव प्रीतमना रामो वचनं प्राह संसदि॥ हत्वाऽधर्मेण राजानं धर्मात्मानं सुयोधनम्। जिह्मयोधीते लोकेऽस्मिन् ख्याति यास्यति पाण्डवः॥<br />Sanjaya continued "Hearing this fallacious argument from Keshava, O king, Rama failed to remove his anger and become cheerful. He then said in that assembly, having unfairly killed the righteous king Suyodhana, the son of Pandu shall be known in the world as a wily warrior.</p>
<p id='23'>दुर्योधनोऽपि धर्मात्मा गतिं यास्यति शाश्वतीम्। ऋजुयोधी हतो राजा धार्तराष्ट्रो नराधिपः॥<br />The righteous Duryodhana, on the other hand, shall acquire cternal blessedness! Dhritarashtra's royal son, who has been struck down, is a fair warrior!</p>
<p id='24'>युद्धदीक्षां प्रविश्याजौ रणयज्ञं वितत्य च। हुत्वाऽऽत्मानममित्राग्नौ प्राप चावभृथं यशः॥<br />Having made all possible arrangements for the Sacrifice of battle, and having performed the initiatory rites on the field, and lastly, having poured his life as a libation upon the fire of foes, Duryodhana had duly completed his Sacrifice by the final ablutions of glory!"</p>
<p id='25'>इत्युक्त्वा रथमास्थाय रौहिणेयः प्रतापवान्। श्वेताभ्रशिखराकारः प्रययौ द्वारकां प्रति॥<br />Having said these words, the brave son of Rohini, looking like a white cloud, got upon his chariot and went towards Dwaraka.</p>
<p id='26'>पञ्चालाश्च सवार्ष्णेयाः पाण्डवाश्च विशाम्पते। रामे द्वारावतीं याते नातिप्रमनसोऽभवन्॥<br />The Panchalas, the Vrishnis and the Pandavas. O king, became rather dispirited after Rama had started for Dvaravati.</p>
<p id='27'>ततो युधिष्ठिरं दीनं चिन्तापरमधोमुखम्। शोकोपहतसंकल्पं वासुदेवोऽब्रवीदिदम्॥<br />Then approaching Yudhishthira, who was exceedingly melancholy and anxious, and who hung down his head and knew not what to do in the great affliction of his heart, Vasudeva, said to him these words.</p>
<p id='28'>वासुदेव उवाच धर्मराज किमर्थं त्वमधर्ममनुमन्यसे। हतबन्धोर्यदेतस्य पतितस्य विचेतसः॥ दुर्योधनस्य भीमेन मृद्यमानं शिरः पदा। उपप्रेक्षसि कस्मात् त्वं धर्मज्ञः सन्नराधिप।॥<br />Vasudeva said O Yudhishthira why do you allow such a wrong act, since you suffer the head of the insensible and fallen Duryodhana whose relatives and friends have all been killed to be thus struck by Bhima with his foot? conversant as thou art with the rules of Ethics, why do you, O king, look at this act with indifference?'</p>
<p id='29'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच न ममैतत् प्रियं कृष्ण यद् राजानं वृकोदरः। पदा मूर्ध्यस्पृशत् क्रोधान्न हृष्ये कुलक्षये॥<br />Yudhishthira answered This act, O Krishna, of Vrikodara's angrily touching the head of the king with his foot, is not pleasant to me, nor am I glad at this extermination of my race!</p>
<p id='30'>निकृत्या निकृता नित्यं धृतराष्ट्रसुतैर्वयम्। बहूनि परुषाण्युक्त्वा वनं प्रस्थापिताः स्म ह॥<br />By gujle were we always imposed on by the sons of Dhritarastra! They spoke many harsh words to us. We were again exiled into the forest by them.</p>
<p id='31'>भीमसेनस्य तद् दुःखमतीव हदि वर्तते। इति संचिन्त्य वार्ष्णेय मयैतत् समुपेक्षितम्॥<br />On account of all those acts great grief exists in Bhimasena's heart! Thinking of all this, O hero of the Vrishnis's race, I looked on with indifference!</p>
<p id='32'>तस्माद्धत्वाऽकृतप्रज्ञं लुब्धं कामवशानुगम्। लभतां पाण्डवः कामं धर्मेऽधर्मे च वा कृते॥<br />Having killed the covetous, foolish and passionate Duryodhana, let the son of Pandu satisfy his desire, be it by means fair or foul.</p>
<p id='33'>संजय उवाच इत्युक्ते धर्मराजेन वासुदेवोऽब्रवीदिदम्। काममस्त्वेतदिति वै कृच्छ्राद् यदुकुलोद्वहः॥ इत्युक्तो वासुदेवेन भीमप्रियहितैषिणा। अन्वमोदत तत् सर्वं यद् भीमेन कृतं युधि॥ भीमसेनोऽपि हत्वाऽऽजौ तव पुत्रममर्षणः। अभिवाद्याग्रतः स्थित्वा सम्प्रहृष्टः कृताञ्जलिः॥<br />Sanjaya continued After Yudhishthira had said this, Vasudeva, said with difficulty-Let it be so! After Vasudeva had been addressed in those words by Yudhishthira, the former, who, always wished what was pleasant to, and beneficial for, Bhima, insooth, approved all those acts that Bhima had done in battle. Having struck down your son in battle, the wrathful Bhimasena, his heart overflowing with joy, stood with joined hands before Yudhishthira and saluted him duly.</p>
<p id='34'>प्रोवाच सुमहातेजा धर्मराज युधिष्ठिरम्। हर्षादुत्फुल्लनयनो जितकाशी विशाम्पते॥ तवाद्य पृथिवी सर्वा क्षेमा निहतकण्टका। तां प्रशाधि महाराज स्वधर्ममनुपालय॥<br />With eyes expanded in joy and proud of the victory he had acquired, the energetic Vrikodara, O king, said to his eldest brother, saying-'The Earth belongs to-day to you, O king, without quarrels to disturb her and with all her thorns gone! Govern her, O king, and observe the duties of your order.</p>
<p id='35'>यस्तु कर्ताऽस्य वैरस्य निकृत्या निकृतिप्रियः। सोऽयं विनिहतः शेते पृथिव्यां पृथिवीपते॥<br />He, who was the root of these hostilities, and who fomented them by means of his wiliness, that wretched being, lies struck down, on the bare ground, O lord of Earth.</p>
<p id='36'>दुःशासनप्रभृतयः सर्वे ते चोग्रवादिनः। राधेयः शकुनिश्चैव हताश्च तव शत्रवः॥<br />All those wretched led by Dusshasana, who used to utter cruel words, as also those other enemies of yours, viz., the son of Radha, and Shakuni, have been killed.</p>
<p id='37'>सेयं रत्नसमाकीर्णा मही सवनपर्वता। उपावृत्ता महाराज त्वामद्य निहतद्विषम्॥<br />Filled with all sorts of gems, the Earth, with her forests and mountains, O king, once more approaches you who have no foes alive.'</p>
<p id='38'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच गतो वैरस्य निधनं हतो राजा सुयोधनः। कृष्णस्य मतमास्थाय विजितेयं वसुन्धरा॥<br />Yudhishthira said Hostilities have been closed! King Suyodhana has been struck down! The Earth has been conquered (by us), under the advice of Krishna.</p>
<p id='39'>दिष्ट्या गतस्त्वमानृण्यं मातु: कोपस्य चोभयोः। दिष्ट्या जयति दुर्धर्ष दिष्ट्या शत्रुर्निपातितः॥<br />By good luck, you had paid off your debt to your mother and to your wrath! By good luck, you have been victorious, O invincible hero, and by good luck, your enemy has been killed.'</p>
