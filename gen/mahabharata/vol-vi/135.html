<p id='2'>दत्त्वा दानं द्विजातिभ्यो रजनी तामुपोष्य च। पूजितो मुनिसद्धैश्च प्रातरुत्थाय लागली॥ अनुज्ञाप्य मुनीन् सर्वान् स्पृष्ट्वा तोयं च भारत। प्रययौ त्वरितो रामस्तीर्थहेतोर्महावलः॥<br />Having distributed wealth amongst the Brahmanas and passed the night there the hero, having the plough for his weapon, was adored by the ascetics. Rising up in the morning, he took leave of all the ascetics and having touched the sacred water, O Bharata, started quickly for other tirthas.</p>
<p id='3'>ततस्त्वौशनसं तीर्थमाजगाम हलायुधः कपालमोचनं नाम यत्र मुक्तो महामुनिः॥ महता शिरसा राजन् ग्रस्तजङ्घो महोदरः। राक्षसस्य महाराज रामक्षिप्तस्य वै पुरा॥<br />Baladeva then went to the tirtha known by the name of Ushanas. It is also called Kapalamochana. Formerly, Rama (the son of Dasharatha) slew a Rakshasa and threw his head to a great distance. That head, O king, fell upon the thigh of a great sage named Mahodara and struck to it. Bathing in this tirtha, the great Rishi was freed from that burthen. The great (Shukra) had practised his ascetic penances there.</p>

While living there. Shukra meditated upon the war of the Daityas and the Danavas.</p>

<p id='6'>जनमेजय उवाच कपालमोचनं ब्रह्मन्कथं यत्र महामुनिः॥ मुक्तः कथं चास्य शिरो लग्नं केन च हेतुना।<br />Janamejaya said Why is it called Kapalamochana, where the great Muni became freed (from the Rakshasa's head)? Why and how did that head stick to his thigh?"</p>
<p id='7'>वैशम्पायन उवाच पुरा वै दण्डकारण्ये राघवेण महात्मना॥ वसता राजशार्दूल राक्षसान् शमयिष्यता।<br />Vaishampayana said "Formerly, O foremost of king, the great Rama (the son of Dasharatha) lived for sometime in the forest of Dandaka, for killing the Rakshasas.</p>

<p id='11'>जगाम सर्वतीर्थानि पृथिव्यां चेति नः श्रुतम्। स गत्वा सरितः सर्वाः समुद्रांश्च महातपाः॥<br />Feeling great pain and with putrid matter flowing from his thigh, he travelled to all the tirthas of the earth, one after another, as heard by us.</p>
<p id='12'>कथयामास तत् सर्वमृषीणां भावितात्मनाम्। आप्लुत्य सर्वतीर्थेषु न च मोक्षमवाप्तवान्॥ स तु शुश्राव विप्रेन्द्र मुनीनां वचनं महत्। सरस्वत्यास्तीर्थवरं ख्यातमौशनसं तदा॥ सर्वपापप्रशमनं सिद्धिक्षेत्रमनुत्तमम्। स तु गत्वा ततस्तत्र तीर्थमौशनसं द्विजः॥<br />He went to all the rivers and to the ocean as well. The great ascetic spoke of his pain to many Rishis of pure souls, about his having bathed in all the sacred spots without finding any relief.
