<h3>KARNA PARVA: Chapter 7O</h3><h4>Assurance to Yudhishthira</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>संजय उवाच इत्येवमुक्तस्तु जनार्दनेन पार्थः प्रशस्याथ सुहृदवचस्तत्। मनुक्तपूर्वं परुषं प्रसह्य॥ काले हि<br />Sanjaya said Being thus spoken to by Janardana, Pritha's son Arjuna highly approved of the friendly counsels and then addressing Yudhishthira, the righteous, in a sullen tone, spoke such harsh words as he had never before done.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>अर्जुन उवाच मा त्वं राजन् व्याहर व्याहरस्व यस्तिष्ठसे क्रोशमात्रे रणाद् वै। भीमस्तु मामर्हति गर्हणाय यो युध्यते सर्वलोकप्रवीरैः॥ शत्रून् परिपीड्य संख्ये हत्वा च शूरान् पृथिवीपतींस्तान्। रथप्रधानोत्तमनागमुख्यान् सादिप्रवेकानमितांश्च वीरान्॥ यः कुञ्जराणामधिकं सहस्रं हत्वा नदंस्तुमुलं सिंहनादम्। काम्बोजानामयुतं पर्वतीयान् मृगान् सिंहो विनिहत्येव चाजौ॥ सुदुष्करं कर्म करोति धीरः कर्तुं यथा नार्हसि त्वं कदाचित्। स्तया निहन्त्यश्वरथद्विपान् रणे॥ स्तथा रथाङ्गैर्धनुषा दहत्यरीन्। प्रमृद्य पद्भ्यामहितान् निहन्ति पुनस्तु दो• शतमन्युविक्रमः॥ महाबलौ वैश्रवणान्तकोपमः प्रसह्य हन्ता द्विषतामनीकिनाम्। स भीमसेनोऽर्हति गर्हणां मे न त्वं नित्यं रक्ष्यसे यः सुहृद्भिः॥<br />Arjuna said O king, you should upbraid me no more. You who are at a distance of about two miles from the battle-field, should not upbraid me for nothing. He who having, in fair fight, defeated the enemies and slain those chivalrous lords of Earth and their best and leading car-warriors, elephants, cavalry and innumerable combatants, has been fighting with the foremost of heroes; he, who having routed in fight more than a thousand elephants and ten thousand soldiers of the Kambojamountaineers has been yelling as a lion roars after having killed many a deer; that Bhima may upbraid me. The wonderful feats the hero Vrikodara has been achieving on jumping down from his chariot with mace in hand and the innumerable horses, cars and elephants he has been destroying, are such, the like of which you can never achieve. That hero, with the valour of Indra, has been, with the best of swords, splitting down riders with horses and elephants and has been consuming the enemies with arrows and the broken limbs of cars and spreading death all around with his feet and hands. Indeed, Bhimasena, mighty like Yama and Kubera, readily slays the hostile army. That Bhimasena may revile me and not you who are ever being protected by friends.</p>

<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>कलिङ्गवङ्गनिषादमागधान् सदामदानीलवलाहकोपमान्। निहन्ति यः शत्रुगजाननेकान् स मामुपालब्धुमरिंदमोऽर्हति॥<br />He, who has been slaying, in numbers the ever-furious elephants of the hostile Anga, Banga, Kalinga, Nishada and Magadha, that look like masses of blue clouds; that Bhimasena, the chastiser of enemies, may find fault with me.</p>

<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>बलं तु वाचि द्विजसत्तमानां क्षात्रं बुधा बाहुबलं वदन्तिा त्वं वाग्बलो भारत निष्ठुरश्च त्वमेव मां वेत्य यथाबलोऽहम्॥<br />O Bharata, the learned men say that the strength of the foremost of Brahmanas lies in words and the main strength of the Kshatriyas is in their arms; but your strength lies in your words, moreover you are wanton. As for me, it is not unknown to you what stuff I am made of.</p>

Having thyself committed a sin, to which the low alone are addicted, you are now trying to get off from your foes through our aid.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>अक्षेपु दोषा बहवो विधर्माः श्रुतास्त्वया सहदेवोऽब्रवीद् यान्। स्तेन स्म सर्वे निरयं प्रपन्नाः॥<br />You had heard of the immorality and the numerous evils of playing at dice, dilated upon by Sahadeva. Yet you could not forego those evils practised by the wicked alone. It is but for this that we are steeped in distress.</p>

Hear me tell you of it. Suicide is tantamount to fratricide and in either case condemnation to the same hell would have been inevitable.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>स्तथा हतात्मा भवितासि पार्थ। तथास्तु कृष्णेत्यभिनन्द्य तद्वचो धनंजयः प्राह धनुर्विनाम्य॥ युधिष्ठिरं धर्मभृतां वरिष्ठं शृणुष्व राजनिति शक्रसूनुः।<br />Therefore, O Partha, now recount to him your merits and valourous deeds and you shall thereby slay yourself.” Dhananjaya, the son of Sakra (Indra) hailed these words, saying-"Be it so."
