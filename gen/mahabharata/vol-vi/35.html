You do, therefore, hold the reins of the horses in the field of battle, O foremost of persons.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>यथा देवगणैस्तत्र वृतो यत्नात् पितामहः। तथास्माभिर्भवान् यत्नात् कर्णादभ्यधिकोवृतः॥<br />Even as, on that occasion, the Grandsire was elected by all the celestials with great care, so you, who are superior to Karna, are selected with great care by us.</p>

O descendant of the Bharata race, I have also heard how the great Grandsire acted as the charioteer of Bhava and how the Asuras were all slaughtered with a single arrow.</p>
