<h3>KARNA PARVA: Chapter 76</h3><h4>The conversation between Bhimasena and Vishoka</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>संजय उवाच अथ त्विदानीं तुमले विमर्दे द्विषद्भिरको बहुभिः समावृतः। महारणे सारथिमित्युवाच भीमश्चमूं वाहय धार्तराष्ट्रीम्॥<br />Sanjaya said In the thick of that awe-inspiring fray, Bhima, fighting single-handed, against tremendous odds, addressed his charioteer and said-"drive towards the centre of the Dhartarashtra force."</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>त्वं सारथे याहि जवेन वाहैनृयाम्येतान् धार्तराष्ट्रान् यमाय। संचोदितो भीमसेनेन चैवं स सारथिः पुत्रबलं त्वदीयम्॥ प्रायात् ततः सत्वरमुग्रवेगो यतो भीमस्तद् बलं गन्मुमैच्छत। ततोऽपरे नागरथाश्वपत्तिभिः प्रत्युद्ययुस्तं कुरवः समन्तात्॥<br />Spur your horses, O charioteer and I will hasten the departure of all these Dhartarashtras to the region occupied by the King of Death." The charioteer, being thus desired by Bhimasena, drove, at a furious speed, towards the spot against the whole hosts of your sons and from whence Bhima wished to fight them out and then, from all sides, a large retinue of Kaurava force, consisting of elephant and carwarriors and cavalry and infantry, hemmed him in.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>भीमस्य वाहाण्यमुदारवेगं समन्ततो बाणगणैर्निजघ्नुः। ततः शरानापततो महात्मा चिच्छेद बाणैस्तपनीयपुखैः॥<br />And they all poured down their arrows on that best of chariots occupied by Bhima from every direction, whereupon the high-souled Bhima, with his own gold-feathered shafts, scattered to the winds, all those weapons hurled against him by his enemies.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>ते वै निपेतुस्तपनीयपुङ्खा द्विधा त्रिधा भीमशरैर्निकृताः। ततो राजन् नगरथाश्वयूनां भीमहतानां वरराजमध्ये॥ घोरो निनादः प्रबभौ नरेन्द्र वजाहतानामिव पर्वतानाम्। ते वध्यमानाश्च नरेन्द्रमुख्या निर्भिद्यन्तो भीमशरप्रवेकैः॥ भीमं समन्तात् समरेऽभ्यरोहन् वृक्षं शकुन्ता इव जातपक्षाः। ततोऽभियाते तव सैन्ये स भीमः प्रादुश्चके वेगमनन्तवेगः॥ भूतान्तकृत काल इवात्तदण्डः। तस्यातिवेगस्य रणेऽतिवेगं नाशक्नुवन् वारयितुं त्वदीयाः॥ व्यात्ताननस्यापततो यथैव कालस्य काले हरतः प्रजा वै। ततो बलं भारत भारतानां प्रदह्यमानं समरे महात्मना॥ भीतं दिशोऽकीर्यत भीमनुन्नं महानिलेनाभ्रगणा यथैव। ततो धीमान् सारथिमबभीद् बली स भीमसेनः पुनरेव हृष्टः॥ सूताभिजानीहि स्वकान् परान् वा रथान् ध्वजांश्चापततः समेतान्। न्मा सैन्यं स्वं छादयिष्ये पृषत्कैः॥<br />And those gold-winged arrows of his enemies, thus broken into tatters of two or three fragments by the shafts of Bhima, fell upon the ground. Then, O King, there arose one long loud cry of woe from amidst the throng of those valiant chiefs of the Kshatriya race, as they, with their mounts of elephants and steeds and their chariots and body infantry, got afflicted with the arrows thrust hard by Bhima, like thunders rolling in mountains. Those pride of the Kshatriya race, being thus assailed by Bhima, and his powerful shafts smiting them hip and thigh, flew at him (Bhima) from every side of the plain, like the new-fledged family of the feathered tribes thickening around a tree. And as your troops fell back upon him, Bhima, of infinite prowess and strength, repulsed them with the full display of all his might, like the mighty King of Terrors, dealing destruction, at the end of time, with his mace, unto the creation. And your hosts, in that battle, could not repel the fearful impetuosity of Bhima, himself the personation of fire and fury, like the great Destroyer himself rushing, at the end of the cycle, with wide-open mouth for the extermination of all living beings. O Bharata, the whole troops, comprising the Bharata force, thus ruthlessly torn as under in battle, by the noble-minded Bhima, dispersed from the field in a state of panic, like a strong gust of wind scattering thick clouds in a tempest. Then the powerful Bhimasena, endowed with great sagacity, addressing his charioteer once more, said unto him in full glee. "Just know, O Suta, whether do all those chariots, which are advancing towards us, belong to our party, or to that of the enemy. As I, with this battle raging, can make no distinction between the two, see that I do not besiege my own hosts with my shafts.</p>

The king lies wounded and the diadem-decked Arjuna is not yet come to take the field. All these, O Suta, are preying heavily on me.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>एतद् दुःखं सारथे धर्मराजो यन्मां हित्वा यातवाशत्रुमध्ये। नैनं जीवं नाद्य जानाम्यजीवं बीभत्सुं वा तन्ममाद्यातिदुःखम्॥<br />O charioteer, that the pious king Yudhishthira should have gone away from the field, leading me alone in the midst of the enemy, is in itself hear-rending. Then again I am quite in the dark as to his fate. Nor do I know whether Vibhatsu is still alive or not. All these add to my grief.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>सोऽहं द्विषत्सैन्यमुदग्रकल्पं विनाशयिष्ये परमप्रतीतः। एतत्रिहत्याजिमध्ये समेतं प्रीतो भविष्यामि सह त्वयाद्य॥<br />And though dejected and disspirited, I will play the hell with all these troops inspite of their strength. And thus making the vast army in hostile array pay the penalty in the wager of battle, let me rejoice with you today.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>सर्वांस्तूणान् सायकानामवेक्ष्य किं शिष्टं स्यात् सायकानां रथे मे। का वा जातिः किं प्रमाणं च तेषां ज्ञात्वा व्यक्तं तत् समाचक्ष्व सूत॥<br />O Suta, examine closely all the quivers of my arrows and see the numbers still left and then let me know decidedly the quantity and variety of each.”</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>विशोक उवाच षण्मार्गणानामयुतानि वीर क्षुराश्च भल्लाश्च तथायुताख्याः। नाराचानां द्वे सहस्रे च वीर त्रीण्येव च प्रदराणां स्म पार्थ॥<br />Vishoka said Being thus addressed, Vishoka replied-"O hero, you have full sixty thousand arrows still left, while your shafts, both razor-shaped and broad-pointed, number ten thousand each. O hero, you have still two thousand cloth-yard shafts, while the Pradaras, O Partha, number three thousand.</p>

O skillful one, throw off your weapons in no measured number, for your maces, swords and scimitars, as also your lances darts and spears and other weapons of the arms, number thousands upon thousands. So be of good cheer and pray do not be misapprehensive of your weapons running short."</p>

<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>सर्वे संख्ये कुरवो निष्पतन्तु मां वा लोकाः कीर्तयन्त्वाकुमारम्। सर्वानेकस्तानहं पातयिष्ये ते वा सर्वे भीमसेनं तुदन्तु॥<br />Today, either let the Kauravas fall in battle, or, let all the world sound my death knell. Alone, encountering them all, I will either overmatch them, or, let them, all combined, put an extinguisher upon Bhimasena.</p>

Why are all these chiefs taking to their flight. Surely it seems to me inevitable that Savyasachin, that best of human beings has been shrouding that force with a heavy downpour of his arrows.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>पश्य ध्वजांश्च द्रवतो विशोक नागान् हयान् पत्तिसंघांश्च संख्ये। रथान् विकीर्णाशरशक्तिताडितान् पश्यस्वैतान् रथिनश्चैव सूत॥<br />Look there, O Vishoka, (and see how) the mounted soldiers riding on their steeds or elephants and standard-bearers and footsoldiers and beating their retreat. Look, also, at these war-chariots, (and see how) they with their warriors on, are getting scattered by the darts, shafts and arrows, O Suta.</p>

In sooth, the whole host of the Kauravas, seized with consternation, are beating a hasty retreat, as do the terrified elephants in the midst of a flaming forest. The elephants are roaring furiously in the field and their savage cries, O Vishoka, make, one and all, utter cries of woe and alas!'</p>

(or), have those ears of yours lost their sensibility from the effects of the thunder produced by Partha, while out stretching it with fire and fury?</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>सर्वे कामाः पाण्डव ते समृद्धाः कपिसी दृश्यते हस्तिसैन्ये। नीलाद घनाद् विद्युतमुचरन्तीं तथा पश्य विस्फुरन्ती धनुाम्॥<br />All your wishes, O son of Pandu, have been gratified, yonder is seen the standard of Ape (of Arjuna) wafting aloft.
