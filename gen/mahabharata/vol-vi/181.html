<p id='2'>विदुर उवाच उत्तिष्ठ राजन् किं शेषे धारयात्मानमात्मना। एषा वै सर्वसत्त्वानां लोकेश्वर परा गतिः॥<br />Vidura said Rise, O king! Why are you lying on the Earth. Cheer yourself up. O king, this is the final end of all living creatures.</p>
<p id='3'>सर्वे क्षयान्ता निचयाः पतनान्ताः समुच्छ्रयाः। संयोगा विप्रयोगान्ता मरणान्तं च जीवितम्॥<br />Everything is liable to destruction; everything that is high is sure to fall down. Union is sure to end in separation; life is sure to end in death.</p>
<p id='4'>यदा शूरं च भीरुं च यमः कर्षति भारत। तत् किं न योत्स्यन्ति हि ते क्षत्रियाः क्षत्रियर्षभ॥<br />The Destroyer, O Bharata, takes both the hero and the coward. Why then, O foremost of Kshatriyas, should not Kshatriyas engage themselves in battle.</p>
<p id='5'>अयुध्यमानो म्रियते युध्यमानश्च जीवति। कालं प्राप्य महाराज न कश्चिदतिवर्तते॥<br />He, who never fights has been seen to die, while he who engaged himself in battle has been seen to escape alive.</p>
<p id='6'>अभावादीनि भूतानि भावमध्यानि भारत। अभावनिधनान्येव तत्र का परिदेवना॥<br />As regards living creatures, they did not exist at first. They exist in the intervening period. In the end they once more become nonexistent. Why should then one grieve for the same?</p>
<p id='7'>न शोचन् मृतमन्वेति न शोचन् म्रियते नरः। एवं सांसिद्धिके लोके किमर्थमनुशोचसि।।७<br />The man who grieves does not succeed in meeting with the dead. By grieving one does not himself die. While such is the course of the world, why do you indulge in grief.</p>
<p id='8'>कालः कर्षति भूतानि सर्वाणि विविधान्युत। न कालस्य प्रियः कश्चिन्न द्वेष्यः कुरुसत्तम॥<br />Death drags all creatures, even the gods. There is none dear or hateful to death, O Kuru chief.</p>
<p id='9'>यथा वायुस्तृणाग्राणि संवर्तयति सर्वशः। तथा कालवशं यान्ति भूतानि भरतर्षभ॥<br />As the wind tears off all the blades of grass, even so, O foremost of Bharata's race, Death rules over all creatures.</p>
<p id='10'>एकसार्थप्रयातानां सर्वेषां तत्र गामिनाम्। यस्य कालः प्रयात्यग्रे तत्र का परिदेवना॥<br />All creatures are like members of a caravan bound for the same country. When death will overtake all, it is immaterial whom he meets first.</p>
<p id='11'>न चाप्येतान् हतान् युद्धे राजशोचितुमर्हसि। प्रमाणं यदि शास्त्राणि गतास्ते परमां गतिम्॥<br />O king, you should not grieve for those who have been killed in battle. If the scriptures are authoritative all of them must have obtained the highest end.</p>
<p id='12'>सर्वे स्वाध्यायवन्तो हि सर्वे च चरितव्रताः। सर्वे चाभिमुखाः क्षीणास्तत्र का परिदेवना॥<br />All of them were well read in the Vedas; all of them had practised vows. All of them have met with death after fighting with the enemy. What is there to be sorry in this.</p>
<p id='13'>अदर्शनादापतिताः पुनश्चादर्शनं गताः। नैते तव न तेषां त्वं तत्र का परिदेवना॥<br />They had been invisible before birth. Having come from that unknown region, they have again become invisible. They are not yours, nor are you theirs. Why should you grieve then for such disappearance?</p>
<p id='14'>हतोऽपि लभते स्वर्ग हत्वा च लभते यशः। उभयं नो बहुगुणं नास्ति निष्फलता रणे॥<br />If killed, one acquires heaven. By killing, fame is acquired. Both of these, produce great merit. Battle, therefore, is not unproductive of good.</p>
<p id='15'>तेषां कामदुधालँ लोकानिन्द्रः संकल्पयिष्यति। इन्द्रस्यातिथयो ोते भवन्ति भरतर्षभ।१५।।<br />forsooth, Indra will give them regions capable of granting every wish. These, O foremost of men, become the guests of Indra.</p>
<p id='16'>न यज्ञैर्दक्षिणावद्भिर्न तपोभिर्न विद्यया। स्वर्ग यान्ति तथा मा यथा शूरा रणे हताः॥<br />By celebrating sacrifice with profuse gifts, by ascetic penances and by learning, men cannot, go so quickly to heaven as heroes killed in battle.</p>
<p id='17'>शरीरग्निषु शूराणां जुहुवुस्ते शराहुतीः। हूयमानाशरांश्चैव सेहुस्तेजस्विनो मिथः॥<br />On the bodies of hostile heroes who were like the sacrificial fire, they poured libations of arrows. Highly energetic, they had in return to bear the arrowy libations poured upon them by their foes.</p>
<p id='18'>एवं राजंस्तवाचक्षे स्वयं पन्थानमुत्तमम्। न युद्धादधिकं किंचित् क्षत्रियस्येह विद्यते॥<br />I tell you, O king, that for a Kshatriya in this world there is not a better way to heaven then battle.</p>
<p id='19'>क्षत्रियास्ते महात्मानः शूराः समितिशोभनाः। आशिषः परमाः प्राप्त न शोर्ध्या सर्व एव हि॥<br />They were all great Kshatriyas; brave as they were, they were ornaments of assemblies. They have attained highest of blessed regions. They are not persons for whom we should be sorry.</p>

<p id='22'>शोकस्थानसहस्राणि भयस्थानशतानि च। दिवसे दिवसे मूढमाविशन्ति च पण्डितम्॥<br />Thousands of causes spring up daily for sorrow and thousands for fear. These, however, affect the ignorant and not the wise.</p>

<p id='25'>अनित्यं यौवनं रूपं जीवितं द्रव्यसंचयः। आरोग्यं प्रियसंवासो गृद्ध्येदेषु न पण्डितः॥<br />Youth, beauty, life, wealth, health, and friends, are all unstable. The wise will never seek any of these.</p>
<p id='26'>न जानपदिकं दुःखमेकः शोचितुमर्हसि। अप्यभावेन युज्यते तचास्य न निवर्तते॥<br />You should not grieve for what is universal. By indulging in grief a person may himself die, but grief itself by being indulged in, never becomes light.</p>

<p id='28'>चिन्त्यमानं हि न व्येति भूयश्चापि प्रवर्धते। अनिष्टसम्प्रयोगाच विप्रयोगात् प्रियस्य च॥ मानुषा मानसैर्दुःखैर्दह्यन्ते चाल्पबुद्धयः।<br />By indulging in it, one cannot lesson it. On the other hand, it increases when being indulged in. When any evil or when bereavement of some dear one, comes on, only they that are of little intelligence allow their minds to be laden with grief.</p>
<p id='29'>नार्थो न धर्मो न सुखं यदेतदनुशोचसि॥ न च नापैति कार्यार्थात्रिवर्गाचैव हीयते।<br />This is neither Profit, nor Religion, nor Happiness, of which you are thinking.</p>
<p id='30'>अन्यामन्यां धनावस्थां प्राप्य वैशेषिकी नराः॥ असंतुष्टाः प्रमुह्यनित संतोष यान्ति पण्डिताः। प्रज्ञया मानसं दुःखं हन्याच्छरीरमौषधैः। एतद् विज्ञानसामर्थ्यं न बालैः समतामियात्॥<br />The indulgence of grief in the sure means of one's losing one's objects. Through it, one deviates from the three great ends of life. They, who are not contented are stupefied by the vicissitudes of fortune. The wise, are, on the other hand, unaffected by such changes. One should destroy mental grief by wisdom, as physical grief should be destroyed by medicine. Wisdom has this power. They, however, that are foolish, can never acquire equanimity of mind.</p>
<p id='31'>शयानं चानुशेते हि तिष्ठन्तं चानुतिष्ठति। अनुधावति धावन्तं कर्म पूर्वकृतं नरम्॥<br />Pristine actions closely follow a man, so much so that they lie by him when he lies down, stand by him when he stands, and run with him when he runs.</p>
<p id='32'>यस्यां यस्यामवस्थायां यत् करोति शुभाशुभम्। तस्यां तस्यामवस्थायां तत्फलं समुपाश्नुते॥<br />As a man acts well or ill, so he enjoys or suffers the fruit thereof.</p>

<p id='35'>शुभेन कर्मणा सौख्यं दुःखं पापेन कर्मणा। कृतं भवति सर्वत्र नाकृतं विद्यते क्वचित्॥<br />Good acts beget a state of happiness, and sinful deeds bring on woe. One always reaps the fruit of one's acts. One never enjoys of suffers happiness or misery that is not the outcome of one's own acts.</p>
