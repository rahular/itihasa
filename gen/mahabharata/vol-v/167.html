<h3>None: Chapter 167</h3><h4>Prowess of Sahadeva</h4><p id='1'>संजय उवाच सहदेवमथायान्तं द्रोणप्रेप्सु विशाम्पते। कर्णो वैकर्तनो युद्धे वारयामास भारत॥<br />Sanjaya said Karna, the son of Vikartana, O king, checked in battle the great car-warrior Shahadeva who was advancing with the desire of slaying Drona.</p>
<p id='2'>सहदेवस्तु राधेयं विद्ध्वा नवभिराशुगैः। पुनर्विव्याध दशभिर्विशिखैनतपर्वभिः॥२॥<br />Shahadeva, also piercing the son of Radha with nine arrows, pierced him again in that encounter with nine straight (shafts).</p>
<p id='3'>तं कर्णः प्रतिविव्याध शतेन नतपर्वणाम्। सज्यं चास्य धनुः शीघ्रं चिच्छेद लघुहस्तवत्॥<br />Karna (also) pierced him in return with a hundred straight arrows and then with great light-handedness quickly cut-off his stringed bow.</p>
<p id='4'>ततोऽन्यद् धनुरादाय माद्रीपुत्रः प्रतापवान्। कर्णं विव्याध विंशत्या तदद्भुतमिवाभवत्॥<br />Thereupon the puissant son of Madri taking up another bow, pierced Karna with twenty shafts and this appeared wonderful.</p>
<p id='5'>तस्य कर्णो हयान हत्वा शरैः संनतपर्वभिः। सारथिं चास्य भल्लेन द्रुतं निन्ये यमक्षयम्॥<br />(Then) Karna, having destroyed his horses with straight shafts, quickly sent his charioteer, with a broad-headed dart, to the abode of Yama.</p>
<p id='6'>विस्थः सहदेवस्तु खङ्ग चर्म समाददे। तदप्यस्य शरैः कर्णो व्यधमत् प्रहसन्निव॥<br />Made carless (thus), Shahadeva then took up a scimitar and a shield. But (Karma) cut-off those (things) also with a smile.</p>
<p id='7'>अथ गुर्वी महाघोरां हेमचित्रां महागदाम्। प्रेषयामास संक्रुद्धो वैकर्तनरथं प्रति॥<br />Thereupon the highly-puissant Shahadeva, in that engagement, hurled a heavy and formidable mace ornamented with gold, at the car of the son of Vikartana.</p>
<p id='8'>तामापतन्ती सहसा सहदेवप्रचोदिताम्। व्यष्टम्भयच्छरैः कर्णो भूमौ चैनामपातयत्॥<br />Karna, however, cut-off with shafts that mace which, hurled by the Shahadeva, was making for him with great force and caused it to fall on the ground.</p>
<p id='9'>गदां विनिहतां दृष्ट्वा सहदेवस्त्वरान्वितः। शक्तिं चिक्षेप कर्णाय तामप्यस्याच्छिनच्छरैः॥<br />Seeing that his cut-off, Shahadeva, with great haste, hurled a dart at mace was Karna. But that too was cut-off with arrows (by Karna).</p>
<p id='10'>ससम्भ्रमं ततस्तूर्णमवप्लुत्य रथोत्तमात्। सहदेवो महाराज दृष्ट्वा कर्णं व्यवस्थितम्॥<br />The son of Madri, then, speedily jumping down from his excellent car and burning with indignation, as it were, at the sight of Karna stationed (before him).</p>
<p id='11'>रथचक्रं प्रगृह्याजौ मुमोचाधिरथिं प्रति। तदापतद् वै सहसा कालचक्रमिवोद्यतम्॥<br />And taking up a car-wheel, discharged it at the son of Adhiratha. That (wheel), which was careering impetuously (towards him), like the upraised wheel of Death.</p>
<p id='12'>शरैरनेकसाहस्रैराच्छिनत् सूतनन्दनः। तस्मिस्तु निहते चक्रे सूतजेन महात्मना।॥<br />Was cut-off by the charioteer's son with many thousands arrows. The car-wheel being thus cut to pieces, Shahadeva then, O worshipful sire.</p>
<p id='13'>ईषादण्डकयोक्त्रांश्च युगानि विविधानि च। हस्त्यङ्गानि तथाश्वांश्च मृतांश्च पुरुषान् बहून्॥ चिक्षेप कर्णमुद्दिश्य कर्णस्तान् व्यधमच्छरैः। स निरायुधमात्मानं ज्ञात्वा साद्रवतीसुतः॥<br />Aiming at Karna, hurled at him the shaft of his car, the harnesses of his steeds, the yokes of cars, the limbs of elephants and horses and also dead human bodies. (But) Karna destroyed all these with shafts. Well aware that he had no weapons (to fight with), the son of Madri, that is.</p>
<p id='14'>वार्यमाणस्तु विशिखैः सहदेवो रणं जहौ। तमभिद्रुत्य राधेयो मुहूर्ताद् भरतर्षभ।॥<br />Shahadeva, resisted with arrows (by Karna) withdrew from the battle. The son of Radha, (however), pursuing (and overtaking) him quickly in a moment, O best of the Bharatas.</p>
<p id='15'>अब्रवीत् प्रहसन् वाक्यं सहदेवं विशाम्पते। मा युध्यस्व रणेऽधीर विशिष्टै रथिभिः सह॥<br />Addressed these very cruel words with a smile, to Shahadeva-"O iro, do not engage in fight with superior car-warriors.</p>
<p id='16'>सदृशैयुध्य माद्रेय वचो मे मा विशङ्किथाः। अथैनं धनुषोऽग्रेण तुदन भूयोऽब्रवीद् वचः॥<br />O son of Madri, you ought to fight with your equals (only). Do not mistrust my words." Then touching him with the end of his bow, he</p>
<p id='17'>एषोऽर्जुनो रणे तूर्णं युध्यते कुरुभिः सह। तत्र गच्छस्व माद्रेय गृहं वा यदि मन्यसे॥<br />Yonder Arjuna is fighting resolutely with the Kurus. O son of Madri, either go there or return home, which ever you like.</p>
<p id='18'>एवमुक्त्वा तु तं कर्णो रथेन रथिनां वरः। प्रायात् पाञ्चालपाण्डूनां सैन्यानि प्रदहन्निव॥<br />Having addressed him thus, Karna, the foremost of car-warriors, advanced smilingly against the troops of the Panchala king.</p>
<p id='19'>वधं प्राप्तं तु माद्रेयं नावधीत् समरेऽरिहा। कुन्त्याः स्मृत्वा वचो राजन् सत्यसंधो महायशाः।। २०<br />Remembering the words of Kunti, that mighty car-warrior and slayer of foes in battle, firm in truth, did not, O king, slay the son of Madri though he could do so.</p>
<p id='20'>सहदेवस्ततो राजन् विमना: शरपीडितः। कर्णवाक्छरतप्तश्च जीवितानिरविद्यत॥<br />With his mind ill at ease, afflicted with darts and smitten with the words of Karna (poignant) as darts, Shahadeva lost all love for life.</p>
<p id='21'>आरुरोह रथं चापि पाञ्चाल्यस्य महात्मनः। जनमेजयस्य समरे त्वरायुक्ते महारथः॥<br />(And) that great car-warrior in that battle, with great haste mounted the car of Janamejaya, the high-souled Panchalas.</p>
