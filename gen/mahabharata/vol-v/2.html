<h3>DRONABHISHEKA PARVA: Chapter 2</h3><h4>The setting out of Karna</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>संजय उवाच हतं भीष्मथाधिरथिर्विदित्वा भिन्नां नावमिवात्यगाधे कुरूणाम्। सोदर्यवद् व्यसनात् सूतपुत्रः संतारयिष्यंस्तव पुत्रस्य सेनाम्॥<br />Sanjaya said Then Adhiratha's son of the Suta caste, knowing that Bhisma had fallen, became desirous of saving, like a brother, the army of your son from the calamity it was in, like a boat split in the midst of the unfathomable deep.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>श्रुत्वा तु कर्णः पुरुषेन्द्रमच्युतं निपातितं शान्तनवं महारथम्। अथोपयायात् सहसारिकर्षणो धनुर्धराणां प्रवरस्तदा नृप॥<br />Having heard that the son of Shantanu, that foremost of men, the never-dropping one and the best of all car-warriors, had been slain, O king, Karna the repressor of enemies and the foremost of all bowmen, speedily arrived at the field of battle.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>निमज्जती नावमिवार्णवे कुरून्। पितेव पुत्रांस्त्वरितोऽभ्ययात् ततः संतारयिष्यंस्तव पुत्रस्य सेनाम्॥<br />When that excellent of car-warriors, Bhishma had been slain by the enemy, Karna soon (came of the battle field), desirous of saving the army of your son resembling a boat sunk in the deep, like a father anxious for rescuing his sons.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>कर्ण उवाच यस्मिन् धृतिर्बुद्धिपराक्रमौजः सत्यं स्मृतिर्वीरगुणाश्च सर्वे। अस्त्राणि दिव्यान्यथ संलतिहीं: प्रिया च वागनसूया च भीष्मे॥ सदा कृतज्ञे द्विजशत्रुघातके सनातनं चन्द्रमसीव लक्ष्म। स चेत् प्रशान्तः परवीरहन्ता मन्ये हतानेव च सर्ववीरान्॥<br />Karna said When that Bhishma, who was endued with resoluteness, intelligence, prowess, energy, truthfulness, self-control and with all the other attributes of a hero; who was proficient in the use of celestial weapons; in whom there were humility, bashfulness, sweet speech and harmlessness; who was always grateful, the slayer of the enemies of the twice-borns, in whom there resided all these virtues for ever that Bhishma the destroyer of hostilc heroes had obtained his quietus, I consider the remaining warriors as already slain.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>नेह ध्रुवं किंचन जातु विद्यते लोके ह्यस्मिन् कर्मणोऽनित्ययोगात्। सूर्योदये को हि विमुक्तसंशयो भावं कुर्वीतार्य महाव्रते हते॥<br />Owing to the constant connection with action, there is nothing in this world that is eternal. When that one of illustrious vows (Bhishma) has been killed today, what man can say with certitude that today, what man can say with certitude that tomorrow the sun will rise?</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>वसुप्रभावे वसुवीर्यसम्भवे गते वसूनेव वसुन्धराधिपे। वसूनि पुत्रांश्च वसुन्धरां तथा कुरूंश्च शोचध्वमिनां च वाहिनीम्॥<br />When that one of prowess equal to that of the Vasus, when he that was born of the energy of the Vasus, when that ruler of earth has gone back to the Vasus, do you then lament for your wealth, your sons and this army?</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>संजय उवाच महाप्रभावे वरदे निपातिते लोकेश्वरे शास्तरि चामितौजसि। पराजितेषु भरतेषु दुर्मनाः कर्णो भृशंन्यश्वसदश्रु वर्तयन्॥<br />Sanjaya said When that giver of boons, that most puicsant hero, that lord of men, that one of great vigour had been slain, that when the Bharatas had been vanquished, Karna, with a sorrowful heart and shedding copious tears, began to comfort (the Kurus).</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>इदं च राधेयवचो निशम्य सुताश्च राजंस्तव सैनिकाश्च ह। स्तदाश्रु नेत्रैर्मुमुचुश्च शब्दवत्॥ प्रवर्तमाने तु पुनर्महाहवे विगाह्यमानासु चमूषु पार्थिवैः। अथाब्रवीद्धर्षकरं तदा वचो रथर्षभान् सर्वमहारथर्षभः॥<br />Having heard, O monarch, these wordr of the son of Radha, your sons and your soldiers, out of grief, broke out into loud lamentations and shed tears from their eyes, which were as copious as their wails were loud. When the sanguinary engagement waged anew and the Kaurava host led by kings once more roared forth (their battle-cry), then that foremost of all Maharathis (Karna) addressed these words to the mighty car-warriors, that imparted joy to their hearts.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>जगत्यनित्ये सततं प्रधावति प्रचिन्तयनस्थिरमद्य लक्षये। भवत्सु तिष्ठत्स्विह पातितो मृधे गिरिप्रकाशः कुरुपुङ्गवः कथम्॥<br />This transient words is ever flying (towards death); considering this I always regard everything as unsteady. When you were all present here, how could that foremost of the Kurus (Bhishma), who resembled a mountain in steadiness, be slain in battle?</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>निपातिते शान्तनवे महारथे दिवाकरे भूतलमास्थिते यथा। न पार्थिवाः सोढुमलं धनंजयं गिरिप्रवोढारमिवालिनं दुमाः॥<br />When like the sun dropping down on the earth, that foremost of car-warriors, the son of Shantanu has fallen, the monarchs (of the Kuru army) are hardly capable of withstanding Dhananjaya, like trees unable to withstand the hurricane that uproots even the hills.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>हतप्रधानं त्विदमार्तरूपं परैर्हतोत्साहमनाथमद्य वै। मया कुरूणां परिपाल्यमाहवे बलं यथा तेन महात्मना तथा॥<br />As that high-minded one did, so today will I protect, in this dreadful battle, this army of the Kurus, whose appearance is cheerless and whose zeal has been destroyed by the enemy, which is helpless and whose best warriors have already been slain.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>समाहितं चात्मनि भारमीदृशं जगत् तथानित्यमिदं च लक्षये। निपातितं चाहवशौण्डमाहवे कथं नु कुर्यामहमीदृशे भयम्॥<br />This heavy burden now devolves on myself; I shall that this world is transitory. That most excellent of warriors has also fallen in battle. Why shall I then entertain any apprehension for fighting?</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>अहं तु तान् कुरुवृषभानजिह्मगैः प्रवेशयन् यमसदनं चरन् रणे। यशः परं जगति विभाव्य वर्तिता परैर्हतो भुवि शयिताऽथवा पुनः॥<br />Coursing (swiftly) in the battle-field, I shall send, by means of my straight-going shafts, to the abode of Death, the foremost descendants of Kuru's race (Pandavas). Considering fame to be the best of all worldly possessions, I shall kill them in the engagement or myself lie on the field being slain by them.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>युधिष्ठिरो धृतिमतिसत्यसत्त्ववान् वृकोदरो गजशततुल्यविक्रमः। तथाऽर्जुनस्त्रिदशवरात्मजो युवा न तद्बलं सुजयमिहामरैरपि॥<br />Yudhishthira is endued with resoluteness, intelligence, piety and vigour; Vrikodara equals a hundred elephants in might; Arjuna also is youthful and the begotten son of the foremost of celestials; so the army belonging to them is not to be easily vanquished even by the immortals.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>यमौ रणे यत्र यमोपमौ बले ससात्यकिर्यत्र च देवकीसुतः। न तद्बलं कापुरुषोऽभ्युपेयिवान् निवर्तते मृत्युमुखान्न चासुभृत्॥<br />As no one ever returns alive from the jaws of death, so no coward ever returns (alive) after having confronted that hostile army to which belong the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), each resembling death himself in battle and in which are Satyaki and the son of Devaki.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>तपोऽभ्युदीर्णं तपसैव बाध्यते बलं बलेनैव तथा मनस्विभिः। मनश्च मे शत्रुनिवारणे ध्रुवं स्वरक्षणे चाचलवद् व्यवस्थितम्॥<br />Great power, begot of austerities, should be opposed by ascetic wealth. So should the wise oppose might with might. My mind is decided upon withstanding the enemy and it is resolutely fixed upon ensuring the safety (of my own troops).</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>एवं चैषां वाधमानः प्रभावं गत्वैवाहं ताञ्चयाम्यद्य सूत। मित्रद्रोहो मर्षणीयो न मेऽयं भग्ने सैन्ये यः समेयात् स मित्रम्॥<br />For certain, O charioteer, I shall today oppose their force and shall defeat them by simply going to the field. This conflict of friends (internecine war) ought not to be tolerated by men. He that helps in rallying a routed army is the true friend.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>कर्तास्म्येतत् सत्पुरुषार्यकर्म त्यक्त्वा प्राणाननुयास्यामि भीष्मम्। सर्वान् संख्ये शत्रुसंघान् हनिष्ये हतस्तैर्वा वीरलोकं प्रपत्स्ये॥<br />I shall either achieve this pious act of manliness or shall follow Bhishma, renouncing my vital breaths.
