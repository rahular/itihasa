<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>यः प्राप्य राज्यं धर्मेण ऋत्विग्ब्रह्मपुरोहितान्। अपृच्छदात्मनः श्रेयः पृष्ट्वा तेषां मते स्थितः॥<br />Having obtained his kingdom by virtue, he used to question his Ritvigas, family priests and Brahmanas about its welfare and then used to live up to their instructions.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>प्रजानां पालनं धर्मो दानमिज्या द्विषज्जयः। एतत् सुहोत्रो विज्ञाय धर्मेणैच्छद् धनागमम्॥<br />Knowing virtue to be identified with the protection of his subjects, acts of charity and performance of sacrifices and the subjugation of foes, Suhotra desired the increase of his wealth,</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>धर्मेणाराधयन् देवान् बाणैः शत्रूञ्जयंस्तथा। सर्वाण्यपि च भूतानि स्वगुणैरण्यरञ्जयत्।॥<br />He worshipped the gods according to the ordinances of the holy texts and conquered his foes by means of his arrows. He pleased all creatures with his own excellent acquirements.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>यो भुक्त्वेमां वसुमती म्लेच्छाटविकवर्जिताम्। यस्मै ववर्ष पर्जन्यो हिरण्यं परिवत्सरान्॥<br />During his time of rule, the earth was freed from the depredation of Mlecchas and the forest-thieves and the Parjanya showered gold throughout the whole year.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>हैरण्यास्तत्र वाहिन्यः स्वैरिण्यो व्यवहन् पुरा। ग्राहान् कर्कटकांश्चैव मत्स्यांश्च विविधान् बहून्॥ कामान् वर्षति पर्जन्यो रूप्याणि विविधानि च। सौवर्णान्यप्रमेयाणि वाप्यश्च क्रोशसम्मिताः॥<br />In those days of his the rivers ran liquid gold and were open to the use of everybody. Parjanya then poured on his kingdom large numbers of golden alligators, crabs and fishes of various classes and many other objects of desire; the artificial lakes of his dominions were full two miles long.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>सहस्रं वामनान् कुब्जान् नक्रान् मकरकच्छपान्। सौवर्णान् विहितान् दृष्ट्वा ततोऽस्मयत वै तदा॥<br />Then king Suhotra beholding thousands of dwarfs hunch-backs, alligators and sharks and tortoises, all made of gold, was greatly amazed.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>तत् सुवर्णमपर्यन्तं राजर्षिः कुरुजाङ्गले। ईजानो वितते यज्ञे ब्राह्मणेभ्यो ह्यमन्यत॥<br />That royal sage, having performed a sacrifice in Kurujangala, gave away that unlimited quantity of gold to the Brahmanas, even before the accomplishment of that sacrifice.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>सोऽश्वमेधसहस्रेण राजसूयशतेन च। पुण्यैः क्षत्रिययज्ञेश्च प्रभूतवरदक्षिणैः॥<br />Having celebrated thousand horsesacrifices, a hundred Rajasuya sacrifices and, numerous other Kshatriya sacrifices, in all of a which he gave away vast wealth as sacrificial presents.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>काम्यनैमित्तिकाजौरिष्टां गतिमवाप्तवान्। स चेन्ममार सृञ्जय चतुर्भद्रतरस्त्वया॥<br />And also having accomplished numerous daily rites from specific wishes, that king ultimately attained to a very desirable end. O Srinjaya, when even such a king suffered death, who was superior to you in all the four virtues.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>पुत्रात् पुण्यतरस्तुभ्यं मा पुत्रमनुतप्यथाः। अपज्वानमदाक्षिण्यमभि श्वैत्येत्युदाहरत्॥<br />And so was superior to your son, you should not lament for your son saying 'O Shvaitya' who performed no sacrifice and gave away no sacrificial presents.</p>
