<h3>None: Chapter 152</h3><h4>The commencement of a fresh battle</h4><p id='1'>संजय उवाच ततो दुर्योधनो राजा द्रोणेनैवं प्रचोदितः। अमर्षवशमापन्नो युद्धायैव मनो दधे॥<br />Sanjaya said Then king Duryodhana, thus addressed by Drona, directed his mind to battle influenced by rage.</p>
<p id='2'>अब्रवीच तदा कर्णं पुत्रो दुर्योधनस्तव। पश्य कृष्णसहायेन पाण्डवेन किरीटिना॥<br />Your son Duryodhana, then, spoke to Karna. "See that Kiriti, the son of Pandu with the help of Krishna.</p>
<p id='3'>आचार्यविहितं व्यूहं भित्त्वा देवैः सुदुर्भिदम्। तव व्यायच्छमानस्य द्रोणस्य च महात्मनः॥<br />Penetrated into the array drawn up by the preceptor, which (array) was difficult of being penetrated through even by the celestials themselves. Moreover, in the very presence of yourself and the high-souled Drona engaged in battle,</p>
<p id='4'>मिषतां योधमुख्यानां सैन्धवो विनिपातितः। पश्य राधेय पृथ्वीशाः पृथिव्यां प्रवरा युधि॥<br />And that of many other foremost warriors the king of Sindhu was killed. Behold, O son of Radha, many king-excellent warriors on earth.</p>
<p id='5'>पार्थेनैकेन निहताः सिंहेनेवेतरे मृगाः। मम व्यायच्छमानस्य द्रोणस्य च महात्मनः॥<br />Destroyed by Partha alone like numerous inferior beasts slain by a lion, even when the high-minded Drona and myself were fighting (in order to resist Arjuna).</p>
<p id='6'>अल्पावशेषं सैन्यं मे कृतं शक्रात्मजनेन ह। कथं नियच्छमानस्य द्रोणस्य युधि फाल्गुनः॥<br />My (once vast) army has been reduced to a handful of men only by the son of Shakra. How, when Drona was trying his utmost (to check him), could the Phalguna.</p>
<p id='7'>भिन्द्यात् सुदुर्भिदं व्यूहं यतमानोऽपि संयुगे। प्रतिज्ञाया गतः पारं हत्वा सैन्धवमर्जुनः॥<br />Arjuna fulfill his vow by killing the king of Sindhu? O hero, how could the son of Pandu, if Drona had not wished it.</p>
<p id='8'>पश्य राधेय पृथ्वीशान् पृथिव्यां पातितान् बहून्। पार्थेन निहतान् संख्ये महेन्द्रोपमविक्रमान्॥<br />Penetrate through that impenetrable array in battle when the latter was trying (to resist him). Indeed Phalguna is exceedingly dear to the high-souled preceptor.</p>
<p id='9'>अनिच्छतः कथं वीर द्रोणस्य युधि पाण्डवः। भिन्द्यात् सुदुर्भिदं व्यूह यतमानस्य शुष्मिणः॥<br />It is, on this account, that he allowed him to enter into the array) without offering any opposition to him. Behold my misery now; that tormentor of foes, Drona, first, promised protection to the king of Sindhu.</p>
<p id='10'>दयित: फाल्गुनो नित्यमाचार्यस्य महात्मनः। ततोऽस्य दत्तवान् द्वारमयुद्धेनैव शत्रुहन्।॥ अभयं सिन्धुराजाय दत्त्वा द्रोणः परंतपः। प्रादात् किरीटिने द्वारं पश्य निर्गुणतां मयि॥<br />(But) The afterwards allowed Kiriti to enter into the array. If he had before given permission to the king of Sindhu to return home, this dreadful havoc would never have taken place in battle. Jayadratha was for returning home in order to save his life.</p>
<p id='11'>यद्यदास्यदनुज्ञां वै पूर्वमेव गृहान् प्रति। प्रस्थातुं सिन्धुराजस्य नाभविष्यज्जनक्षयः॥ अद्य मे भ्रातरः क्षीणाश्चित्रसेनादयो रणे। भीमसेनं समासाद्य पश्यतां नो दुरात्मनाम्॥<br />But relaying upon the promise of protection made by Drona, insensate fool that I was, i stooped him. Today my brothers Chitrasena and others, have in the very sight of our wretched selves, been destroyed by Bhimasena.</p>
<p id='12'>कर्ण उवाच आचार्य मा विगर्हस्व शक्तयासौ युध्यते द्विजः। यथाबलं यथोत्साहं त्यक्त्वा जीवितमात्मनः॥<br />Karna said Do not blame the preceptor. (For) the twiceborn one is fighting to the best of his prowess and energy and heedless of his life.</p>
<p id='13'>यद्येनं समतिक्रम्य प्रविष्टः श्वेतवाहनः। नात्र सूक्ष्मोऽपि दोषः स्यादाचार्यस्य कथंचन॥<br />If Shetavahana entered (into the array) after having overcome him the preceptor cannot be found fault with in the least (for that).</p>
<p id='14'>कृती दक्षो युवा शूरः कृतास्रो लघुविक्रमः। दिव्यास्रयुक्तमास्थाय रथं वानरलक्षणम्॥<br />(Again, Arjuna) is accomplished, skillful, young, heroic, accomplished in arms and quick in movements. He was armed with celestial weapons and mounted on the ape-bannered car.</p>
<p id='15'>कृष्णेन च गृहीताश्वमभेद्यकवचावृतः। गाण्डीवमजरं दिव्यं धनुरादाय वीर्यमान्॥<br />The steeds of which were guided by Krishna. And that puissant one was clad in impenetrable armour and wielding his celestial and undecaying bow Gandiva.</p>
<p id='16'>प्रवर्षन् निशितान् बाणान् बाहुद्रविणदर्पितः। यदर्जुनोऽभ्ययाद् द्रोणमुपपन्नं हि तस्य तत्॥<br />As Arjuna, proud of the prowess of his arms, sent forth keen darts, it was no wonder that he over came Drona.</p>
<p id='17'>आचार्यः स्थविरो राजशीघ्रयाने तथाक्षमः। बाहुव्यायामचेष्टायामशक्तस्तु नराधिप।॥<br />(On the other hand), Oking, the preceptor is old and incapable of quick movements and o lord of men, (he is) also unable to exercise his arms (for a long time).</p>
<p id='18'>तेनैवमभ्यतिक्रान्तः श्वेताश्वः कृष्णसारथिः। तस्य दोषं न पश्यामि द्रोणस्यानेन हेतुना॥<br />It was on this account, that Setasva with Krishna as his charioteer was able to overcome him. I cannot, therefore, find any fault in Drona. are</p>
<p id='19'>दैवमत्र परं स्मृतम्। अजय्यान् पाण्डवान् मन्ये द्रोणेनासविदा मृधे। तथा ह्येनमतिक्रम्य प्रविष्टः श्वेतवाहनः॥<br />In my opinion the Pandavas unconquerable in battle by Drona, (however) skilled in weapons (he may be) in as much as Shetavahena, surpassing him, entered (into our array).</p>
<p id='20'>दैवादिष्टेऽन्यथाभावो नमन्ये विद्यते क्वचित्। यतो नो युध्यमानानां परं शक्त्या सुयोधन॥<br />My belief is that what is ordained by fate undergoes no alteration, when, O Suyodhana, in spite of our fighting to the very best of our power.</p>
<p id='21'>सैन्धवो निहतो युद्धे परं यत्नं कुर्वतां च त्वया सार्धं रणाजिरे॥<br />The king of Sindhu has been killed in battle. It seems that fate is supreme. Though we have been making vigorous exertions with you on the field of battle.</p>
<p id='22'>हत्वास्माकं पौरुषं वै दैवं पश्चात् करोति नः। सततं चेष्टमानानां निकृत्या विक्रमेण च॥<br />(And though he have been) always trying (to achieve success) by means of prowess and deceit, fate makes all our efforts futile.</p>
<p id='23'>दैवोपसृष्टः पुरुषो यत् कर्म कुरुते वचित्। कृतं कृतं हि तत्कर्म दैवेन विनिपात्यते॥<br />O king, whatever act, a person who is not favoured by fate, does, it is baffled by fate, in spite of all his exertions to accomplish it.</p>
<p id='24'>यत् कर्तव्यं मनुष्येण व्यवसायवता सदा। तत् कार्यमविशङ्केन सिद्धिदैवे प्रतिष्ठिता॥<br />That, which a person having perseverance ought to do, should be performed by him in a fearless spirit, (though of course) success depends upon fate.</p>
<p id='25'>निकृत्या वञ्चिताः पार्था विषयोगैश्च भारत। दग्धा जतुगृहे चापि द्यूतेन च पराजिताः॥<br />We beguiled the sons of Pritha by deceit as well as by administration of poison, O Bharata. They were (again) burnt in the lac house and defeated at dice.</p>
<p id='26'>निरर्थकम्। राजनीतिं व्यपाश्रित्य प्रहिताश्चैव काननम्। यत्नेन च कृतं तत्तद् दैवेन विनिपातितम्॥<br />In pursuance of state policy they were exiled to the forest; though we did all these with the utmost care, they have been frustrated by fate.</p>
<p id='27'>युध्यस्व यत्नमास्थाय दैवं कृत्वा यततस्तव तेषां च दैवं मार्गेण यास्यति॥<br />Hurling defiance at fate, fight with (utmost) care. Between yourself and themselves, fate will espouse the cause of the party that will make the best exertion.</p>
<p id='28'>न तेषां मतिपूर्वं हि सुकृतं दृश्यते क्वचित्। दुष्कृतं तव वा वीर बुद्ध्या हीनं कुरूद्वह॥<br />(It does not seem) that they (i.e., the Pandavas) have done anything good by reason of superior intellect; nor (does it appear) O hero, O perpetuator of Kuru-race you have done anything wrong through want of understanding.</p>
<p id='29'>दैवं प्रमाणं सर्वस्य सुकृतस्येतरस्य वा। अनन्यकर्म दैवं हि जागर्ति स्वपतामपि॥<br />It is fate that always bears testimony to our acts, whether good or evil. Fate which is (ever) bent on its purpose is wide awake even when everything else sleeps.</p>
<p id='30'>बहूनि तव सैन्यानि योधाश्च बहवस्तव। न तथा पाण्डुपुत्राणामेवं युद्धमवर्तत॥<br />When the war began your soldiers and warriors were more numerous than those of the sons of Pandu.</p>
<p id='31'>तैरल्पैर्बहवो यूयं क्षयं नीताः प्रहारिणः। शङ्के दैवस्य तत् कर्म पौरुषं येन नाशितम्॥<br />By their small force numerous warriors on your side have been destroyed. I fear it is the work of Destiny by which exertion has been baffled.</p>
<p id='32'>संजय उवाच एवं सम्भाषमाणानां बहु तत् तज्जनाधिप। पाण्डवानामनीकानि समदृश्यन्त संयुगे॥<br />Sanjaya said When, (monarch, they were thus conversing about many other (subjects) the army of the Pandavas was seen on the field of battle.</p>
<p id='33'>। ततः प्रववृते युद्धं व्यतिषक्तरथद्विपम्। तावकानां परैः सार्धं राजन् दुर्मन्त्रिते तव॥<br />Then, O monarch there ensued a furious encounter, the result of our evil policy, in which the infantry, cars and elephants of your party encountered those of the other.</p>
