<h3>PRATIJNA PARVA: Chapter 73</h3><h4>The oath of Arjuna</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच त्वयि याते महाबाहो संशप्तकबलं प्रति। प्रयत्नमकरोत् तीव्रमाचार्यो ग्रहणे मम॥<br />Yudhishthira said When, O mighty-armed one, you had gone against the Samshaptaka hosts, the preceptor Drona exerted himself vigourously for capturing me.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>व्यूढानीका वयं द्रोणं वारयामः स्म सर्वशः। प्रतिव्यूह्य स्थानीकं यतमानं तथा रणे॥<br />We then began to resist Drona and his troops arrayed in order on all sides, by dispensing off our troops and car divisions in counter array and striving hard.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>स वार्यमाणो रथिभिर्मयि चापि सुरक्षिते। अस्मानभिजगामाशु पीडयन् निशितैः शरैः॥<br />Though he was thus resisted by many and though I was well protected, yet he began to smite us with agility, afflicting us with his sharp shafts.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>ते पीड्यमाना द्रोणेन द्रोणानीकं न शक्नुमः। प्रतिवीक्षितुमप्याजौ भेत्तुं तत् कुत एव तु॥<br />My troops then, thus afflicted by Drona, were not even able, in battle, to look at his divisions what to speak of the thought of breaking through them!</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>वयं त्वप्रतिमं वीर्ये सर्वे सौभद्रमात्मजम्। उक्तवन्तः स्म तं तात भिन्ध्यनीकमिति प्रभो॥<br />Then we all, O sire, spoke to Subhadra's son, who was unequalled in his prowess, saying-'O lord, do you break through these divisions of the enemy.'</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>स तथा नोदितोऽस्माभिः सदश्व इव वीर्यवान्। असह्यपि तं भारं वोदुमेवोपचक्रमे॥<br />That highly puissant hero then thus urged on by ourselves, like a good horse, prepared himself to take that burden upon himself, however unbearable it might have been for him.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>स तवास्त्रोपदेशेन वीर्येण च समन्वितः। प्राविशत् तद्बलं बालः सुपर्ण इव सागरम्॥<br />Then that boy of tender years, endued with energy and possessed of the knowledge of weapons received from you, broke through that array, like Suparna entering into the ocean.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>तेऽनुयाता वयं वीरं सात्वतीपुत्रमाहवे। प्रवेष्टकामास्तेनैव येन स प्राविशच्चमूम्॥<br />Then we followed that hero in battle, that son of a daughter of the Satvata race, desirous of entering the hostile ranks even through the path he then opened for us.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>ततः सैन्धवको राजा क्षुद्रस्तात जयद्रथः। वरदानेन रुद्रस्य सर्वान् नः समवारयत्॥<br />Then alas, O sire, the puny ruler of the Sindhus, king Jayadratha resisted us all, through the virtue of a boon received from the god Rudra (Mahadeva).</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>ततो द्रोणः कृपः कर्णो द्रौणिः कौसल्य एव च। कृतवर्मा च सौभद्रं षड् रथाः पर्यवारयन्॥<br />Thereupon Drona, Kripa, Karna, Drona's son, the king of the Kosalas and Kritavarman-these six car-warriors surrounded the son of Subhadra.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>परिवार्य तु तैः सर्वैर्युधि वालो महारथैः। यतमानः परं शक्त्या बहुभिर्विरधीकृतः॥<br />Thus surrounded by all those mighty carwarriors in battle, that boy though striking to the best of his abilities, was deprived of the use of his car, by the tremendous odds he was fighting against.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>ततो दौःशासनिः क्षिप्रं तथा तैर्विरथीकृतम्। संशयं परमं प्राप्य दिष्टान्तेनाभ्ययोजयत्॥<br />Thus when Abhimanyu was deprived of the use of his car by those warriors, Dushasana's son, who himself was involved in great catastrophe, succeeded, as fate would have it, in making Abhimanyu see his end.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>स तु हत्वा सहस्राणि नराश्वरथदन्तिनाम्। अष्टौ रथसहस्राणि नव दन्तिशतानि च॥<br />Having slain thousands of men, steeds, carwarriors and tusked elephants and eight thousands car-warriors and nine hundred elephants.</p>

<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>ततः परमधर्मात्मा दिष्टान्तमुपजग्मिवान्। एतावदेव निवृत्तमस्माकं शोकवर्धनम्॥<br />That one of highly illustrious soul through Destiny, attained his own end. Thus everything that now burns us with grief, has taken place.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>स चैवं पुरुषव्याघ्रः स्वर्गलोकमवाप्तवान्। ततोऽर्जुनो वचः श्रुत्वा धर्मराजेन भाषितम्॥<br />That foremost of men has also in his way, ascended to paradise.” Sanjay Said-Thus Arjuna hearing the word spoken by the virtuous king Yudhishthira.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>हा पुत्र इति निःश्वस्य व्यथितोन्यपतद् भुवि। विषण्णवदनाः सर्वे परिवार्य धनंजयम्॥<br />And saying, O my son! and sighing like a furnace, fell down on the earth in great distress. Then every one present, with melancholy countenances sat surrounding Dhananjaya.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>नेत्रैरनिमिषैर्दीनाः प्रत्यवेक्षन् परस्परम्। प्रतिलभ्य ततः संज्ञा वासविः क्रोधमूच्छितः॥<br />And highly distressed they began to gaze vacantly at one another with winkless eyes. Then regaining his consciousness and burning with rage, the son of Vasava.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>कम्पमानो ज्वरेणेव निःश्वसंश्च मुहुर्मुहुः। पार्णि पाणौविनिष्पिष्य श्वसमानोऽश्रुनेत्रवान्॥<br />Shivering as if with fever and repeatedly sighing and squeezing his hands and drawing deep breaths and with eyes flooded with tears and rolling his eyes like one mad, said these</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>अर्जुन उवाच उन्मत्त इव विप्रेक्षन्निदं वचनमब्रवीत्। सत्यं वः प्रतिजानामि श्वोऽस्मि हन्ता जयद्रथम्। न चेद् वधभयाद् भीतो धार्तराष्ट्रान् प्रहास्यति॥<br />Arjuna said I tell you this for sooth that, tomorrow I will slay Jayadrath, provided that, afraid of being slain, he does not forsake the sons of Dhritarashtra.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>न चास्माशरणं गच्छेत् कृष्णं वा पुरुषोत्तमम्। भवन्तं वा महाराज श्वोऽस्मि हन्ता जयद्रथम्॥<br />Or seek our refuge or that of Krishna the foremost of all male being or that of yourself, O monarch. I will surely slay Jayadratha tomorrow.</p>

<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>रक्षमाणाश्च तं संख्ये ये मां योत्स्यन्ति केचन। अपि द्रोणकृपौ राजन् छादयिष्यामि ताञ्छरैः॥<br />Desirous of protecting him in battle whosoever shall fight with me, I will cover him, O king, with my arrows, be he Drona himself or Kripa.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>यद्येतदेवं संग्रामे न कुर्यां पुरुषर्षभाः। मा स्म पुण्यकृतां लोकान् प्राप्नुयां शूरसम्मतान्॥<br />O foremost of men, O best of heroes, if I do not do tomorrow in battle what I promise to do, then let me not ever attain to the regions which the righteous attain after death.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>ये लोका मातृहतॄणां ये चापि पितृघातिनाम्। गुरुदारगतानां ये पिशुनानां च ये सदा॥ साधूनसूयतां ये च ये चापि परिवादिनाम्। ये च निक्षेपहर्तृणां ये च विश्वासघातिनाम्॥ भुक्तपूर्वां स्त्रियं ये च विन्दतामघशंसिनाम्। ब्रह्मघ्नानां च ये लोका ये च गोघातिनामपि॥ पायसं वा यवान्नं वा शाकं कृसरमेव वा। संयावापूपमांसानि ये च लोका वृथाश्नताम्॥<br />Those regions which are allotted to those who ravish their own mothers, to those who slay their fathers, who violate their preceptor's beds and who are malicious; those regions which are reserved for those who harbour hatred against the righteous, who speak maliciously of others, who appropriate the wealth entrusted with them and who betray their trusts; those regions that are for them who abuse others' wives enjoyed by them before or for them that slay Brahmanas or for them that slaughter the kine or for them that drink payasas or eat food prepared from barley or herbs or articles prepared from milk, sesamum and rice and Pupas and other kinds of cakes or meat, without having first offered them to the gods.</p>
