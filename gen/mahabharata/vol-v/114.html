They are of active habits, well-built, strong-bodied and free from any disease. They are clad in cuirasses and wellequipped with offensive weapons. They are accomplished in the use of various weapons and are well practised in the exercise of all kinds of weapons.</p>

It teems with chariot and steeds, which though devoid of wings are still capable of moving through the air like the winged rangers of the sky.</p>

<p id='53'>न हि ते सुकृतं किंचिदादौ मध्ये च भारत। दृश्यते पृष्ठतश्चैव त्वन्मूलो हि पराजयः॥<br />As these incidents developed themselves, no good action was performed by you either in the beginning, in the middle or in the end, O Bharata. The defeat that can be anticipated now, is entirely owing to your fault.</p>

<p id='56'>आगच्छतस्तान् सहसा क्रुद्धरूपान् सहानुगान्। दधारैको रणे पाण्डून् कृतवर्मा महारथः॥<br />Then the mighty car-warrior Kritavarman, single-headed, received in that battle, the enraged Pandava troops who had been rushing to the battle with their followers.</p>
<p id='57'>यथोद्वत्तं वारयते वेला वै सलिलार्णवम्। पाण्डुसैन्यं तथा संख्ये हार्दिक्यः समवारयत्॥<br />Just as the banks resist the surging waves of the sea, so did the son of Hridika resist the Pandava troops in battle.</p>
<p id='58'>तत्राद्भुतमपश्याम हार्दिक्यस्य पराक्रमम्। यदेनं सहिताः पार्था नातिचक्रमुराहवे॥<br />Then we beheld the wonderful prowess of Hridika's son inasmuch as the united divisions of the Parthas were unable to bear him down in battle.</p>
<p id='59'>ततो भीमस्त्रिभिर्विद्धवा कृतवर्माणमाशुगैः। शङ्ख दध्मौ महाबाहुर्हर्पयन् सर्वपाण्डवान्॥<br />Thereupon the mighty-armed Bhima piercing Kritavarman with three swift-coursing arrows, blew his conch-shell, imparting thereby delight unto the Pandava troops.</p>

<p id='63'>पुनर्विव्याध विंशत्या सायकानां हसन्निव। कृतवर्मा ततो राजन् सर्वतस्तान् महारथान्॥ एकैकं पञ्चभिर्विद्धवा भीमं विव्याध सप्तभिः। धनुर्ध्वजं चास्य तथा रथाद् भूमावपातयत्॥<br />He then once more smilingly pierced him with twenty shafts. Thereupon, Oking, Kritavarman piercing each of these mighty carwarriors separately with five shafts, pierced Bhima with another seven shafts. Then he felled from the latter's car his standard and cutoff his bow.</p>
<p id='64'>अथैनं छिन्नधन्वानं त्वरमाणो महारथः। आजघानोरसि क्रुद्धः सप्तत्या निशितैः शरैः॥<br />Then that mighty car-warrior making haste and burning with rage, pierced Bhima whose bow had been severed, on the breast, with seventy sharp arrows.</p>
<p id='65'>स गाढविद्धो बलवान् हार्दिक्यस्य शरोत्तमैः। चचाल स्थमध्यस्थः क्षितिकम्पे यथाचलः॥<br />That hero (Bhima) endued with prowess, thus deeply pierced by the excellent shafts of Hridika's son, began to tremble in the terrace of his car, like a mountain shaking during an earthquake.</p>
<p id='66'>भीमसेनं तथा दृष्ट्वा धर्मराजपुरोगमाः। विसृजन्तः शरान् राजन् कृतवर्माणमार्दयन्॥<br />Beholding Bhima thus involved in a dangerous situation, O king, the Pandava warriors headed by Yudhishthira, began to afflict Kritavarman by shooting numerous arrows.</p>
<p id='67'>तं कथा कोष्ठकीकृत्य रथवंशेन मारिष। विव्यधुः सायकैईष्टा रक्षार्थ मारुतेर्पधे॥<br />Then impaling Kritavarman within a circle of chariots, the Pandava warriors, O sire, filled with delight, began to wound him with their arrows, out of a desire for rescuing the son of Maruta.</p>
<p id='68'>प्रतिलभ्य ततः संज्ञां भीमसेनो महाबलः। शक्तिं जग्राह समरे हेमदण्डामयस्मयीम्॥<br />Thereafter the highly puissant Bhimasena regaining his senses, grasped, in that battle, a dreadful lance of golden staff and iron head.</p>
<p id='69'>चिक्षेप च रथात् तूर्ण कृतवर्मरथं प्रति। सा भीमभुजनिर्मुक्ता निर्मुक्तोरगसंनिभा॥<br />Then he huried from his own car that lance at the car of Kritavarman, with great force. That lance hurled by the arm of Bhima and resembling a snake that had recently cast off its slough.</p>
<p id='70'>कृतवर्माणमभितः प्रजज्वाल सुदारुणा। तामापतन्ती सहसा युगान्ताग्निसमप्रभाम्॥<br />began to burn dreadfully as it coursed towards Kritavarman. Then as that lance, effulgent like the fire that appears at the end of a Yugu, was coursing swiftly towards.</p>
<p id='71'>द्वाभ्यां शराभ्यां हार्दिक्यो निजघान द्विधा तदा। सा छिन्ना पतिता भूमौ शक्तिः कनकभूषणा॥<br />The son of Hridika, he cut it in twain with a couple of arrows. That dart decked with golden ornaments, thus severed, fell down on the earth.</p>
<p id='72'>द्योतयन्ती दिशो राजन् महोल्केव नभश्चयुता। शक्तिं विनिहतां दृष्ट्वा भीमश्चुक्रोध वैभृशम्॥<br />And, O king, it there began to illumine the points of the compass like a mighty meteor dropping from the heavens. Thereat Bhima beholding his lance baffled, became excited to the highest pitch of fury.</p>
<p id='73'>ततोऽन्यद् धनुरादाय वेगवत् सुमहास्वनम्। भीमसेनो रणे क्रुद्धो हार्दिक्यं समवारयत्॥<br />Thereafter, taking up another bow of great toughness and emitting loud twang, the enraged Bhimasena in that battle began to resist the son of Hridika.</p>
<p id='74'>अथैनं पञ्चभिर्बाणैराजधान स्तनान्तरे। भीमो भीमबलो राजंस्त्व दुर्मत्रितेन च॥<br />Then, Oking, Bhima of awful prowess, pierced Kritavarman, on the centre of his breast, with five arrows. All this is the result of your wicked policy.</p>
<p id='75'>भोजस्तु क्षतसर्वाङ्गो भीमसेनेन मारिष। रक्ताशोक इवोत्फुल्लो व्यभ्राजत रणाजिरे॥<br />Then, O sire, the ruler of the Bhojas wounded on all parts of his body, appeared on the field of battle like a red Ashoka tree covered with blossoms.</p>

<p id='79'>शिखण्डी तु ततः क्रुद्धश्छिन्ने धनुषि सत्वरः। असिं जग्राह समरे शतचन्द्रं च भाखरम्॥<br />Thereupon on the severance of his bow, Sikhandin burning with rage and hastening as much as possible, took up a sword and a buckler decked with hundreds of moons.</p>
<p id='80'>भ्रामयित्वा महचर्म चामीकरविभूषितम्। तमसिं प्रेषयामास कृतवर्मरथं प्रति॥<br />Whirling that mighty sword decked with gold, Sikhandin hurled it at the chariot of Kritavarman.</p>
