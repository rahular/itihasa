<h3>ABHIMANYU-VADHA PARVA: Chapter 48</h3><h4>The fight of Abhimanyu</h4><p id='1'>संजय उवाच स कर्णे कर्णिना कर्णे पुनर्विव्याध फाल्गुनिः। शरैः पञ्चाशता चैनमविध्यत् कोपयन् भृशम्॥<br />Sanjaya said Once more did the son of Arjuna pierced Karna on his car, with barbed arrows and then for angering the latter, again pierced him with fifty shafts more.</p>
<p id='2'>प्रतिदिव्याध राधेयस्तावद्भिरथ तं पुनः। शरैराचितसर्वाङ्गो बह्वशोभत भारत॥<br />Thereupon Radha's son pierced him in return with as many arrows. Covered all over with arrows, O Bharata, he then looked exceedingly beautiful.</p>
<p id='3'>कर्णे चाप्यकरोत् क्रुद्धो रुधिरोत्पीडवाहिनम्। कर्णोऽपिविबभौशूरू शरैश्छिननोऽसृगाप्लुतः॥<br />Excited with wrath, Abhimanyu also caused Karna to be covered over with streams of blood; the heroic Karna also appeared beautiful being mangled with shaft-wounds and bathed in blood.</p>
<p id='4'>तावुभौ शरचित्राङ्गौ रुधिरेण समुक्षितौ। बभूवतुर्महात्मानौ पुष्पिताविव किंशुकौ॥<br />Then both those high-souled warriors, mangled with arrow-wounds and steeped in blood, appeared like two Kinshukas covered with blossom,</p>
<p id='5'>अथकर्णस्य सचिवान् षट् शूरूंचित्रयोधिनः। साश्वसूतध्वजरथान् सौभद्रो निजघान ह॥<br />Then Subhadra's son slew six of Karna's ministers all versed in various modes of warfare, together with their horses, charioteer, car and standards.</p>
<p id='6'>तथेतरान् महेष्वासान् दशभिर्दशभिः शरैः। प्रत्यविध्यदसम्भ्रान्तस्तदद्भुतमिवाभवत्॥<br />Then Abhimanyu fearlessly pierced the rest of the mighty car-warriors in return, with ten shafts each; that feat of his seemed exceedingly wonderful.</p>
<p id='7'>मागधस्य तथा पुत्रं हत्वा षड्भिरजिह्मगैः। साश्वं ससूतं तरुणमश्वकेतुमपातयत्॥<br />Thereafter having slain the son of the ruler of the Magadhas with six swift-coursing arrows, Abhimanyu felled the youthful Ashvaketu together with his horses and charioteer.</p>
<p id='8'>मार्तिकावतकं भोज ततः कुञ्जरकेतनम्। क्षुरप्रेण समुन्मथ्य ननाद विसृजशरान्॥<br />Next slaying with a sharp, horse-shoeheaded arrow, the Bhoja prince of Martikavata having the device of an elephant on his banner, the son of Arjuna sent up a tremendous war-cry and began to scatter his arrows on all sides.</p>
<p id='9'>तस्य दौःशासनिर्विद्ध्वाचतुर्भिश्चतुरो हयान्। सूतमेकेन विव्याध दशभिश्चार्जुनात्मजम्॥<br />Thereupon the son of Drona pierced his four horses with four arrows and charioteer with one shaft and then he pierced Arjuna's son with ten arrows.</p>
<p id='10'>ततो दौःशासनिं कार्पोिर्विद्ध्वा सप्तभिराशुगैः। संरम्भाद रक्तनयनो वाक्यमुच्चैरथाब्रवीत्॥<br />Thereafter Krishna's nephew having pierced Dushasana's son with ten swiftcoursing arrows, spoke these words at the top of his voice, with eyes red in rage.</p>
<p id='11'>पिता तवाहवं त्यक्त्वा गतः कापुरुषो यथा। दिष्ट्या त्वमपि जानीषे योद्धुं न त्वद्य मोक्ष्यसे॥<br />"Your father has fled from the battle like a veritable coward. It is fortunate that you know how to fight. But today you shall not escape me alive."</p>
<p id='12'>एतावदुक्त्वा वचनं कर्मारपरिमार्जितम्। नाराचं विससर्जास्मै तं द्रौणिस्त्रिभिराच्छिनत्॥<br />Having spoken only these words, he hurled at him a Naracha burnished by the forger himself.</p>
<p id='13'>तस्या निर्ध्वजं छित्त्वा शल्यं त्रिभिरताडयत्। तं शल्यो नवभिर्बाणैर्गापौरताडयत्॥ यसम्भ्रान्तवद् राजंस्तदद्भुतमिवाभवत्।<br />Then leaving alone the son of Drona, Arjuna's son struck Shalya with three arrows. Him Shalya pierced in return with nine shafts furnished with vulterine feathers, on the breast, like one not at all afraid. That feat appeared to be highly wonderful.</p>
<p id='14'>तस्या निर्ध्वजं छित्त्वा हत्वोभी पार्ष्णिसारथी॥ तं विव्याधायसैः षड्भिः सोपाक्रामद् स्थान्तरम्।<br />The son of Arjuna then cutting off his bow and slaying his two flank-supporters, pierced him with six iron-made shafts; and then Shalya ascended another chariot.</p>
<p id='15'>शजयं चन्द्रकेतुं मेघवेगं सुवर्चसम्॥ सूर्यभासं च पञ्चैतान् हत्वा विव्याध सौबलम्। तं सौबलस्त्रिभिर्विद्ध्वा दुर्योधनमथाब्रवीत्॥<br />Then having slain Satrunjaya, Chandraketu, Meghavega, Suvarchasam and Suryabhasa, he pierced the son of Subala. Subala then piercing him with three arrows, thus addressed Duryodhana-</p>
<p id='16'>सर्व एनं विमनीमः पुरैकैकं हिनस्ति नः। अथाब्रवीत् पुनर्दोणं कर्णो वैकर्तनो रणे।॥<br />'Let all of us united together, crush this one; for, fighting singly, he will slay us all. O king, with the assistance of Drona and Kripa and others, do you think out the means of slaying this one. Thereafter Vikartana's son Karna, addressing Drona said these words-</p>
<p id='17'>पुरा सर्वान् प्रमथाति बृह्यस्य वधमाशु नः। ततो द्रोणो महेष्वासः सर्वांस्तान् प्रत्यभाषत॥<br />"Tell us the means of his death, before he slays us all.” Thereupon the fierce bow-man Drona replied to them all saying-</p>
<p id='18'>अस्ति वास्यान्तरं किंचित् कुमारस्याथ पश्यत। अण्वष्यस्यान्तरं ह्यद्य चरतः सर्वतोदिशम्॥<br />"With all your watchfulness, have you been able to detect any weakness in this youthful prince? He is careering in all directions; yet has any of you been able to find out any laches in the prince?</p>
<p id='19'>शीघ्रतां नरसिंहस्य पाण्डवेयस्य पश्यता धनुर्मण्डलमेवास्य रथामार्गेषु दृश्यते॥ संदधानस्य विशिखाशीघ्रं चैव विमुञ्चतः।<br />Behold the lightness of hands of this son of Arjuna, this foremost of all men! In the course of his car-motion, only his bow drawn to a complete circle can be seen and not his arrows, so swiftly does he let them off!</p>
<p id='20'>आरुजन्नपि मे प्राणान् मोहयन्नपि सायकैः॥ प्रहर्षयति मां भूयः सौभद्रः परवीरहा। अति मां नन्दयत्येष सौभद्रो विचरन् रणे॥<br />Indeed this slayer of hostile heroes, this son of Subhadra is affording me great delight, though with his shafts he is afflicting my vital limbs and confounding my senses. This son of Subhadra careering through the field of battle, delights me greatly.</p>
<p id='21'>अन्तरं यस्य संरब्धा न पश्यन्ति महारथाः। अस्यतो लघुहस्तस्य दिशः सर्वा महेषुभिः॥ न विशेष प्रपश्यामि रणे गाण्डीवधन्वनः।<br />In as much as many mighty car-warriors inflamed with rage cannot detect any the slightest weakness in him. I do not find any very great difference between the wielder of the Gandiva bow and this one of great lightness of hands, filling the points of the compass with his mighty shafts.</p>
<p id='22'>अथ कर्णः पुनर्दोणमाहार्जुनिशराहतः॥ स्थातव्यमिति तिष्ठामि पीड्यमानोऽभिमन्युना।<br />Then once more Karna, afflicted with the arrows of Arjuna's son said to Drona "Afflicted sore by Abhimanyu, I am staying here, only because as a warrior, I should stay here.</p>
<p id='23'>तेजस्विनः : कुमारस्य शराः परमदारुणाः॥ क्षिण्वन्ति हृदयं मेऽद्य घोराः पावकतेजसः। तमाचार्योऽब्रवीत् कर्णं शनकैः प्रहसन्निव॥<br />The fierce and exceedingly dreadful darts, corroding like fire, of this very furious prince, are this day sucking my heart's strength in battle.” Then softly and with a smile the preceptor replied to Karna saying-</p>
<p id='24'>अभेद्यमस्य कवचं युवा चाशुपराक्रमः। उपदिष्टा मया चास्य पितुः कवचधारणा॥ तामेष निखिला वेत्ति ध्रुवं परपुरंजयः। शक्यं त्वस्य धनुश्छेत्तुं ज्यां च बाणैः समाहितैः।।२८<br />"O Karna! This Abhimanyu is faithful, his prowess is great and his armour is incapable of being penetrated into. I have taught the father of this hero, the diverse methods of wearing coats of mail; assuredly this subjugator of hostile fortresses, knows all those methods of wearing armours. But exerting yourself carefully, you can, with arrows cut-off his bow, his bowstring.</p>
<p id='25'>अभीषूश्च हयांश्चैव तथोभौ पार्ष्णसारथी। एतत् कुरु महेष्वास राधेय यदि शक्यते॥<br />The reins of his steeds and his two supporters of the flanks. O mighty bow-man, 0 son of Radha, if you are competent, then do all these.</p>
<p id='26'>अथैनं विमुखीकृत्य पश्चात् प्रहरणं कुरु। सधनुष्को न शक्योऽयमपि जेतुं सुरासुरैः॥<br />Then compelling him to turn his face away from the field, do you strike him from behind. As long as he wields the bow, he is incapable of being defeated even by all the Gods and the Asuras united together.</p>
<p id='27'>विरथं विधनुष्कं च कुरुष्वैनं यदीच्छसि। तदाचार्यवचः श्रुत्वा कर्णो वैकर्तनस्त्वरन्॥ अस्यतो लघुहस्तस्य पृषत्कैर्धनुराच्छिनत्। अश्वानस्यावधीद् भोजो गौतमः पार्णिसारथी॥<br />So if you can, deprive him of the use of his car and his bow.” Then, Vikartana's son, Karna, hearing those words of the preceptor quickly cut-off Abhimanyu's bow with his arrows, when the latter was light-handedly scattering his shafts. Then Kritavarman of the Bhoja race, slew his steeds and Kripa the son of Gautama dispatched his two flanksupporters.</p>
<p id='28'>शेषास्तु च्छिन्नधन्वानं शरवर्षैरवाकिरन्। त्वरमाणास्त्वराकाले विरथं षण्महारथाः॥ शरवर्षैरकरुणा बालमेकमवाकिरन्।<br />The rest covered him with arrowy showers, when he was deprived of the use of his bow. Then these six mighty car-warriors with great activity, when activity was so necessary, ruthlessly covered that young careless hero who was fighting with them single-handedly, with showers of arrows.</p>
<p id='29'>स च्छिन्नधन्वा विरथः स्वधर्ममनुपालयन्॥ खड्गचर्मधरः श्रीमानुत्पपात विहायसा।<br />Then that handsome hero whose car had been rendered useless and whose bow had been cut-off, grasping his sword and buckler and remembering his duty, jumped up into the sky.</p>
<p id='30'>मार्गः सकौशिकाद्यैश्च लाघवेन बलेन च॥ आर्जुनिर्व्यचरद् व्योम्नि भृशं वै पक्षिराडिव।<br />Exhibiting great prowess and great lightness, Arjuna's son roved in the air like the king of the birds, in various motions, known as Kaushika and others.</p>
<p id='31'>मय्येव निपतत्येष सासिरित्यूर्ध्वदृष्टयः॥ विव्यधुस्तं महेष्वासं समरे छिद्रदर्शिनः।<br />“With the sword in his hand he may fall upon me,'-thinking thus those mighty bowmen with their eyes up-turned and very watchful for finding Abhimanyu's weakness, began to pierce him.</p>
<p id='32'>तस्य द्रोणोऽच्छिनन्मुष्टौ खङ्गं मणिमयत्सरुम्॥ क्षुरप्रेण महातेजास्त्वरमाणः सपत्नजित्।<br />Then that conqueror of enemies, viz., Drona of mighty energy quickly cut-off the jeweldecked hilt of Abhimanyu's sword with a single shaft furnished with a horse-shoe-head.</p>
<p id='33'>राधेयो निशितैर्बाणैर्व्यधमच्चर्म चोत्तमम्॥ व्यसिचर्मेषुपूर्णाङ्गः सोऽन्तरिक्षात् पुनः क्षितिम्। आस्थितश्चक्रमुद्यम्य द्रोणं क्रुद्धोऽभ्यधावत॥<br />Then Radha's son also cut-off his excellent buckler with many sharp arrows. Then deprived of his sword and his shield he came down from the sky upon the ground, with all his limbs intact. Then raising a car-wheel, he furiously rushed against Drona.</p>
<p id='34'>स चक्ररेणूज्ज्वलशोभिताङ्गो बभावतीवोज्ज्वलचक्रपाणिः। रणेऽभिमन्युः क्षणमास रौद्रः स वासुदेवानुकृति प्रकुर्वन्॥<br />His person shining with the dust from the car-wheel and himself wielding the car-wheel in his upraised arm, Abhimanyu appeared highly beautiful and for a while imitating the son of Vasudeva, he became terrible fierce in that battle.</p>
<p id='35'>स्रुतरुधिरकृतैकरागवस्त्रो भ्रुकुटिपुटाकुटिलोऽतिसिंहनादः। पवस्थ्यगतो भृशं व्यराजत्॥<br />With his robes dyed with the blood flowing in profusion (from his wounds), with his brows formidable in consequence of the wrinkles thereon, himself sending up loud war-cries, that highly powerful Abhimanyu appeared superbly beautiful staying in the midst of those foremost of kings.</p>
