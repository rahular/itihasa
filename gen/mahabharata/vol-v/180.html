<p id='2'>तस्य तं तुमुलं शब्दं श्रुत्वा कुञ्जरकम्पनम्। तावकानां महाराज भयमासीत् सुदारुणम्॥<br />Those loud roars of his, capable of his making an elephant tremble, entering into the car of troops, struck a great panic to their hearts, O mighty monarch.</p>
<p id='3'>अलायुधविषक्तं तु भैमसेनि महाबलम्। दृष्ट्वा कर्णो महाबाहुः पञ्चालान् समुपाद्रवत्॥<br />Meanwhile the mighty-armed Karna, beholding the highly puissant son of Bhima engaged with Alayudha, rushed against the Panchalas.</p>
<p id='4'>दशभिर्दशभिर्बाणैर्वृष्टद्युम्नशिखण्डिनौ। दृढः पूर्णायतोत्सृष्टैर्बिभेद नतपर्वभिः॥<br />He proceeded against Dhristadyumna and Sikhandin, each with ten strong and straight shafts, shot from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch.</p>
<p id='5'>ततः परमनाराचैर्युधामन्यूत्तमौजसौ। सात्यकिं च रथोदारं कम्पयामास मार्गणैः॥<br />Thereafter with a group of other arrows, consisting of Narachas, & c., the son of Suta caused Yudhamanyu, Uttamanjas and the mighty car-warrior Satyaki to tremble.</p>
<p id='6'>तेषामप्यस्यतां संख्ये सर्वेषां सव्यदक्षिणम्। मण्डलान्येव चापानि व्यदृश्यन्त जनाधिप॥<br />The bows of all those warriors also, O king, engaged in shooting shafts right and left, were also seen incessantly to be deawn in a circle.</p>
<p id='7'>तेषां ज्यातलनिर्घोषो रथनेमिस्वनश्च ह। मेघानामिव धर्मान्ते बभूव तुमुलो निशि॥<br />In that night the sound of their palms and the twang of their bow-strings and the clatter of their car-wheels were so loud as to resemble and rumble of cloud at the end of summer.</p>
<p id='8'>ज्यानेमिघोषस्तनयित्नुमान् वै धनुस्तडिन्मण्डलकेतुशृङ्गः शरोघवर्षाकुलवृष्टिमांश्च संग्राममेघः च बभूव राजन्॥<br />Then, O monarch, that battle appeared to be a cloud of which the sound of car-clatter and bow-twang consisted the roar of thunder; the bows of warriors its flashes and showers of arrows it torrents of rain.</p>
<p id='9'>तदद्भुतं शैल इवाप्रकम्पो वर्षं महाशैलसमानसारः। विध्वंसयामास रणे नरेन्द्र वैकर्तनः शत्रुगणावमर्दी॥<br />O foremost of kings, then Vikartana's son Karna, that crusher of his foes, immovable like a hill and equal to a hill in personal proportions, destroyed that wonderful shower of arrows.</p>
<p id='10'>ततोऽतुलैर्वज्रनिपातकल्पैः शितैः शरैः काञ्चनचित्रपुङ्खः। शत्रून् व्यपोहत् समरे महात्मा वैकर्तनः पुत्रहिते रतस्ते॥<br />Then Vikartana's son, high-souled, ever devoted to the interests of your sons, began to slay his adversaries in that battle, with Tomaras, which, in their fall, resembled the thunder-bolt and also with sharp arrows furnished with variegated wings of gold.</p>
<p id='11'>संछिन्नभिन्नध्वजिनश्च केचित् केचिच्छरैरर्दितभिन्नदेहाः। केचिद् विसूता विहयाश्च केचिद् वैकर्तनेनाशु कृता बभूवुः॥<br />Some (of the enemy's host) then had their standards broken and torn; some had their bodies torn and mangled with sharp arrows. Some were deprived of their charioteers, some of their horses and some were soon maimed by Vikartana's son.</p>
<p id='12'>अविन्दमानास्त्वथ शर्म संख्ये यौधिष्ठिरं तं बलमभ्यपद्यन्। तान् प्रेक्ष्य भग्नान् विमुखोकृतांश्च घटोत्कचो रोषमतीव चक्रे॥<br />Getting no refuge, the Panchala host then fell back upon the division of Yudhishthira. Beholding these troops broken and compelled to turn away, Ghatotkacha then became excited to the highest pitch of fury.</p>
<p id='13'>आस्थाय तं काञ्चनरत्नचित्रं रथोत्तमं सिंहवत् संननादा वैकर्तनं कर्णमुपेत्य चापि विव्याध वज्रप्रतिमैः पृषत्कैः॥<br />Then mounting on his excellent car adorned with gold and gems, he began to roar like a lion. Thereafter approaching Vikartana's son Karna he pierced him with arrows resembling the bolt of Heaven itself,</p>
<p id='14'>तौ कर्णिनाराचशिलीमुखैश्च नालीकदण्डासनवत्सदन्तैः। वराहकर्णैः सविपाठशृङ्गैः क्षुरप्रवर्धेश्च विनेदतुः खम्॥<br />They both then covered the welkin with showers of barbed arrows, Narachas, Silimukhas, Nalikas, Dandas, Asanis. Vatsyadantas, Varahakarnas and broad-headed and razor-faced arrows and shafts pointed like horns.</p>
<p id='15'>तद् बाणधारावृतमन्तरिक्षं तिर्यग्गताभिः समरे रराज। सुवर्णपुङ्खज्वलितप्रभाभि विचित्रपुष्पाभिरिव स्रजाभिः॥<br />The welkin then, shrouded with that arrowy shower, appeared in consequence of these gold-winged shafts of burning effulgence flying straight through it, as if hung with festoons of beautiful flowers.</p>

None could then find any superiority of either of those two excellent heroes.</p>
<p id='17'>अतीव तचित्रमतुल्यरूपं बभूव युद्धं रविभीमसून्चोः। समाकुलं शस्रनिपातघोरं दिवीव रावशुमतोः प्रमत्तम्॥<br />The battle, that was thus fought between the sons of Surya and Bhima and in which showers of arrows were discharged, looked highly charming and presented almost of unequaled aspect like what is seen in the fierce encounter between Rahu and the sun in the heavens.</p>
<p id='18'>संजय उवाच घटोत्कचं यदा कर्णो न विशेषयते नृप। ततः प्रादुश्चकारोग्रमस्रमस्रविदां वरः॥<br />Sanjaya said When, o king, Ghatotkacha, that foremost of all wielders of weapons, found that could get no advantage over Karna he invoked into existence an exceedingly fierce weapon.</p>
<p id='19'>तेनास्रेणावधीत् तस्य रथं सहयसारथिम्। विस्थश्चापि हैडिम्बिः क्षिप्रमन्तरधीयत॥<br />Then with that weapon having at first slain Karna's steed, the Rakshasa next destroyed his driver. And then the son of Hidimba quickly rendered himself invisible even then and there,</p>
<p id='20'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच तस्मिन्नन्तर्हिते तूर्णं कूटयोधिनि राक्षसे मामकैः प्रतिपन्नं यत् तन्ममाचक्ष्व संजय॥<br />Dhritarashtra said When that Rakshasa, after fighting by underhand measures, had thus disappeared, O Sanjaya, describe to me what befell my troops then.</p>
<p id='21'>संजय उवाच अन्तर्हितं राक्षसेन्द्रं विदित्वा सम्प्राक्रोशन् कुरवः सर्व एव। कथं नायं राक्षस: कूटयोधि हन्यात् कर्णं समरेऽदृश्यमानः॥<br />Sanjaya said Then beholding the Rakshasa disappear, all the Kurus then exclaimed aloud Saying-"Appearing next to view, the Rakshasa, fighting by underhand means, will certainly slay Karna.”</p>
<p id='22'>ततः कर्णो लघुचित्रानयोधी सर्वा दिशः प्रावृणोद् बाणजालैः। न वै किञ्चत् प्रापतत् तत्र भूतं तमोभूते सायकैरन्तरिक्षे॥<br />Thereupon Karna, who was endued with extreme lightness in the use of diverse weapons, covered all the points of the compass with bis arrowy net-work. Then in consequence of the welkin being darkened by those showers of arrows, no creature could be seen distinguished.</p>
<p id='23'>नैवाददानो न च संदधाना न चेषुधीः स्पृश्यमानः कराग्रैः। अदृश्यद् वै लाघवात् सूतपुत्रः सर्वं बाणैश्छादयानोऽन्तरिक्षम्॥<br />So great was the lightness of hand displayed by the son of Suta that nobody could then mark when the touched his quiver with his fingers, when he placed his arrows on the bowstring and when he aimed and let them off. The whole welkin was then darkened with his shafts.</p>

We then beheld in the sky what appeared to be amass of red cloud resembling the terrible flames of a raging fire.</p>

<p id='29'>तां शक्तिपाषाणपरश्वधानां प्रासासिवज्राशनिमुद्गराणाम्। वृष्टिं विशालां ज्वलितां पतन्तीं कर्णः शरौधैर्न शशाक हन्तुम्॥<br />Shooting countless arrows Karna then failed to destroy that thick and blazing shower of lances, swords, clubs, mallets, thunderbolts Asains and axes.</p>

<p id='32'>हाहाकृतं सम्परिवर्तमान संलीयमानं च विषण्णरूपम्। ते त्वार्यभावात् पुरुषप्रवीराः पराङ्मुखा नो बभूवुस्तदानीम्॥<br />Cries of Alas and Oh then arose there; and the warriors with their cheerless expression indicted as if they were on the verge of ruin. But those foremost of men, inspired as they were with honorable sentiments, did not then leave the field with faces turned round.</p>
<p id='33'>तां राक्षसी भीमरूपां सुघोरां वृष्टिं महाशस्रमयी पतन्तीम्। दृष्ट्वा बलौघांश्च निपात्यमानान् महद् भयं तव पुत्रान् विवेश॥<br />Then beholding that immensely terrible and awful shower of weapons invoked into existence by the illusive energy of the Rakshasa and seeing their own troops felled incessantly by it, your sons were seized with a great panic.</p>

Hearing these disagreeable sounds, O king, your troops were greatly afflicted.</p>
