<h3>GHATOTKACHA VADHA PARVA: Chapter 183</h3><h4>The words of Krishna</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच एकवीरवधे मोघा शक्तिः सूतात्मजे यदा। कस्मात् सर्वान् समुत्सृज्य स तां पार्थे न मुक्तवान्॥<br />Dhritarashtra said If Suta's son had possessed such a Sakti as was sure to slay one hero, why then excepting all others, did he not hurl it at Pritha's son Arjuna.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>तस्मिन् हते हता हि स्युः सर्वे पाण्डवसृञ्जयाः। एकवीरवधे कस्माद् युद्धे न जयमादधे॥<br />Had Arjuna been slain by that Sakti, then all the Srinjayas and Pandavas also would have be slain. Indeed, if Phalguna could have been slain, then victory certainly would have been ours.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>आहूतो न निवर्तेयमिति तस्य महाव्रतम्। स्वयं मार्गयितव्यः स सूतपुत्रेण फाल्गुनः॥<br />"Challenged, I would never turn back" even this was the vow taken by Arjuna. The son of Suta should therefore have summoned Arjuna in battle.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>ततो द्वैरथमानीय फाल्गुनं शक्रदत्तया। जघान न वृषः कस्मात् तन्ममाचक्ष्व संजय॥<br />Tell me, O Sanjaya, why then Vrisha, summoning Arjuna to a single combat, did not slay the latter by means of the Sakti given him by Indra.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>नूनं बुद्धिविहीनश्चाप्यसहायश्च ते सुतः। शत्रुभिर्व्यसितः पापः कथं नु स जयेदरीन्॥<br />Surely my son is a fool and has not good counsellors also to guide him; that wretch is ever outwitted by the foe, how then can be hope to obtain victory over them?</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>या ह्यस्य परमा शक्तिर्जयस्य च परायणम्। सा शक्तिर्वासुदेवेन व्यंसिता च घटोत्कचे॥<br />That Sakti which was such a powerful weapon and on which rested his hopes of victory, also even that Sakti had been made futile by Vasudeva's son through Ghatotkacha.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>कुणेर्यथा हस्तगतं ह्रियेत् फलं बलीयसा। तथा शक्तिरमोघा सा मोघीभूता घटोत्कचे॥<br />As a fruit is snatched away from the hands of a cripple with withered arms by a powerful man, even so had that mortal Sakti, of Karna, been made futile by Krishna, through Ghatotkacha.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>स्तयोरभावे श्वपचस्य लाभ:। मन्ये विद्वन् वासुदेवस्य तद्वद् युद्धे लाभः कर्णहैडिम्बयोवै॥<br />Just as in a battle between a boar and a dog, the huntsman is the party to forfeit when either is slain, so, I think, O intelligent one, Vasudeva's son is to be party benefitted in that battle between Karna and Hidimva's son.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>घटोत्कचो यदि हन्याद्धि कर्ण परोलाभः स भवेत् पाण्डवानाम्। वैकर्तनो वा यदि तं निहन्यात् तथापि कृत्यं शक्तिनाशात् कृतं स्यात्॥<br />"If Ghatotkacha slays Karna in battle the Pandavas will be greatly benefitted; on the other hand, if Karna slay Ghatotkacha in battle there will be a great gain to the Pandavas because then Karna's Sakti will be useless."</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>इति प्राज्ञः प्रज्ञयैतद् विचिन्त्य घटोत्कचं सूतपुत्रेण युद्धे। अधातयद् वासुदेवो नृसिंहः प्रियं कुर्वन् पाण्डवानाहितं च॥<br />Thinking in this way and for doing what was agreeable to the Pandavas that foremost of men Vasudeva, endued with great wisdom, had caused Ghatotkacha to be slain by Karna in battle.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>संजय उवाच एतचिकीर्षित ज्ञात्वा कर्णस्य मधुसूदनः। नियोजयामास तदा द्वैरथे राक्षसेश्वरम्॥ घटोत्कचं महावीर्यं महाबुद्धिर्जनार्दनः। अमोघाया विघातार्थं राजन् दुर्मन्त्रिते तव॥<br />Sanjaya said Knowing perfectly well what Karna desired to do, the slayer of Madhu, the mighty armed Janaradana, O monarch ordered the foremost of the Rakshasas, viz., Ghatotkacha of puissant might to engage in a duel with Karna for rendering, O king, the latter's death-dealing Sakti fruitless. All this, O monarch, is the outcome of your wicked policy.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>तदैव कृतकार्या हि वयं स्याम कुरूद्वह। न रक्षेद् यदि कृष्णस्तं पार्थं कर्णान्महारणात्॥<br />Operpetuator of Kuru's race, we could then have surely been successful had not Karna.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>साश्वध्वजरथः संख्ये धृतराष्ट्र पतेद् भुवि। विना जनार्दनं पार्थो योगानीमीश्वरं प्रभूम्॥<br />O Dhritarashtra, Partha, with his horse, charioteer and standard, would have been completely destroyed in battle, had he been deprived of the aid of Jannardana, that lord of all yoga prowess.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>तैस्तैरुपायैर्बहुभी रक्ष्यमाणः च पार्थिवा जयत्यभिमुखः शत्रून् पार्थः कृष्णेन पालितः॥<br />Protected with various means and always defended by Krishna, Partha ever defeats his foes, encountering them.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>स विशेषात् त्वमोघायाः कृष्णोऽरक्षत पाण्डवम्। हन्यात् क्षिप्रं हि कौन्तेयं शक्तिर्वृक्षमिवाशनिः॥<br />Indeed, it was Krishna that rescued Pritha's son from that death dealing Sakti otherwise that weapon would have quickly consumed the son of Kunti like the bolt of Heaven destroying a tree.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच विरोधी च कुमन्त्री च प्राज्ञमानी ममात्मजः। यस्यैव समतिक्रान्तो वधोपायो जयं प्रति॥<br />Dhritarashtra said My son in quarrelsome; his counsellors are so many fools. He is proud of his wisdom. He has thus overlooked the certain means that have given him victory.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>स वा कर्णो महाबुद्धिः सर्वशस्त्रभृतां वरः। न मुक्तवान् कथं सूत ताममोघां धनंजये। १८॥<br />Why, O Suta, did not Karna of high intelligence that foremost of all wielders of weapons discharge that fatal Sakti at Dhananjaya?</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>तवापि समतिक्रान्तमेतद् गावल्गणे कथम्। एतमर्थं महाबुद्धे यत् त्वया नावबोधितः॥<br />Why, O Gavalgani's son, did you too forget this great object, since endued as you are with great intelligence, you did not remind Karna?</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>संजय उवाच दुर्योधनस्य शकुनेर्मम दुःशासनस्य च। रात्रौ रात्रौ भवत्येषा नित्यमेव समर्थना॥<br />Sanjaya said Indeed, every night, O monarch, this used to form the subject of deliberation among Duryodhana, Sakuni, Dushasana and myself.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>श्वः सर्वसैन्यान्युत्सृज्य जहि कर्ण धनंजयम्। प्रेष्यवत् पाण्डुपञ्चालानुपभोक्ष्यामहे ततः॥<br />O Karna, leaving alone the rest of the warriors do you slay Dhananjaya. After that we shall lord over the Panchalas and the Pandavas as if they were mere slaves.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>अथवा निहते पार्थं पाण्डवान्यतमं ततः। स्थापयेद् यदि वार्ष्णेयस्तस्मात्कृष्णो हि हन्यताम्॥२२<br />Or it may be that upon the fall of Pritha's son, he, of Vrishni's race, will appoint another among the Pandavas to act as the leader of them. Therefore let Krishna be slain.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>कृष्णो हि मूलं पाण्डूनां पार्थः स्कन्ध इवोद्गतः। शाखा इवेतरे पार्थाः पञ्चालाः पत्रसंज्ञिताः॥<br />Krishna is the root of the Pandavas, Partha is their risen trunk. The other sons of Pritha and the Panchalas are like their branches and leaves respectively.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>कृष्णाश्रयाः कृष्णबलाः कृष्णनाथाश्च पाण्डवाः। कृष्णः परायणं चैषां ज्योतिषामिव चन्द्रमाः॥<br />The Pandavas have Krishna for their shelter, Krishna for their strength and Krishna for their leader. Krishna is their main support like the moon of the constellations.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>तस्मात् पर्णानि शाखाश्च स्कन्धं चोत्सृज्य सूतज। कृष्णं हि विद्धि पाण्डूनां मूलं सर्वत्र सर्वदा॥<br />Therefore, O son of Suta, leave alone the leaves, the branches and the trunk of the Pandava tree. Know Krishna to be its root, ever and every where.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>हन्याद् यदि हि दाशार्ह कर्णो यादवनन्दनम्। कृत्स्ना वसुमती राजन् वशे तस्य न संशयः॥<br />(Thus indeed did we then speak to Karna). Had he slain the scion of the Dasharha race, that delighter of the Yadavas and in that case, the whole earth, O monarch, would certainly have come under your sway.</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>यदि हि स निहतः शयीत भूमौ यदुकुलपाण्डवनन्दनो महात्मा। ननु तव वसुधा नरेन्द्र सर्वा सगिरिसमुद्रवना वशं व्रजेत॥<br />If that illustrious delighter, of the Yadu race and of the Pandavas, had lain prostrate on the field being slain in battle then, O ruler of men, this earth certainly would have fallen under your sway together with all her mountains, forests and seas.</p>
<p id='27'><a href='#27'></a>सा तु बुद्धिः कृताप्येवं जाग्रति त्रिदशेश्वरे। अप्रमेये हृषीकेशे युद्धकालेऽप्यमुह्यत॥<br />We rose every morning with this resolution regarding that lord of the celestials, viz., Hrishikesha of infinite prowess. But at the time of battle we forgot our resolution.</p>
<p id='28'><a href='#28'></a>अर्जुनं चापि राधेयात् सदा रक्षति केशवः। न ह्येनमैच्छत् प्रमुखे सौतेः स्थापयितुं रणे॥<br />Keshava ever defends Kunti's son Arjuna. He never allowed Arjuna to expose himself before Suta's son in battle.</p>
<p id='29'><a href='#29'></a>अन्यांश्चस्मै रथोदारानुपास्थापयदच्युतः। अमोघां तां कथं शक्तिं मोघां कुर्यामिति प्रभो॥<br />That undeteriorating one even made other foremost of car-ivarriors confront Karna, thinking how that fatal Sakti of ours might be rendered futile by us, O master.</p>
<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>यश्चैवं रक्षते पार्थं कर्णात् कृष्णो महामनाः। आत्मानं स कथं राजन् न रक्षेत् पुरुषोत्तमः॥<br />When again the illustrious Krishna protected Pritha's son in this manner, why, O king, would not that foremost of kings protect his own self?</p>
<p id='31'><a href='#31'></a>परिचिन्त्य तु पश्यामि चक्रायुधमरिंदमम्। न सोऽस्ति त्रिषु लोकेषु यो जयेत जनार्दनम्॥<br />Upon mature thought, I see that there is no person in the three worlds who is able to defeat that subduer of foe viz., Janaraddana, that hero bearing the discus in hand.</p>
<p id='32'><a href='#32'></a>ततः कृष्णं महाबाहुं सात्यकिः सत्यविक्रमः। पप्रच्छ रथशार्दूल: कर्णं प्रति महारथः॥<br />Sanjaya said That foremost of car-warrior viz., Satyaki of prowess incapable of being baffled, asked</p>

<p id='34'><a href='#34'></a>श्रीवासुदेव उवाच दुःशासनश्च कर्णश्च शकुनिश्च ससैन्धवः। सततं मन्त्रयन्ति स्म दुर्योधनपुरोगमाः॥<br />Vasudeva said Dushasana, Karna, Sakuni the ruler of the Sindhus with Duryodhana at their head, had frequently held consultation about this subject.</p>

<p id='39'><a href='#39'></a>अहमेव तु राधेयं मोहयामि युधां वर। ततो नावासृजच्छक्तिं पाण्डवे श्वेतवाहने॥<br />O foremost of warriors, it was I who confounded the son of Radha, in consequence whereof he did not hurl that Satki at the son of Pandu owning white steeds.</p>
