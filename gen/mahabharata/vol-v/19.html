<p id='2'>चोदयाश्वान् हृषीकेश संशप्तकगणान् प्रति। नैतै हास्यन्ति संग्रामं जीवन्त इति मे मतिः॥<br />'O Hrishikesha urge my steeds against this host of the Samshaptakas. I think they will not give up the battle so long life will be extant in them.</p>
<p id='3'>पश्यमेऽस्त्रबलं घोरं बाहोरिष्वसनस्य च। अद्यैतान् पातयिष्यामि क्रुद्धो रुद्रः पशूनिव॥<br />Behold, today, the terrible prowess of my two arms as also that of my bow. This day I will slay them, like Rudra slaying creatures (at the time of the universal annihilation).'</p>
<p id='4'>ततः कृष्णः स्मितं कृत्वा प्रतिनन्द्य शिवेन तम्। प्रावेशयत दुर्धर्षो यत्र यत्रैच्छदर्जुनः॥<br />Thereupon Krishna smiling and greeting the invincible Arjuna with auspicious words, pushed in the chariot where-so-ever the latter desired it to go.</p>
<p id='5'>स रथो भ्राजतेऽत्यर्थमुह्यमानो रणे तदा। उह्यमानमिवाकाशे विमानं पाण्डुरैर्हयैः॥<br />That chariot, borne in that battle by white steeds, appeared excessively effulgent, like a celestial car borne through the firmament.</p>
<p id='6'>मण्डलानि ततश्चक्रे गतप्रत्यागतानि च। यथा शक्ररथो राजन् युद्धे देवासुरे पुरा॥<br />O monarch, like the chariot of Shakra in the battle between the gods and the Asuras in the days of yore, that car moved in circular, backward and forward motions.</p>
<p id='7'>अथ नारायणाः कुद्धा विविधायुधपाणयः। क्षादयन्तः शरव्रातैः परिववर्धनंजयम्॥<br />Then the Narayana soldiers inflamed with rage and holding various weapons in their hands, encompassing Dhananjaya, covered him with showers of arrows.</p>

Thereupon thousands of separate forms (of Arjuna and Vasudeva) started into existence there.</p>
<p id='12'>आत्मनः प्रतिरूपैस्तैर्नानारूपैर्विमोहिताः। अन्योन्येनार्जुनं मत्वा स्वमात्मानं च जजिरे॥<br />Confounded by the various images of Arjuna's self, they fell to slay one another each considering the other to be Arjuna himself.</p>

<p id='22'>तस्य तद् भाषितं श्रुत्वा त्वरमाणो धनंजयः। वायव्यास्त्रेण तैरस्तां शरवृष्टिमपाहरत्॥<br />Hearing those words of his (Krishna's), Dhananjaya quickly dispelled that arrowy shower poured by the enemy, by means of the Vavabha weapon.</p>
<p id='23'>ततः संशप्तकवातान् साश्वद्विपरथायुधान्। उवाह भगवान् वायुः शुष्कपर्णचयानिव॥<br />Then the almighty Vayu blew away hosts of the Samshaptakas consisting of steeds elephants, chariots and weapons like heaps of dry leafs.</p>
