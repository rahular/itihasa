<h3>None: Chapter 36</h3><h4>The display of Abhimanyu's prowess</h4><p id='1'>संजय उवाच सौभद्रस्तद् वचः श्रुत्वा धर्मराजस्य धीमतः। अचोदयत यन्तारं द्रोणानीकाय भारत॥<br />Sanjaya said The son of Subhadra, having heard the words of the intelligent king Yudhishthira commanded his charioteer to drive his chariot against the army of Drona.</p>
<p id='2'>तेन संचोद्यमानस्तु याहि याहीति सारथिः। प्रत्युवाच ततो राजन्नभिमन्युमिदं वचः॥<br />Thus commanded by him with the words "Proceed, proceed", the charioteer, o king, then replied to Abhimanyu saying-</p>
<p id='3'>अतिभारोऽयमायुष्मन्नाहितस्त्वयि पाण्डवैः। सम्प्रधार्य क्षणं बुद्ध्या ततस्त्वं योद्भुमर्हसि॥<br />"Heavy is the burden, O long-lived one, that has today been placed on you by the Pandavas. Ascertaining by your judgment as to whether you have the strength to bear it or not, you should engage in the fight.</p>
<p id='4'>आचार्यो हि कृती द्रोणः परमास्त्रे कृतश्रमः। अत्यन्तसुखसंवृद्धस्त्वं चायुद्धविशारदः॥<br />The preceptor Drona, by continued labours, has acquired the excellent weapons and he is an adept in the art of warfare. You, on the other hand, have been brought up in all luxury and are unaccustomed to the toils and severities of fight.”</p>
<p id='5'>ततोऽभिमन्युः प्रहसन सारथिं वाक्यमब्रवीत्। सारथे को न्वयं द्रोणः समग्र क्षत्रमेव वा॥<br />Thereupon Abhimanyu, with a a smile, replied to his charioteer saying-"O charioteer, who is indeed this Drona? What avails all this vast host of the Kshatriyas?</p>
<p id='6'>ऐरावतगतं शक्रं सहामरगणैरहम्। अथवा रुद्रमीशानं सर्वभूतगणार्चिता। योधयेयं रणमुखे न मे क्षत्रेऽद्य विस्मयः॥<br />I would engage even with Indra on the back of his elephant Airavata and attended by the complete host of the immortals. I do not care anything for all this Kshatriyas today,</p>
<p id='7'>न ममैतद् द्विषत्सैन्यं कलामर्हति षोडशीम्। अपि विश्वजितं विष्णुं मातुलं प्राप्य सूतज॥ पितरं चार्जुनं युद्धे न भीर्मामुपयास्यति।<br />This host of the enemy is not competent to fight even with the sixteenth part of myself. Getting, O son of a driver, my uncle (maternal), the world-conquering Vishnu or my father, for my antagonist in battle, I will not this day be overcome with terror."</p>
<p id='8'>अभिमन्युश्च तां वाचं कद कृत्य सारथः॥ याहीत्येवाब्रवीदेन द्रोणानीकाय मा चिरम्।<br />Thereafter Abhimanyu seeing at naught those words of his charioteer commanded him saying-"Quickly drive towards the division of Drona."</p>
<p id='9'>तत: संनोदयामास हयानाशु त्रिहायनान्॥ नातिहष्टमनाः सूतो हेमभाण्डपरिच्छदान्॥<br />Then the charioteer with a heart scarcely cheerful, urged on his steeds, three years of age and decked with caparisons of gold.</p>
<p id='10'>ते प्रेषिताः सुमित्रेण द्रोणानीकाय वाजिनः॥ द्रोणमीयद्रवन् राजन् महावेगपराक्रमम्।<br />Then urged on towards the army of Drona by Sumitra, those steeds, endued with great fleetness and, prowess, rushed, O king, against Drona himself.</p>
<p id='11'>तमुदीक्ष्य तथाऽऽयान्तं सर्वे द्रोणपुरोगमाः। अभ्यवर्तन्त कौरव्याः पाण्डवाश्च तमन्वयुः॥<br />Beholding Abhimanyu thus advance, all the warriors, headed by Drona, of the Kaurava host, advanced to meet him who was on the other hand followed by the Pandavas.</p>
<p id='12'>स कर्णिकारप्रवरोच्छ्रितध्वजः सुवर्णवर्मार्जुनिरर्जुनाद् वरः। युयुत्सया द्रोणमुखान् महारथान् समासदसिंहशिशुर्यथा द्विपान्॥<br />Then like a young lion falling upon a herd of elephants, the son of Arjuna equal to Arjuna in prowess, owning an excellent standard bearing the device of a Karanikara tree, clad in fine coats of mail, fearlessly rushed against Drona, out of a desire for battle.</p>
<p id='13'>ते विंशतिपदे यत्ताः सम्प्रहारं प्रचक्रिरे। आसीद् गाङ्ग इवावर्तो मुहूर्तमुदधाविव॥<br />Filled with delight, the warriors of Drona's division began to strike Abhimanyu as he strove to break through their ranks. Then for a moment only there reigned a confusion, that resembled the eddy that produced there where the Ganges stream flows into the waters of the ocean.</p>
<p id='14'>शूराणां युध्यमानानां निघ्नतामितरेतरम्। संग्रामस्तुमुलो राजन् प्रावर्तत सुदारुणः॥<br />Then as the heroes fought on and slew one another, O king, there commenced a pell-mell and awful fight.</p>
<p id='15'>प्रवर्तमाने संग्रामे तस्मिन्नतिभयंकरे। द्रोणस्य मिषतो व्यूह भित्त्वा प्राविशदार्जुनिः॥<br />When that awful conflict raged fiercely, the son of Arjuna breaking through the enemies' array entered it even before the very eyes of Drona himself.</p>
<p id='16'>तं प्रविष्टं विनिघ्नन्तं शत्रुसंधान् महाबलम्। हस्त्यश्वरथपत्त्यौघाः परिवQरुदायुधाः॥<br />Then large bodies of elephant-riders, horsemen, car-warriors and foot-soldiers, all delighted, surrounded that mighty hero who penetrating into the enemies ranks, had already began to smite them down.</p>
<p id='17'>नानावादिनिनदैः क्ष्वेडितोत्कृष्टगर्जितैः। हुंकारैः सिंहनादैश्च तिष्ठ तिष्ठति नि:स्वनैः॥<br />With the sound of various musical instruments, with shouts and slappings of armpits and war-cries, with yells, leonine roars, with cries of 'Slay, slay.'</p>
<p id='18'>थोरैहलहलाशब्दैर्मा गास्तिष्ठेहि मामिति। असावहममुत्रेति प्रवदन्तो मुहुर्मुहुः॥<br />With a dreadful and confused din, with exclamation of Do not go, Stop, Come to me, with repeated voices saying, Here am I, come.</p>
<p id='19'>बृहितः सिंजितैर्हासैः करनेमिस्वनैरपि। संनादयन्तो वसुधामभिदुद्रुवुरार्जुनिम्॥<br />With roars of elephants, with the tinkling of ornaments, with roars of laughter, with the clatter of car-wheels and horse-hoofs, filling the earth with all these sounds, the Kauravas warriors assailed the son of Arjuna.</p>
<p id='20'>धामापततां वीरः शीघ्रयोधी महाबलः। क्षिणास्त्रो न्यवधीट् राजन् मर्मज्ञो मर्मभेदिभिः॥<br />That hero endowed with great lightness in discharging weapons and possessed of the knowledge of the vital parts of the body, swiftly and firmly shooting arrows capable of penetrating the very vitals, began to slaughter those advancing warriors of the enemy.</p>
<p id='21'>न्यमाना विवशा नानालिङ्गैः शितैः शरै. पेतुः सुबहुशः शलभा इव गावकम्॥<br />Though thus slaughtered by diverse shafts of exceeding sharpness and rendered quit helpless, yet they, in that battle, fell upon Abhimanyu like fights of insects failing upon fire.</p>
<p id='22'>ततस्तेषां शरीरैश्च शरीरावयवैश्च सः। तस्तार क्षिति क्षिप्रं कुशैर्वेदिमिवाध्वरे॥<br />Then with their bodies and their severed parts, Abhimanyu covered the earth like a priest covering the alter with Kusha-grass during a sacrifice.</p>
<p id='23'>बद्धगोधाङ्गुलित्राणान् सशरासनसायकान्। सासिचाङ्कुशाभीषून् सतोमरपरश्वधान्॥ शादायोगुडआसान् सर्टितोमरपट्टिशान्। सभिन्दिपालपरिधान् सशक्तिवरकम्पनान्॥ सनतोदमहाशवान् सकुन्तान् सकचग्रहान्। समुद्गरक्षेपणीयान् सपाशपरिघोपलान्॥ सकेयूराङ्गदान बाहून् ह्यगन्धानुलेपनान्। संचिच्छेदा निस्तूर्णं त्वदीयानां सहस्रशः॥<br />Then Arjuna's son quickly lopped off by thousands the arms of your warriors; some of these arms were protected with gloves made of iguana skin, some held bows and shafts, some grasped swords or bucklers or iron hooks and reins, some held lances and axes; some clutched maces or iron ball or spears. Some had in their grasps scimitars or crows or battleaxes; some held short darts or shafts of Kampanas; some held goads and huge conchshells, wielded piked lances and Kachagrahas, some had mallets or other kinds of missiles; some had nooses, some heavy clubs and brick-bats. All of these arms again were ornamented with bracelets and bangles and smeared with fragrant perfumes and unguents.</p>
<p id='24'>तैः स्फुरद्भिर्महाराज शुशुभे भूः सुलोहितः। पज्ञास्यैः पन्नगेश्छिन्नैर्गरुडेनेव मारिष॥<br />Then covered with those effulgent arms a!! bathed in the crimson laid, the field, sire, 0 mighty monarch, appeared as if strewn over with five-headed serpents torn io pieces by Garuda.</p>
<p id='25'>सुनासाननकेशान्तरखणैश्चारुकुण्डलैः। संदष्टौष्ठपुटैः क्रोधात् क्षरद्भिः शोणितं बहु॥ स चारुमुमुटोष्णीधैर्मणिरत्नविभूषितैः। विनालनलिनाकारैर्दिवाकरशशिप्रभैः॥ हितप्रियंवदैः काले बहुभिः पुण्यगन्धिभिः । द्विषच्छिरोभिः पृथिवीं स वैतस्तार फाल्गुनिः॥<br />Then Phalugna's son spread the earth with the severed heads of the enemy-heads graced with beautiful noses and countenances and tresses of hair and without blotches and adorned with ear-rings; heads from which blood flowed copiously and in which the nether lips were bit in anger; heads that appeared like lotuses severed from their stems, owing to their being decked with beautiful garlands and tiaras and turbans and pearls and gems and owing to their being possessed of the splendour of the sun or the moon; heads that laved with fragrant perfumes could speak sweet and salutary words, when the vital spark was in them.</p>
<p id='26'>गन्धर्वनगराकारान् विधिवत् कल्पितान् रथान्। वोषामुखान् द्वित्रिवेणून् न्यस्तदण्डकबन्धुरान्॥ विजङ्घाकूबरांस्तत्र विनेमिदशनानपि। विचक्रोपस्करोपस्थान् भग्नोपकरणानपि॥ प्रपातितोपस्तरणान् हतयोधान् सहस्रशः। शरैर्विशकलीकुर्वन् दिक्षु सर्वास्वदृश्यत॥<br />Then, O Bharata, Arjuna's son careered in all directions over the field, having shattered with his arrows, cars, equipt with all the necessaries of war and looking like the vapoury edifices in the air having shafts in front and excellent bamboo poles and looking beautiful with standards mounted on them. They were all deprived of their fanghas, axels, perriferries and Dascias, wheels, standards and terraces; the implements of war in them were all splintered into pieces; the precious clothes that covered them were all blown away and warriors on those cars, were slain by thousands.</p>
<p id='27'>पुनर्द्विपान् द्विपारोहान् वैजयन्त्यङ्कुशध्वजान्! तूणान् वर्माण्यथोकक्ष्यावेयांश्च सकम्बलान्॥ घण्टाः शुण्डाविषाणाग्रान छत्रमाला: पदानुगान्। शरैर्निशितधारागः शात्रवाणामशातयत्॥<br />Then again with arrows of keen points and edges he cut down the enemy's elephants, with their riders, standards hooks, banners, quivers, armours, girths, neck-ropes, caparisons, blankets, bells, trunks; and also the footsoldiers that guarded those elephants from the back.</p>
<p id='28'>वनायुजान् काम्बोजानथ बालिकान्। स्थिरबालधिकर्णाक्षाञ्जवनान् साधुवाहिनः॥ आरूढाशिक्षितैर्योधैः शक्त्यष्टिप्रासयोधिभिः। विध्वस्तचामरमुखान् विप्रविद्धप्रकीर्णकान्॥ निरस्तजिह्वानयनान् निष्कीर्णान्त्रयकृद्धानान्। हतरोहांश्छिन्नघण्टान् क्रव्यादगणमोदकान्॥ निकृत्तचर्मकवचाशकृन्मूत्रासृगाप्लुतान्। निपातयन्नश्ववरांस्तावकान् स व्यरोचत॥<br />Numerous steeds of the Vanayu the Lilly, the Kamboja and the Balhika breed with tails, ears and eyes fixed and motionless, endued with great fleetness, well-broken, ridden by accomplished warriors armed with swords and spears, were seen to be deprived of the fine ornaments of their heads as also of their fine tails; they were deeply pierced and lay covering the field. Their tongues and their eyes were fixed and their livers and entrails were drawn out; their riders had been slain; their bells torn and they enhanced the delight of flesh-eating animals. Their armours and other leathern fences were cut open and they lay weltering in the urine and excreta they themselves had discharged. Thus slaughtering your steeds steeds and elephants, Abhimanyu appeared highly beautiful.</p>
<p id='29'>एको विष्णुरिवाचिन्त्यं कृत्वा कर्म सुदुष्करम्। तथा निर्मथितं तेन त्र्यहं तव बलं महत्॥<br />Achieving, single-handed, these mosi difficult of feats, like the incomprehensible Vishnu in the days of old, Abhimanyu crushed your army consisting of three kinds of forces.</p>
<p id='30'>यथासुरबलं घोरं त्र्यम्बकेण महौजसा। कृत्वा कर्म रणेऽसह्यं परैरार्जुनिराहवे॥<br />Even like the three-eyed Deity of infinite prowess crushing the Asura host. In that battle, the son of Arjuna having achieved feats incapable of being achieved by the enemy.</p>
<p id='31'>अभिनच्च पदात्योघांस्त्वदीयानेव सर्वशः। एवमेकेन तां सेना सौभद्रेण शितैः शरैः॥ भृशं विप्रहतां दृष्ट्वा स्कन्देनेवासुरी चमूम्। त्वदीयास्तव पुत्राश्च वीक्षमाणा दिशो दश॥<br />Began to break through your infantry divisions on all sides. Thus the beholding the army mangled with sharp arrows of the singlehanded son of Subhadra like the army of the Asuras mangled by Skanda, your sons looked vacantly at all the ten points of the compass.</p>

Desponding to conquer their antagonist, they exerted themselves in flying away from the field.</p>
<p id='33'>गोत्रनामभिरन्योन्यं क्रन्दन्तो जीवितैषिणः। हतान् पुत्रान् पितॄन् भ्रातृन् बन्धून् संबन्धिनस्तथा॥४५ प्रातिष्ठन्त समुत्सृज्य त्वरयन्तो हयद्विपान्॥<br />Desirous of saying their lives, they called out one another by their appellation and family-names.
