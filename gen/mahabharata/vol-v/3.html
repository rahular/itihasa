Seeing that one who was always like an island to persons going down into the unfathomable deep in their attempt to cross it; seeing him pierced with shafts that had flown in an uninterrupted stream like that of the Yamuna, hiin who appeared like the unbearable Menaka hurled on the earth by Mahendra; seeing that hero fallen on the surface of the earth like the sun dropped down from the heavens; seeing him who resembled the unconquerable Vritra when he had been vanquished in the days of yore by Vasava; seeing that stupifier of the consciousness of all heroes, that most excellent of champions, that foremost of all bowmen; seeing that hero an foremost of men, your father Bhishma of illustrious vows, that grandsire of the descendant of the Bharatas thrown down and lying prostrate on the field, pierced through and through by the arrows of Arjuna; seeing that hero resting on a couch worthy of a hero-the son of Adhiratha dismounted from his chariot, greatly distressed and overwhelmed with grief and with his consciousness well-nigh clouded.</p>
