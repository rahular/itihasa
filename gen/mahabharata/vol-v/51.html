<h3>None: Chapter 51</h3><h4>The lamentations of Yudhishthira</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>संजय उवाच हते तस्मिन् महावीर्ये सौभद्रे रथयूथपे। विमुक्तस्थसंनाहाः सर्वे निक्षिप्तकार्मुकाः॥ उपोपविष्टा राजानं परिवार्य युधिष्ठिरम्। तदेव युद्धं ध्यायन्तः सौभद्रगतमानसाः॥<br />Sanjaya said When that hero that leader of a car-division viz., Subhadra's son had been slain in battle, leaving their cars and doffing their coats of mail and throwing aside their bows, all the Pandavas sat surrounding king Yudhishthira. They were then brooding upon their grief with their hearts occupied with the thought of the deceased son of Subhadra.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>ततो युधिष्ठिरो राजा विललाप सुदुःखितः। अभिमन्यौ हते वीरे भ्रातुः पुत्रेमहारथे॥<br />Then upon the death of the brother's son, the heroic and mighty car-warrior Abhimanyu, king Yudhishthira began to lament totally unmanned by grief.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>द्रोणानीकमसम्बाधं मम प्रियचिकीर्षया। भित्त्वा व्यूहं प्रविष्टोऽसौ गोमध्यमिव केसरी॥<br />Desirous of doing an act agreeable to me, he (Abhimanyu) penetrated the array of Drona with the least difficulty, like a lion penetrating into the midst of a herd of kine.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>यस्य शूरा महेष्वासाः प्रत्यनीकगता रणे। प्रभग्ना विनिवर्तन्ते कृतास्त्रा युद्धदुर्मदाः॥<br />Meeting with him in battle, fierce bowmen, endowed with heroism, accomplished in the use of weapons and incapable of being easily defeated in battle, were compelled to turn back.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>अत्यन्तशत्रुरस्माकं येन दुःशासनः क्षिप्रं ह्यभिमुखः संख्ये विसंज्ञो विमुखीकृतः॥<br />Our implacable enemy Dushasana having encountered him in battle, was quickly compelled by his shafts to retreat, being nearly deprived of his senses.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>स तीर्खा दुस्तरं वीरो द्रोणनीकमहार्णवम्। प्राप्य दौःशासनिं कार्णिः प्राप्तो वैवस्वतक्षयम्॥<br />Having crossed the ocean-like host of Drona's troops difficult of being defeated, that nephew of Krishna was despatched to Death's mansion, upon encountering the son of Dushasana.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>कथं द्रक्ष्यामि कौन्तेयं सौभद्रे निहतेऽर्जुनम्। सुभद्रां वा महाभागां प्रियं पुत्रमपश्यतीम्॥<br />Oh, now that Abhimanyu is slain, how shall I look upon Kunti's son Arjuna or upon the auspicious Subhadra bereft of her that dearloved son!</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>किंस्विद् वयमपेतार्थमश्लिष्टमसमञ्जसम्। तावुभौ प्रतिवक्ष्यामो हृषीकेशधनंजयौ॥ शरैः।<br />What meaningless, disjointed and incoherent words shall we have to say today to both Hrishikesha and Dhananjaya!</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>अहमेव सुभद्रायाः केशवार्जुनयोरपि। प्रियकामो जयाकाक्षी कृतवानिदमप्रियम्॥<br />It is myself, desirous of my own good and intent on victory, that have done this injury to Subhadra, Arjuna and Keshava!</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>न लुब्धो बुध्यते दोषाँ ल्लोभान्मोहात् प्रवर्तते। मधुलिप्सुर्हि नापश्यं प्रपातमहमीदृशम्॥<br />A covetous man never finds his own shortcomings; and it is from folly, that covetousness proceeds. Desirous of collecting the honey, I could not see that such a fall threatened me.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>यो हि भोज्ये पुरुकार्यो यानेषु शयनेषु च। भूषणेषु च सोऽस्माभिर्बालो युधि पुरस्कृतः॥<br />He who was a mere boy and who should have been indulged with good food, conveyance, beds and ornaments, alas, even such a boy was placed by us in the thick of battle!</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>कथं हि बालस्तरुणो युद्धानामविशारदः। सदश्व इव सम्बाधे विषमे क्षेममर्हति॥<br />Like a steed of spirited mettle that sacrifices itself rather than obey the reins, how could that boy of tender years, unskilled in the modes of warfare reap good in such a perilous situation?</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>नो चेद्धि वयमप्येनं महीमनु शयीमहि। बीभत्सोः कोपदीप्तस्य दग्धाः कृपणचक्षुषा॥<br />Alas, after him, today we also shall lay ourselves down on the field of battle, being consumed by the glances of grief cast by Vibhatsu inflamed with rage.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>अलुब्धो मतिमान् ह्रीमान् क्षमावान् रूपवान् बली। वपुष्मान् मानकृद् वीरः प्रियः सत्यपराक्रमः॥ यस्य श्लाघन्ति विबुधाः कर्माण्यूर्जितकर्मणः। निवातकवचाञ्जने कालकेयांश्च वीर्यवान्॥ महेन्द्रशत्रवो येन हिरण्यपुरवासिनः। अक्ष्णोनिमेषमात्रेण पौलोमाः सगणा हताः॥ परेभ्योऽप्यभयार्थिभ्यो यो ददात्यभयं विभुः। तस्यास्माभिर्न शकितस्त्रातुमप्यात्मजो बली॥<br />Arjuna is free from covetousness, intelligent, bashful, forbearing, handsome, powerful, endowed with well-developed limbs, respectful to the elders, heroic, amiable and devoted to truth; the feats of that one of fierce deeds even the gods applaud; that one of puissant energy slew Nivatakavachas and also the Kalakeyas; by him were the opponents of the great Indra, the dwellers of the golden cities, viz., the Paulamas slain with their followers, within the twinkling of any eye; that lord gives assurance of safety to those who seek to be protected from their enemies. Alas, today, we have not been competent through fear, to save the son even of that one!</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>तु सुमहत् प्राप्तं धार्तराष्ट्रान् महाबलान्। पार्थः पुत्रवधात् क्रुद्धः कौरवाशोषयिष्यति॥<br />Surely a great fear has overtaken the mighty host of the son of Dhritarashtra. Filled with rage at the slaughter of his son the son of Pritha (Arjuna) without doubt extirpate the Kauravas.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>क्षुद्रः क्षुद्रसहायश्च स्वपक्षक्षयमातुरः। व्यक्तं दुर्योधनो दृष्ट्वाशोचन् हास्यति जीवितम्॥<br />It is also evident that the mean-minded Duryodhana, having mean counselors, that destroyer of his own partisans, seeing the destruction of the troops and overtaken by grief, shall give up his life.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>न मे जयः प्रीतिकरो न राज्यं न चामरत्वं न सुरैः सलोकता। इमं समीक्ष्याप्रतिवीर्यपौरुषं निपातितं देववरात्मजात्मजम्॥<br />Beholding this son of Indra's son endowed with unequalled energy and prowess fallen on the field of battle, neither victory, nor kingdom, nor immortality, nor equality of rank with the celestials, does afford me the least joy.</p>
