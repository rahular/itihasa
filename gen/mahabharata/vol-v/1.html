<p id='2'>तमप्रतिमसत्त्वौजोबलवीर्यसमन्वितम्। हतं देवव्रतं श्रुत्वा पाञ्चाल्येन शिखण्डिना॥ धृतराष्ट्रस्ततो राजा शोकव्याकुललोचनः। किमचेष्टत विप्रर्षे हते पितरि वीर्यवान्॥<br />Janamejaya said Hearing that his sire Devavrata of unequaled might, energy, sturdiness, prowess and vigour, had been slain by Sikhandin the son of Panchala. O Brahmanical sage, what did the very powerful monarch Dhritarashtra with eyes blinded with fast-falling tears, do?</p>
<p id='3'>तस्य पुत्रो हि भगवन् भीष्मद्रोणमुखै रथैः। पराजित्य महेष्वासान् पाण्डवान् राज्यमिच्छति॥<br />His son, O worshipful one, desired to obtain monarchy after having defeated the mighty warriors, the sons of Pandu, through the assistance of Bhima, Drona and other such heroes.</p>

<p id='6'>तस्य चिन्तयतो दुःखमनिशं पार्थिवस्य तत्। आजगाम विशुद्धात्मा पुनर्गावल्गणिस्तदा॥<br />When that foremost of the Kurus had been thus brooding over his grief, there came again to him the pure-souled son of Gavalgani.</p>
<p id='7'>शिबिरात् संजयं प्राप्तं निशि नागाह्वयं पुरम्। आम्बिकेयो महाराज धृतराष्ट्रोऽन्वपृच्छत॥<br />O great king, Dhritarashtra, the son of Ambika, then thus questioned Sanjaya who had that night returned from the camp of the city named after the elephant.</p>
<p id='8'>श्रुत्वा भीष्मस्य निधनमप्रहृष्टमना भृशम्। पुत्राणां जयमाकाङ्क्षन् विललापातुरो यथा॥<br />Hearing of the death of Bhishma, he became exceedingly cheerless and longing for the victory of his sons, he broke out into lamentations like one sorely distressed.</p>
<p id='9'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच संशोच्य तु महात्मानं भीष्मं भीमपराक्रमम्। किमकार्षुः परं तात कुरुः कालचोदिताः॥<br />Dhritarashtra said O son, having bewailed the high-souled Bhima of terrific might, what did the Kurus, goaded by Destiny, do?</p>

<p id='11'>तदुदीर्णं महत् सैन्यं त्रैलोक्यस्यापि संजय। भयमुत्पादयेत् तीव्र पाण्डवानां महात्मनाम्॥ को हि दौर्योधने सैन्ये पुमानासीन्महारथः। यं प्राप्य समरे वीरा न त्रस्यन्ति महाभये॥<br />Verily, O Sanjaya, the innumerable and excellent army of the high-souled sons of Pandu, can strike the worlds with keenest apprehension. In this terrific battle, was any great car-warrior in the troop of Duryodhana who was fearless?</p>
<p id='12'>संजय उवाच देवव्रते तु निहते कुरूणामृषभे तदा। किमकार्ष पतयस्तन्ममाचक्ष्व संजय॥<br />Sanjaya said Therefore, O Sanjaya, recount to me what the kings did, when Devarata, the foremost of the Kurus, had been slain.</p>
<p id='13'>शृणु राजन्नेकमना वचनं ब्रुवतो मम। यत् ते पुत्रास्तदाऽकार्युर्हते देवव्रते मृधे॥<br />Hear, O monarch, with singleness of mind, the words, falling from my lips, regarding what your sons did when Devavrata had fallen.</p>
<p id='14'>निहते तु तदा भीष्मे राजन् सत्यपराक्रमे। तावकाः पाण्डवेयाश्च प्राध्यायन्त पृथक् पृथक्॥<br />0 monarch, when Bhishma of invincible prowess had been slain, your own warriors and also those of the Pandava host, began to think of the duties of the Kshatriya sect; and,</p>
<p id='15'>विस्मिताश्च प्रहृष्टाश्च क्षत्रधर्मं निशम्य ते। स्वधर्म निन्दमानास्ते प्रणिपत्य महात्मने॥ शयनं कल्पयामासुर्भीष्मायामितकर्मणे। सोपधानं नरव्याघ्र शरैः संनतपर्वभिः॥<br />o lord of men, at the thought, they wondered and were delighted; and in obedience to their sectarian duties, they bowed down to the illustrious Bhishma. Then those foremost of men prepared for Bhishma of infinite energy a bed furnished with a pillow, made of close-knotted arrows.</p>
<p id='16'>विधाय रक्षां भीष्माय समाभाष्य परस्परम्। अनुमान्य च गाङ्गेयं कृत्वा चापि प्रदक्षिणम्॥ क्रोधसंरक्तनयनाः समवेत्य परस्परम्। पुनर्युद्धाय निर्जग्मुः क्षत्रियाः कालचोदिताः॥<br />Having arranged for Bhishma's safety and having greeted one another, and with the permission of the son of Ganga and having circumambulated him and looking at each other with eyes coppery with anger, those Kshatriyas, goaded by Destiny, again issued forth for fighting with one another.</p>
<p id='17'>ततस्तूर्यनिनादैश्च भेरीणां निनदेन च। तावकानामनीकानि परेषां च विनिर्ययुः॥<br />Then to the voice of the trumpets and to the roar of the drums, the army of your sons and that of their adversaries, formed in battle-array.</p>
<p id='18'>व्यावृत्तेऽर्यम्णि राजेन्द्र पतिते जाह्नवीसुते। अमर्षवशमापन्नाः कालोपहतचेतसः॥ अनादृत्य वचः पथ्यं गाङ्गेयस्य महात्मनः। निर्ययुर्भरतश्रेष्ठाः शस्त्राण्यादाय सत्वराः॥<br />When, O greatest of kings, the son of Janhavi (Bhishma) had fallen and when the greater part of the day had worn out, these foremost of the Bharata race, overpowered by the influence of their wrath, and having their reasons bewildered through fate and neglecting the salutary counsel of the illustrious son of Ganga, came out in haste grasping their weapons.</p>
<p id='19'>मोहात् तव सपुत्रस्य वधाच्छान्तनवस्य च। कौरव्या मृत्युसाद्भूताः सहिताः सर्वराजभिः॥<br />Owing to your own foolishness and that of your sons and owing to the death of the son of Shantanu, the descendants of the Kuru race together with all the (assembled) kings, appeared to be summoned by the God of death.</p>
<p id='20'>अजावय इवागोपा वने श्वापदसंकुले। भृशमुद्विग्नमनसो हीना देवव्रतेन ते॥<br />Like a herd of goats without a herdsman in wood infested with beasts of prey, they were exceedingly oppressed with fear, being deprived of Devavrata.</p>
<p id='21'>पतिते भरतश्रेष्ठे बभूव कुरुवाहिनी। द्यौरिवापेतनक्षत्रा हीनं खमिव वायुना॥ विपन्नसस्येव मही वाक् चैवासंस्कृता तथा। आसुरीव यथा सेना निगृहीते नृपे बलौ॥<br />On the fall of that foremost of the Bharata race, the army of the Kurus resembled the heavenly dome stripped of the stars or the sky deprived of the atmosphere; or the earth with her crops blighted; or a discourse teeming with unrefined expressions; or the army of the Asuras when in the days of yore, Bali had been (thoroughly) humiliated.</p>
<p id='22'>विधवेव वरारोहा शुष्कतोयेव निम्नगा। वृकैरिव वने रुद्धा पृषती हतयूथपा॥ शरभाहतसिंहेव महती गिरिकन्दरा। भारती भरतश्रेष्ठे पतिते जाह्नवीसुते॥<br />Or a charming lady deprived of her lord; a stream the waters of which had been dried up; or a doe deprived of her mate, surrounded by wolves in the forest or the wide, extended, mountain-cave having its lion slain by the fabulous Sarabha. Or the slaughter of Janhavi's son, O foremost of the Bharata race, the army of the Bharatas.</p>
<p id='23'>विश्वग्वाताहता रुग्णा नौरिवासीन्महार्णवे। बलिभिः पाण्डवैरीरैर्लब्धलक्ष शार्दिता॥<br />Resembled a tiny bark thrown up and down on the bosom of the mighty main, driven by the gale rushing from all sides. It was then greatly harassed by the powerful Pandavas heroes of infallible aims.</p>
<p id='24'>सा तदाऽऽसीद् भृशं सेना व्याकुलाश्वरथद्विपा। विपन्नभूयिष्ठनरा कृपणा ध्वस्तमानसा॥<br />Then that host, with its elephants, horses and car-warriors, was much distressed and exceedingly jeopardised and rendered helpless and terror-stricken.</p>
<p id='25'>तस्यां त्रस्ता नृपतयः सैनिकाश्च पृथग्विधाः। पाताल इव मज्जन्तो हीना देवव्रतेन ते॥<br />Then, in that army, bereft of Devavrata, the kings and the (common) soldiers, individually struck with panic, seemed to be sinking into the nethermost regions.</p>
<p id='26'>कर्णे हि कुरवोऽस्मार्षुः स हि देवव्रतोपमः। सर्वशस्त्रभृतां श्रेष्ठं रोचमानमिवातिथिम्॥ बन्धुमापद्गतस्येव तमेवोपागमन्मनः। चक्रुशुः कर्ण कर्णेति तत्र भारत पार्थिवाः॥<br />Thereafter the Kauravas remembered Karna, who was equal to Devavrata himself and who was the foremost of all wielders of weapons and resplendent like a guest. Then like the heart of a distressed person looking for a friend, their hearts turned towards him (Karna); and, O Bharata, the kings then broke out into exclamations saying, "O Karna, O Karna."</p>
<p id='27'>राधेयं हितमस्माकं सूतपुत्रं तनुत्यजम्। स हि नायुध्यत तदा दशाहानि महायशाः॥ सामात्यबन्धुः कर्णो वै तमानयत मा चिरम्। भीष्मेण हि महाबाहुः सर्वक्षत्रस्य पश्यतः॥ रथेषु गण्यमानेषु बलविक्रमशालिषु। संख्यातोऽर्धरथः कर्णोद्विगुणः सन्नरर्षभः॥<br />That son of Radha, that benefactor of ours, that progeny of Suta, he that will sacrifice his life in battle, that one of illustrious renown with his followers and friends, has refrained from fighting these ten days; summon him without delay. That foremost of men, that hero of mighty arms, Karna, had been reckoned by Bhishma as only an Ardharatha, in the presence of all the Kshatriyas, during the tale of car-warriors of valour and prowess, in spite of his being equal to two Maharathas.</p>
<p id='28'>स्थातिरथसंख्यायां योऽग्रणीः शूरसम्मतः। सासुरानपि देवेशान् रणे यो योद्धमुत्सहेत्॥<br />Indeed in that enumeration of Rathas and Atirathas, Karna was thus reckoned-Karna who is the foremost (of all fighters), who is held in high respect by the heroes and who would dare give battle even to Yama, Kubera, Varuna and Indra.</p>
<p id='29'>स तु तेनैव कोपेन राजन् गाङ्गेयमुक्तवान्। त्वयि जीवति कौरव्य नाहं योत्स्ये कदाचन॥ त्वया तु पाण्डवेयेषु निहतेषु महामृधे। दुर्योधनमनुज्ञाप्य वनं यास्यामि कौरव॥<br />Out of wrath (excited by this classification of himself, he had thus addressed, O king, the son of Ganga-'O Kaurava, I will not fight so long as you live; if you shall slay in battle the Sons of Pandu, O you of Kuru'a race, I will retire into the woods with the permission of Duryodhana.</p>
<p id='30'>पाण्डवैर्वा हते भीष्मे त्वयि स्वर्गमुपेयुषि। हन्तास्येकरथेनैव कृत्स्नान् यान् मन्यसे रथान्॥<br />If, O Bhisma, on the contrary, you, being slain by the Pandavas, are transported to heaven, then will I, riding on a single car, slay those whom you consider to be the mightiest of all car-warriors.</p>
<p id='31'>एवमुक्त्वा महाबाहुर्दशाहानि महायशाः। नायुध्यत ततः कर्णः पुत्रस्य तव सम्मते॥<br />Having thus spoken, the mighty-armed Karna of illustrious renown, refrained, with the perinission of your son, from taking part in the battle for these ten days.</p>
<p id='32'>भीष्मः समरविक्रान्तः पाण्डवेयस्य भारत। जघान समरे योधानसंख्येयपराक्रमः॥<br />0 Bharata, Bhishma of immeasurable prowess, displaying his might in battle, slew a large number of warriors of the Pandava host in that (sanguinary) engagement.</p>
<p id='33'>तस्मिंस्तु निहते शूरे सत्यसंधे महौजसि। त्वत्सुता: कर्णमस्मार्पुस्ततुकामा इव प्लवम्॥<br />On the fall of that most powerful hero of linerring aim, your sons remembered Karna, like persons desirous of crossing the ocean) remembering a raft.</p>
<p id='34'>तावकास्तव पुत्राश्च सहिताः सर्वराजभिः। हा कालोऽयमिति चाब्रुवन्॥<br />Your sons and the warriors of your party, together with the (assembled) monarchs then, began to bewail saying 'Karna' they also said 'It is time for you to come.'</p>
<p id='35'>एवं ते स्म हि राधेयं सूतपुत्रं तनुत्यजम्। चुक्रुशुः सहिता योधास्तत्र तत्र महाबलाः॥.<br />Thus all the warriors endued with great prowess, bewailed on the dead body of Karna, the son of Suta and Radha.</p>
<p id='36'>जामदग्न्याभ्यनुज्ञातमस्त्रे दुर्वारपौरुषम्। आगमन्नो मनः कर्णे बन्धुमात्यमिकेष्विव॥ कर्ण इति चाक्रन्दन्<br />As during emergencies the heart flies to a friend, so our hearts then flew to Karna of irrepressible manhood who had acquired his knowledge of weapons from the son of Jamadagni.</p>
<p id='37'>स हि शक्तो रणे राजंस्त्रातुमस्मान् महाभयात्। त्रिदशानिव गोविन्दः सततं सुमहाभयात्॥<br />O monarch, he only was capable of saving us from the great dangers of battle, iike Govinda protecting the celestials from all calamities.</p>
<p id='38'>वैशम्पायन उवाच तथा तु संजयं कर्णे कीर्तयन्तं पुनः पुनः। आशीविषवदुच्छ्वस्य धृतराष्ट्रोऽब्रवीदिदम्॥<br />Vaishampayana said Thereupon breathing (heavily) out like a snake, Dhritarashtra spoke these words to Sanjaya who had been thus repeatedly extolling Karna.</p>
<p id='39'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच यत् तद्वैकर्तनं कर्णमगमद् वो मनस्तदा। अप्यपश्यत राधेयं सूतपूत्रं तनुत्धजम्॥<br />Dhritarashtra said As your heart then were drawn to wards Karna, the son of Vikartana, you surely saw that son of Radha, that descendant of Suta, who was ever-ready to lay down his life for you.</p>
<p id='40'>अपि तन्न मृषाकार्षीत् कच्चित् सत्यपराक्रमः। सम्भ्रान्तानां तदार्तानां त्रस्तानां त्राणमिच्छताम्॥<br />Did that Karna, of infallible prowess in battle, disappoint Duryodhana and his brothers, who had been all exceedingly distressed, panicstruck and anxious for being extricated from their difficulties?</p>
<p id='41'>अपि तत् पूरयांचक्रे धनुर्धरवरो युधि। यत्तद् विनिहते भीष्मे कौरवाणामपाकृतम्॥<br />Was that foremost of bowmen in battle capable of filling up the void created by the fall of Bhishma, the shelter of the Kurus?</p>
<p id='42'>तत् खण्डं पूरयन् कर्णः परेषामादधद् भयम्। स हि वै पुरुषव्याघ्रो लोके संजय कथ्यते॥<br />Supplying the gap, was Karna successful in striking terror into the hearts of the enemy? Therefore, it is said, O Sanjaya! he is the lion among the men.</p>
<p id='43'>आर्तानां बान्धवानां च क्रन्दतां च विशेषतः। परित्यज्य रणे प्राणांस्तत्त्राणार्थं च शर्म च। कृतवान् मम पुत्राणां जयाशां सफलामपि॥<br />Renouncing his breaths in battle field, for protecting the helpless, distressed and roaring our relatives, did he also succeed in fructifying the hopes of victory cherished by my sons?
