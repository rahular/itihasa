<h3>None: Chapter 140</h3><h4>Continuous The slaughter of Alambusha</h4><p id='1'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच अहन्यहनि मे दीप्तं यशः पतति संजय। हता मे बहवो योधा मन्ये कालस्य पर्ययम्॥<br />Dhritarashtra said Day by day, O Sanjaya, by blazing fame is dwindling away. Numerous warriors of my side are being slain. I consider all this to be due to the adverse influence of Fate.</p>
<p id='2'>धनंजयः सुसंकुद्धः प्रविष्टो मामकं बलम्। रक्षितं द्रौणिकर्णाभ्यामप्रवेश्यं सुरैरपि॥<br />Inflamed with wrath, Dhananjaya has entered into my host which is protected by Drona's son and Karna and which is therefore incapable of being penetrated into by the very celestials.</p>
<p id='3'>ताभ्यामूर्जितवीर्याभ्यामाप्यायितपराक्रमः। सहितः कृष्णभीमाभ्यां शिनीनामृषभेण च॥<br />Dhananjaya's prowess has increased in consequence of his being united with that foremost of the Sinis and those two of burning energy, namely Krishna and Bhima.</p>
<p id='4'>तदाप्रभृति मां शोको दहत्यग्निरिवाशयम्। ग्रस्तानिव प्रपश्यामि भूमिपालान् ससैन्धवान्।॥<br />Like fire burning down a heap of dry grass, grief is corroding my heart since I have heard of Dhananjaya's entrance into my army. I see that all the king's of the earth with the ruler of the Sindhus amongst them, are under the influence of adverse Fate.</p>
<p id='5'>अप्रियं सुमहत् कृत्वा सिन्धुराजः किरीटिनः। चक्षुर्विषयमा यमापन्नः कथं जीवितमाप्नुयात्॥<br />Having inflicted a terrible injury to the diadem-checked Arjuna, how could the ruler of the Sindhu's escape with his life, when he would become the object of Arjuna's sight?</p>
<p id='6'>अनुमानाच पश्यामि नास्ति संजय सैन्धवः। युद्धं तु तद् यथावृत्तं तन्ममाचक्ष्व तत्त्वतः॥<br />O Sanjaya, I can imagine even now that the king of the Sindhus no longer lives. Therefore, tell me how in reality did that battle rage then.</p>
<p id='7'>यश्च विक्षोभ्य महतीं सेनामालोड्य चासकृत्। एकः प्रविष्टः संक्रुद्धो नलिनीमिव कुञ्जरः॥<br />He that had single-handed and unsupported entered into and agitated my army, even as an infuriate elephant enters and crushes a group of lotuses.</p>
<p id='8'>तस्य मे वृष्णिवीरस्य ब्रूहि युद्धं यथातथम्। धनंजयार्थे यत्तस्य कुशलो ह्यसि संजय॥<br />Tell me of the feats of that Vrishnipero, as he achieved them, struggling to help Dhananjaya in battle. O Sanjaya, you are an expert in narration.</p>

<p id='10'>नदन् यथा वज्रधरस्तपान्ते ज्वलन् यथा जलदान्ते च सूर्येः। निघ्नन्नमित्रान् धनुषा दृढेन स कम्पयंस्तव पुत्रस्य सेनाम्॥<br />Uttering thundering roars like the clouds at the expiration of the summer season or burning like the sun at the end of the rainy season, he began to slaughter his foes by means of his tough bow and caused the troops of your son repeatedly to tremble.</p>
<p id='11'>तं यान्तमश्वै रजतप्रकाशैरायोधने वीरवरं नदन्तम्। नाशक्नुवन् वारयितुं त्वदीयाः सर्वे तथा भारत माधवाग्रयम्॥<br />When that foremost of Madhu's race careered on the field on his chariot drawn by horses of argentine hue and roared fiercely, O Bharata, there was none amongst your troops who could then check him.</p>
<p id='12'>अमर्षपूर्णस्त्वनिवृत्तयोधी शरासनी काञ्चनवर्मधारी। अलम्बुषः मवारयद् राजवरोऽभिपत्य॥<br />Then that foremost of kings namely Alambusha excited with wrath, untreatreating in battle, armed with a bow and covered in a golden coat of mail, advancing against Satyaki checked his carreer in battle.</p>
