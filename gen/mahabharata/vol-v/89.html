<p id='29'>प्रतोदैश्चापकोटीभिर्हङ्कारैः साधुवाहितैः। कशापाय॑भिघातैश्च वाग्भिरुग्राभिरेव च॥ चोदयन्तो हयांस्तूर्णे पलायन्ते स्म तावकाः। सादिनो रथिनश्चैव पत्तयश्चार्जुनार्दिताः॥<br />Afflicted by Arjuna, you troops viz., the cavalry, the infantry and the car-warriors, fled in all haste from the field of battle, urging their horses to the top of their speed by goadstrokes, by stroke of the horns of their bows, by growls, by encouraging commands, by who's by (dagger) cuts on their flanks and also by threatening speeches.</p>
<p id='30'>पाष्णर्यंङ्गुष्टाङ्कुशे गं चादयन्तस्तथा परे। शरैः सम्मोहिताश्चान्ये तमेवाभिमुखा ययुः। तव योधा हतोत्साहा विभ्रान्तमनसस्तदा।॥<br />Others (riding on elephants) fled urging their huge by pressing their sides with toes or with the stroke of the hooks; others again confounded by Parthas arrows, even fled to the direction of Partha himself.
