<h3>None: Chapter 41</h3><h4>The display of Abhimanyu's prowess</h4><p id='1'>संजय उवाच सोऽतिगर्जन् धनुष्पाणियाविकर्षन् पुनः पुनः। तयोर्महात्मनोस्तूर्णं स्थान्तरमवापतत्॥<br />Sanjaya said Then that brother of Karna armed with a bow and stretching its string repeatedly, soon placed himself between those two high-souled car-warriors.</p>
<p id='2'>सोऽविध्यद् दशभिर्बाणैरभिमन्यु दुरासदम्। सच्छत्रध्वजयन्तारं साश्वमाशु स्मयन्निव॥<br />Then as if smiling he pierced the invincible Abhimanyu together with his umbrella, standard, charioteer and steeds with ten sharp arrows.</p>
<p id='3'>पितृपैतामहं कर्म कुर्वाणमतिमानुषम्। दृष्टवादितं शरैः काणिं त्वदीया हृषिताऽभवन्॥<br />Then beholding Abhimanyu, who had been achieving superhuman feats after the manner of his father and grandfather, afflicted with those shafts, your warriors became enraptured.</p>
<p id='4'>तस्याभिमन्युरुयम्य स्मयन्नेकेन पत्रिणा। शिरः प्रच्यावयामास तद्रथात् प्रापतद् भुवि॥<br />Thereupon Abhimanyu smiled and bending his bow shot a winged shaft that lopped off his antagonist's head and then the latter fell down from his chariot.</p>
<p id='5'>कर्णिकारमिवाधूतं वातेनापतितं नगात्। भ्रातरं निहतं दृष्ट्वा राजन् कर्णो व्यथां ययौ।।५।<br />The, O monarch, Karna was extremely pained on seeing his brother slain and overthrown like a blossoming Karnikara tree thrown drown by the wind from the mountain top.</p>
<p id='6'>विमुखीकृत्य कर्णे तु सौभद्रः कङ्कपत्रिभिः। अन्यानपि महेष्वासांस्तूर्णमेवाभिदुद्ववे॥<br />Thereafter having compelled Karna 10 tumn back from the field with arrows furnished with Kanka feathers, Subhadra's son quickly assailed other mighty bowmen.</p>
<p id='7'>ततस्तद् विततं सैन्यं हस्त्यश्वरथपत्तिमत्। क्रूद्धोऽभिमन्युरभिनत् तिग्मतेजा महारथः॥<br />Then Abhimanyu possessed of fierce energy and great renown, wrought up with rage, began to break through the various division of cars, elephants, steeds and infantry.</p>
<p id='8'>कर्णस्तु बहुभिर्बाणैरर्धमानोऽभिमन्युना। अपायाज्जवनैरश्वैस्ततोऽनीकमभज्यत॥<br />Meanwhile Karna who had been afflicted by Abhimanyu with his myriads of shafts, fled away from the field of battle, being borne by fleet steeds. Your army then began to give way.</p>
<p id='9'>शलभैरिव चाकाशे धाराभिरिव चावृते। अभिमन्योः शरै राजन् न प्राज्ञायत किंचन॥<br />Then when the sky was covered with the arrows of Abhimanyu, like the flights of locusts or thick showers of rain, o king, nothing could be distinguished.</p>
<p id='10'>तावकानां तु योधानां वध्यतां निशितैः शरैः। अन्यत्र सैन्धवाद् राजन् न स्म कश्चिदतिष्ठत॥<br />Amongst all your warriors then thus slaughtered by Abhimanyu with his sharp shafts, none stayed on the field, except the ruler of the Sindhus.</p>
<p id='11'>सौभद्रस्तु ततः शङ्ख प्रध्माष्य पुरुषर्षभः। शीघ्रमभ्यपतत् सेनां भारती भरतर्षभ॥<br />Thereupon, that foremost of princes viz., Subhadra's son, blowing his conch fell. O foremost of the Bharatas, upon the army of Bharatas.</p>
<p id='12'>स कक्षेऽग्निरिवोत्सृष्टो निर्दहंस्तरसा रिपून्। मध्ये भारतसैन्यानामा निः पर्यवर्तत॥<br />Then like fire set to work on a heap of dried grass, consuming the hostile ranks, Arjuna's son moved in circles amidst the Kaurava hou.</p>
<p id='13'>रथनागाश्वमनुजानर्दयन् निशितैः शरैः। सम्प्रविश्याकरोद् भूमि कबन्धगणसंकुलाम्॥<br />Breaking through the hostije array, he began to afflict car-warriors, elephant-riders, horse-men and infantry with his great arrows; and thus made the earth impassable with headless trunks.</p>
<p id='14'>सौभद्रचापप्रभवैर्निकृत्ताः परमेषुभिः। स्वानेवाभिमुखान् जन्तः प्राद्रवन् जीवितार्थिनः॥<br />Mangled with the shafts of excellent make, shot from the bow of Subhadra's son, the Kauravas fled in fear of their lives, slaying, as they ran, their own partisans that happened to meet them.</p>
<p id='15'>ते घोरा रौद्रकर्माणो विपाठा बहवः शिताः। निघ्नतो रथनागाश्वाञ्जग्मुराशु वसुंधराम्॥<br />Those dreadful shafts of terrible effects and touch, penetrating penetrating through car-warriors, elephants and horses, struck on the earth's surface.</p>
<p id='16'>सायुधाः साङ्गुलित्राणाः सगदाः साङ्गदा रणे। दृश्यन्ते बाहवश्छिन्ना हेमाभरणभूषिताः॥<br />With weapons in grasp, with fingerpreservers, with maces in clutch and with Angadas and decked with golden ornaments, arms were seen to be strewn on the ground.</p>
<p id='17'>शराश्चापानि खङ्गाश्च शरीराणि शिरांसि च। सकुण्डलानि स्रग्वीणि भूमावासन् सहस्रशः॥<br />Arrows and bows and swords and corpses and heads with ear-rings and garlands were seen on the ground by hundreds.</p>
<p id='18'>सोपस्करैरधिष्ठानैरीषादण्डैश्च बन्धुरैः। अक्षैविमथितैश्चनर्बहुधा पतितैर्युगः॥ शक्तिचापासिभिश्चैव पतितैश्च महाध्वजैः। चर्मचापशरैश्चैव व्यवकीर्णैः समन्ततः॥ निहतैः क्षत्रियैरश्वैर्वारणैश्च विशाम्पते। अगम्यरूपा पृथिवी क्षणेनासीत् सुदारुणा॥<br />Strewn over with Upashkaras, Adishthanas, long poles and with shattered Akshasas and broken wheels and yokes, thousands in number, with arrows, bows, swords, fallen standards; with backless bows and shafts scattered about, with the bodies of slain Kshatriyas, horses and elephants, the field of battle looking fierce soon became impassable.</p>
<p id='19'>वध्यतां राजपुत्राणां क्रन्दतामितरेतरम्। प्रादुरासीन्महाशब्दो भीरूणां भयवर्धनः॥<br />Then as the princes were being slaughtered by Abhimanyu, they created a loud noise enhancing the apprehension of the cowards by calling one another by their names.</p>
<p id='20'>स शब्दो भरतश्रेष्ठ दिशः सर्वा व्यनादयत्। सौभद्रश्चाद्रवत् सेनां जन् वराश्वरथद्विपान्॥<br />That din, O foremost of the Bharatas, filled all the points of the compass with its echo; the son of Subhadra then assailed the Kauravas host killing excellent car-warriors, steeds and elephants.</p>
<p id='21'>कक्षमग्निरिवोत्सृष्टो निर्दहंस्तरसा रिपून्। मध्ये भारतसैन्यानामा निः प्रत्यदृश्यत॥<br />Then like fire set to a heap of straw, Arjuna's son began to consume his foes; and he was then seen to stand in the very centre of the Bharata troops.</p>
<p id='22'>विचरन्तं दिशः सर्वा प्रदिशश्चापि भारत। तं तदा नानुपश्यामः सैन्ये च रजसाऽऽवृते॥<br />Then surrounded as he was by our troops and covered with dust, we could not obtain sight of him, when he, O Bharata, careered through the cardinal and subsidiary directions.</p>
<p id='23'>आददानं गजाश्वानां नृणां चायूंषि भारता क्षणेन भूयः पश्यामः सूर्ये मध्यंदिने यथा।॥<br />The next moment, O Bharata, we beheld him shining like the mid-day sun and wrenching the lives out of elephants, steeds and men.</p>
<p id='24'>अभिमन्यु महाराज प्रतपन्तं द्विषद्गणान्। स वासवसमः संख्ये वासवस्यात्मजात्मजः। अभिमन्युर्महाराज सैन्यमध्ये व्यरोचत॥<br />We then beheld, O mighty monarch, Abhimanyu afflict his foes. In that battle that grandson of Vasava viz., Abhimanyu equal to Vasava himself in prowess, shone, O mighty monarch, in the very centre of your troops.</p>
