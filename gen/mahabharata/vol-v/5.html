<p id='2'>सनाथमिव मन्येऽहं भवता पालितं बलम्। अत्र किं नु समर्थे यद्धितं तत् सम्प्रधार्यताम्॥<br />I consider this army, protected by you, to have found a suitable commander in you. Do you now decide that which will be beneficial (to this army) and which is practicable.</p>
<p id='3'>कर्ण उवाच ब्रूहि नः पुरुषव्याघ्र त्वं हि प्राज्ञतमो नृप। यथा चार्थपतिः कृत्यं पश्यते न तथेतरः॥<br />Karna said O foremost of men, yourself speak to us, since you are the wisest of kings. A third person cannot so well descry as to what should be done, as he who is interested in any affair.</p>
<p id='4'>ते स्म सर्वे तव वचः श्रोतुकामा नरेश्वर। नान्याय्यं हि भवान् वाक्यं ब्रूयादिति मतिर्मम॥<br />All these rulers of men are desirous of hcaring your words; and I am sure you will never speak unjust words.</p>
<p id='5'>दुर्योधन उवाच भीष्मः सेनाप्रणेताऽऽसीद् वयसा विक्रमेण च। श्रुतेन चोपसम्पन्नः सर्वैर्योधगणैस्तथा॥ तेनातियशसा कर्ण जता शत्रुगणान् मम। सुयुद्धेन दशाहानि पालिताः स्मो महात्मना॥<br />Duryodhana said Owing to his prowess, seniority, knowledge of the Srutis and the support he obtained from all the warriors, he (Bhishma) was the leader of our host. In the fair battle of these ten days that highly glorious one of generous soul, O Karna, slew a large number of my foes and protected my own army.</p>
<p id='6'>तस्मिन्नसुकरं कर्म कृतवत्यास्थिते दिवम्। कंन सेनाप्रणेतारं मन्यसे तदनन्तरम्॥<br />When that onc, who accomplished many difficult acts, is gone to heaven, ( Karna, whom do you consider capable of leading this host into battle)?</p>
<p id='7'>न बिना नायकं सेना मुहूर्तमपि तिष्ठति। आहवेष्वाहवश्रेष्ठ नेतृहीनेव नौ ले॥<br />Like an unmanned boat in waters, the army cannot stand in battle even for a short while without a leader, O Karna, O you who are foremost in battle.</p>
<p id='8'>यथा ह्यकर्णधारा नौ रथश्चासारथिर्यथा। द्रवेद् यथेष्टं तद्वत् स्याहते सेनापति बलम्॥<br />An army without a commander is like a boat with none to steer her through or like a chariot without a driver, going any where.</p>
<p id='9'>अदेशिको यथा सार्थः सर्वः कृच्छ्रे समृच्छति। अनायका तथा सेना सर्वान् दोषान् समर्छति॥<br />Just as a foreign trader in an unknown country reaps all distress, so an army without a commander is exposed to all dangers.</p>
<p id='10'>स भवान् वीक्ष्य सर्वेषु मामकेषु महात्मसु। पश्य सेनापतिं युक्तमनु शान्तनवादिह॥<br />Therefore do you look among all these high-souled warriors of ours and find out a proper person who may, as a commander, fill the place of Shantanu's son.</p>
<p id='11'>यं हि सेनाप्रणेतारं भवान् वक्ष्यति संयुगे। तं वयं सहिताः सर्वे करिष्यामो न संशयः॥<br />The person, who you will consider to be fit to lead our army, in battle, will undoubtedly be chosen to be so unanimously.</p>

<p id='13'>कुलसंहननज्ञानैर्बलविक्रमबुद्धिभिः। युक्ताः श्रुतज्ञा धीमन्त आहवेष्वनिवर्तिनः॥<br />All of them are perfectly acquainted with the genelogies (of princes) and with the vital parts of the body; they are possessed of prowess, might and intelligence; they are grateful, highly intelligent and unretreating from battle.</p>
<p id='14'>युगपन्न तु ते शक्याः कर्तुं सर्वे पुरःसराः। एक एव तु कर्तव्यो यस्मिन् वैशेषिका गुणाः॥<br />But all of them cannot at the same time assume the leadership; therefore only one among them is to be chosen, in whom there reside superior qualities.</p>
<p id='15'>अन्योन्यस्पर्धिनां होषां यद्येकं यं करिष्यसि। शेषा विमनसो व्यक्तं न योत्स्यन्ति हितास्तव॥<br />If you promote among several contending rivals, the rest, it is clear, being depressed, will not fight with a desire for doing your good.</p>
<p id='16'>अयं च सर्वयोधानामाचार्यः स्थविरो गुरुः। यक्तः सेनापतिः कर्तुं द्रोणः शस्त्रभृतां वरः॥<br />But this foremost of all the wielders of weapons, this preceptor and teacher, of all the warriors, this Drona who is venerable in years, is worthy of being elected generalissimo.</p>
<p id='17'>को हि तिष्ठति दुर्धर्षे द्रोणे शस्त्रभृतां वरे। सेनापतिः स्यादन्योऽस्माच्छुकाङ्गिरसदर्शनात्॥<br />When the indomitable Drona, who is foremost among those conversant with Brahma and is equal to Shuka and Angirasa in learning, is here, who else is worthy of being selected as a leader?</p>
<p id='18'>न च सोऽप्यस्ति ते योधः सर्वराजसु भारत। द्रोणं यः समरे यान्तं नानुयास्यति संयुगे॥<br />O Bharata, there is not even a single warrior among this mighty host of kings, who will not follow Drona when he goes to fight.</p>
<p id='19'>एष सेनाप्रणेतृणामेष शस्त्रभृतामपि। एष बुद्धिमतां चैव श्रेष्ठो राजन् गुरुस्तव॥<br />O monarch, this one is the foremost of all leaders of warriors; he is the foremost of all wielders of arms, as also of all intelligent persons and he is also your preceptor (in arms).</p>
<p id='20'>एवं दुर्योधनाचार्यमाशु सेनापतिं कुरु। जिगीषन्तोऽसुरान् संख्ये कार्तिकेयमिवामराः॥<br />As the immortals desirous of defeating the Asuras in battle made Kartikeya their leader, so, do you, O Duryodhana, soon elect this one (Drona) as the leader of your army.</p>
