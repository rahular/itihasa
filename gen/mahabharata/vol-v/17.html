<h3>SAMSHAPTAKA-VADHA PARVA: Chapter 17</h3><h4>The departure of Dhananjaya</h4><p id='1'>संजय उवाच ते सेने शिबिरं गत्वा न्यविशेतां विशाम्पते। यथाभागं यथान्यायं यथागुल्मं च सर्वशः॥<br />Sanjaya said O lord of men, the troops having retired to their camps, duly took up their quarters, according to the divisions and ranks to which they belonged.</p>
<p id='2'>कृत्वावहारं सैन्यानां द्रोणः परमदुर्मनाः। दुर्योधनमभिप्रेक्ष्य सव्रीडमिदमब्रवीत्॥<br />Having withdrawn his soldiers, Drona, with a dejected heart, seeing Duryodhana, spoke these words in shame.</p>
<p id='3'>उक्तमेतन्मया पूर्वं न तिष्ठति धनंजये। शक्यो ग्रहीतुं संग्रामे देवैरपि युधिष्ठिरः॥<br />‘I have told you before, that when Dhananjaya stays by the side of Yudhishthira, even the celestials will not be able to capture the latter in battle.</p>
<p id='4'>इति तद् वः प्रयततां कृतं पार्थेन संयुगे। मा विशङ्कीर्वचो मह्यमजेयौ कृष्णपाण्डवौ॥<br />You all assaulted Partha in battle, but he defeated all of you; do not doubt my words; Krishna and the son of Pandu are incapable of being vanquished in battle.</p>
<p id='5'>अपनीते तु योगेन केनचिच्छ्वेतवाहने। तत एष्यति मे राजन् वशमेष युधिष्ठिरः॥<br />If however by any means Arjuna owning white steeds cab be taken away from the side of Yudhishthira , then, O king, even today may Yudhishthira be brought under your sway.</p>
<p id='6'>कश्चिदाहूय तं संख्ये देशमन्यं प्रकर्षतु। तमजित्वा न कौन्तेयो निवर्तेत कथंचन॥<br />Let some one challenging him (Arjuna) in battle take him to another part of the field. The son of Kunti will not return without having vanquished him.</p>
<p id='7'>एतस्मिन्नन्तरे शून्ये धर्मराजमहं नुप। ग्रहीष्यामि चमूं भित्त्वा धृष्टद्युम्नस्य पश्यतः॥<br />O monarch, during that interval when Yudhishthira will be deprived of the help of Arjuna, I, penetrating through the Pandava hosts, will capture the very virtuous king, even before the very eyes of Dhrishtadyumna.</p>
<p id='8'>अर्जुनेन विहीनस्तु यदि नोत्सृजते रणम्। मामुपायान्तमालोक्य गृहीतं विद्धि पाण्डवम्॥<br />Thus, O monarch, I will today with certitude bring under your control Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, with all his followers.</p>
<p id='9'>एवं तेऽहं महाराज धर्मपुत्रं युधिष्ठिरम्। समानेष्यामि सगणं वशमद्य न संशयः॥ यदि तिष्ठति संग्रामे मुहूर्तमपि पाण्डवः। अथापयाति संग्रामाद् विजयात् तद् विशिष्यते॥<br />If, in battle, that son of Pandu stays only for one moment (before me) then I will bring him (a captive) from the field; surely that achievement will be more advantage than victory over the hostile army.'</p>
<p id='10'>संजय उवाच द्रोणस्य तद् वचः श्रुत्वा त्रिगर्ताधिपतिस्तदा। भ्रातृभिः सहितो राजन्निदं वचनमब्रवीत्॥<br />Sanjaya said Thereat, having listened to these words of Drona, the ruler of the Trigarttas united with his brothers, spoke these words, O monarch.</p>
<p id='11'>वयं विनिकृता राजन् तदा गाण्डीवधन्वना। अनाग:स्वपि चागस्तत् कृतमस्मासु तेन वै॥<br />'O monarch, we have been very often humiliated by the wielder of the Gandiva bow; O foremost of the Bharatas, though we have done him no harm yet he bears malice against us.</p>
<p id='12'>ते वयं स्मरमाणास्तान् विनिकारान् पृथग्विधान्। क्रोधाग्निना दह्यमाना न शेमहि सदा निशि॥<br />We, remembering those various occasions of humiliation, are ever consumed with the fire of wrath and at night can never enjoy sleep.</p>
<p id='13'>स नो दिष्ट्यास्त्रसमपन्नश्चक्षुर्विषयमागतः। कर्तारः स्म वयं कर्म यच्चिकीर्षाम हृद्गतम्॥<br />By good fortune it is that Arjuna bearing arms, will become the object of our sight; so we will achieve that feat which our hearts long to accomplish.</p>
<p id='14'>भवतश्च प्रियं यत् स्यादस्माकं च यशस्करम्। वयमेनं हनिष्यामो निकृश्यायोधनाद् बहिः॥<br />This act will be agreeable to you and shall redound to our renown. Drawing him out of the field of battle we shall slay him.</p>
<p id='15'>अद्यास्त्वनर्जुना भूमिरत्रिगर्ताऽथ वा पुनः। सत्यं ते प्रतिजानीमो नैतन्मिथ्या भविष्यति॥<br />Today the earth will be relieved of the burden of Arjuna or that of the Trigarttas. Truly we resolve this before you and this our resolution will never be falsified?</p>
<p id='16'>एवं सत्यरथश्चोक्त्वा सत्यवर्मा च भारत। सत्यव्रतश्च सत्येषुः सत्यकर्मा तथैव च॥ सहिता भ्रातरः पञ्च स्थानामयुतेन च। न्यवर्तन्त महाराज कृत्वा शपथमाहवे॥<br />Satyaratha, Satyavarman, Satyavrata, Satyashu and Satyakarman, O Bharata, having spoken in the same manner. Those five brothers, with their ten thousand cars, retired, O monarch, having taken that oath on the field of battle.</p>
<p id='17'>मालवास्तुण्डिकेराश्च रथानामयुतैस्त्रिभिः। सुशर्मा च नरव्याघ्रस्त्रिगर्तः प्रस्थलाधिपः॥ मावेल्लकैललित्यैश्च सहितो मद्रकैरपि। रथानामयुतेनैव सोऽगमद् भ्रातृभिः सह॥<br />The Malavas and the Tundikeras, with thirty thousand cars and that foremost of men Susharman of the Trigartta race, the ruler of Prasthala together with the Mavelakas the Lalithyas and the Madrakas and with ten thousand cars and accompanied by his biothers.</p>

<p id='23'>ब्राह्मणांस्तर्पयित्वा च निश्कान् दत्त्वा पृथक् पृथक्। गाश्च वासांसि च पुन: समाभाष्य परस्परम्॥ प्रज्वाल्य कृष्णवनिमुपागम्य रणव्रतम्। तस्मिन्नग्नौ तदा चक्रुः प्रतिज्ञां दृढनिश्चयाः॥<br />Those heroes having gratified the Brahmanas by giving them golden coin separately and also kine and garments and having addressed one another in loving words, and having kindled the fire, took that oath in the field of battle; then in the presence of that fire they took that oath with a great firmness of resolution.</p>
<p id='24'>शृण्वतां सर्वभूतानामुच्चैर्वाचो बभाषिरे। सर्वे धनंजयवधे प्रतिज्ञां चापि चक्रिरे॥<br />Having formed that firm resolution for the death of Dhananjaya they said these words aloud in the hearing of all present.</p>
<p id='25'>ये वै लोकाश्चावतिनां ये चैव ब्रह्मघातिनाम्। मद्यपस्य च ये लोका गुरुदाररतस्य च॥ ब्रह्मस्वहारिणश्चैव राजपिण्डापहारिणः। शरणागतं च त्यजतो याचमानं तथा मतः॥ अगारदाहिनां चैव ये च गां निजतामपि। अपकारिणां च ये लोका ये च ब्रह्मद्विषामपि॥ स्वभार्यामृतुकालेषु मोहाद् वै नाभिगच्छताम्। श्राद्धमैथुनिकानां च ये चाप्यात्मापहारिणाम्॥ न्यासापहारिणां ये च श्रुतं नाशयतां च ये। क्लीबेन युध्यमानानां ये च नीचानुसारिणाम्॥ नास्तिकानां च ये लोकायेऽग्निमातृपितृत्यजाम्। तानाप्नुयामहे लोकान् ये च पापकृतामपि॥ यद्यहत्वा वयं युद्धे निवर्तेम धनंजयम्। तेन चाभ्यर्दितास्त्रासाद् भवेम हि पराङ्मुखाः॥<br />Thosc regions that are for the liars, those that are for the Brahminicides, those that are for the drunkards, those that are for a person who has illicit intercourse with the wife of his preceptor. Those that are for him who robs a Brahmana of his property or for him who enjoys the king's allowance (without fulfiling the conditions thereof) or for him who forsakes one seeking shelter in him or for him who slays one asking for favours. Those regions that are for the incendiary, or for the slayer of the kine, or for him that does injury to others or for him thai nourishes ill-will against the Brahınanas. Those regions that are for him who, out of foolishness, does not hold sexual intercourse with his wife during her season, those also that are for men who indulge in sexual intercourse on the day they have to perform a Shraddha, those that are for people who injure their own soul; those that are for men who appropriate things deposited with them out of trust or for those who destroy knowledge or for those who fight with the eunuchs or for those that follow thic mean; those regions that are for the atheists or those that arc for people who abandon the Fires and their own mother or those that are for the sinful,-those regions shall be ours. If we return from the field of battle without having slain Dhananjaya or if afflicted by him we, out of terror, turn away our faces from the field.</p>
<p id='26'>यदि त्वसुकरं लोके कर्म कुर्याम संयुगे। इष्टॉल्लोकान् प्राप्तुमानो वयमद्य न संशयः॥<br />If, on the other hand, we can accomplish in battle that feat difficult of achieving, then, for certain, today we shall attain to the most desirable regions.</p>
<p id='27'>एवमुक्त्वा तदा राजंस्तेऽभ्यवर्तन्त संयुगे। आट्ठयन्तोऽर्जुनं वीराः पितृजुष्टां दिशं प्रति॥<br />O monarch, having thus spoken, they then proceeded to the fight summoning Arjuna to the southern part of the field.</p>

<p id='29'>आहूतो न निवर्तेयमिति मे व्रतमाहितम्। संशप्तकाश्च मां राजन्नाह्वयन्ति महामृधे॥<br />'Challenged, I will never turn back. This is my firm resolution. These Samshaptakas (those who are sworn to die or to conquer) O king, are calling me to meet them in battle.</p>

<p id='32'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच श्रुतं ते तत्त्वतस्तात यद् द्रोणस्य चिकीर्षितम्। यथा तदनृतं तस्य भवेत् तत् त्वं समाचर॥<br />Yudhishthira said O child, you are perfectly aware of what Drona is intent on doing. Act in such a manner so that his intention may be frustrated.</p>
<p id='33'>द्रोणो हि बलवाञ्छूरः कृतास्त्रश्च जितश्रमः। प्रतिज्ञातं च तेनैतद् ग्रहणं मे महारथ॥<br />Drona is endued with prowess and he is heroic, accomplished in the use of weapons, and indifatigable (in battle). O mighty carwarrior, even he has resolved to bring about my capture.</p>
<p id='34'>अर्जुन उवाच अयं वै सत्यजिद् राजन्नद्य त्वां रक्षिता युधि। ध्रियमाणे च पाञ्चाल्ये नाचार्यः काममाप्स्यति॥<br />Arjuna said This Satyajit, O monarch, will protect you in battle today; and so long as the prince of the Panchalas lives, the preceptor will not attain the fruition of his desires,</p>
<p id='35'>हते तु पुरुषव्याघ्ने रणे सत्यजिति प्रभो। सर्वैरपि समेतैर्वा न स्थातव्यं कथंचन॥<br />If, on the other hand, O master, this foremost of men, Satyajit, be slain in battle, then you shall not stay in the field even if surrounded by all (our warriors).</p>
<p id='36'>संजय उवाच अनुज्ञातस्ततो राज्ञा परिष्वक्तश्च फाल्गुनः। प्रेम्णा दृष्टश्च बहुधा ह्याशिषश्चास्य योजिताः॥<br />Sanjaya said Then king Yudhishthira gave Phalguna the permission he sought; and embraced him and cast affectionate glances him and pronounced numerous benedictions on him.</p>
<p id='37'>विहायैनं ततः पार्थस्त्रिगर्तान् प्रत्ययाद् बली। क्षुधितः क्षुद्विघातार्थं सिंहो मृगगणानिव॥<br />Having made these arrangement, puissant son of Pritha went to meet the Trigarttas, like a hungry lion falling upon a herd of deer, for assuaging its hunger.</p>
<p id='38'>ततो दोर्योधनं सैन्यं मुदा परमया युतम्। ऋतेऽर्जुनं भृशं क्रुद्ध धर्मराजस्य निग्रहे॥<br />on Thereafter the army of Duryodhana highly delighted at the absence of Arjuna from Yudhishthira's side, became infuriated at the thought of the capture of the virtuous monarch.</p>
<p id='39'>ततोऽन्योन्येन ते सैन्ये समाजग्मतुरोजसा। गङ्गासरय्वौ वेगेन प्रावृषीवोल्वणोदके॥<br />Thereupon both armies clashed against each other with great vehemence, like the conflux of the rivers Ganga and Sarayu in the rainy season, when they are both swollen with water.</p>
