<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>साद्रिद्वीपार्णववनां रथघोषेण नादयन्। स शिबिर्वैरिपून् नित्यं मुख्यान् निघ्नन् सपत्नजित्॥<br />He made the earth with her mountain and the islands and seas and forests resound with the clatter of his car-whecls.

Indeed Ushinara's son Sini gave away as presents as many kine as is the number of rain drops showered on the earth or the number of stars in the firmament or the number of sand grains on the bed of the river Ganga, or the number of stones that compose the mount Meru or the number of gems or aquatic animals in the ocean. The Lord of creation has not come across or will not come across, in the past, the present or the future, another king competent to bear the burden that king Sini bore on his shoulders. The sacrifices celebrated by king Sini were numerous and attended with all sorts of rites.</p>

<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>पिबत स्नात खादध्वमिति यद् रोचते जनाः। यस्मै प्रादाद् वरं रुद्रस्तुष्टः पुण्येन कर्मणा॥<br />"Drink" "bathe" 'eat' and 'do as like,' these were the words that used to be heard there. Pleased with his deeds of piety, Rudra</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>अक्षयं ददतो विततं श्रद्धा कीर्तिस्तथा क्रियाः। यथोक्तमेव भूतानां प्रियत्वं स्वर्गमुत्तमम्॥<br />“As you give away numerous presents, let your wealth, your devotion, your renown, your meritorious deeds, the love that people cherish for you and the paradise that you shall attain to, let all these of yours, be inexhaustible.”</p>
