Tell me that truly, 0 child.</p>
<p id='2'>यदि सौभपतिर्भद्र नियोक्तव्यो मतस्तव नियोक्ष्यति महात्मा स रामस्त्वद्धितकाम्यया।॥<br />If in your opinion gentle lady, the lord of the Suabhas should be urged, the great-souled Rama, desirous of your good, will urge him.</p>
<p id='3'>अथापगेयं भीष्मं त्वं रामेणेच्छसि धीमता। रणे विनिर्जितं द्रष्टुं कुर्यात् तदपि भार्गवः॥<br />Or if you desire to see the blamable Bhishma vanquished in battle by the wise Rama, he, of Bhrigu's family, will do that too.</p>
<p id='4'>सृञ्जयस्य वचः श्रुत्वा तव चैव शुचिस्मिते। यदत्र ते भृशं कार्यं तदद्यैव विचिन्त्यताम्॥<br />Hearing the words of Srinjaya, and of yours, O you of beautiful smiles, let what ought to be done this very day be settled.</p>
<p id='5'>अम्बोवाच अपनीताऽस्मि भीष्मेण भगवन्नविजानता। नाभिजानाति मे भीष्मो ब्रह्मन् शाल्वगतं मनः॥<br />Amba said Led away I had been by Bhishma, but he knew not the true state of my feelings. Bhishma did not know, O Brahmana, that my mind learned towards Shalva.</p>
<p id='6'>एतद् विचार्य मनसा भवानेतद् विनिश्चयम्। विचिनोतु यथान्यायं विधानं क्रियतां तथा॥<br />Thinking of this in your mind you should settle about this; do what you think is just.</p>
<p id='7'>भीष्मे वा कुरुशार्दूले शाल्वराजेऽथवा पुनः। उभयोरेव वा ब्रह्मन् युक्त यत् तत् समाच॥<br />Do that wish is just and reasonable towards that best among the Kurus and to the king Shalva or to both.</p>

<p id='9'>अकृतव्रण उवाच उपपन्नमिदं भद्रे यदेवं वरवर्णिनि। धर्मं प्रति वचो ब्रूयाः शृणु चेदं वचो मम॥<br />Akritavrana said It is indeed praiseworthy, gentle lady, that you are speaking these words with your eye towards virtue, O you of fair complexion; listen to these words of mine.</p>
<p id='10'>यदि त्वामापगेयो वै न नयेद् गजसाह्वयम्। शाल्वस्त्वां शिरसा भीरु गृह्णीयाद् रामचोदितः॥<br />If the blamable one had not led you to the city called after the elephant, Shalva would have accepted you, O timid lady, with his head bowed down, urged by Rama.</p>
<p id='11'>तेन त्वं निर्जिता भद्रे यस्मानीताऽसि भाविनि। संशयः शाल्वराजस्य तेन त्वयि सुमध्यमे॥<br />But since you, gentle lady, had been taken away by him after gaining a victory, O romantic lady, the king Shalva has therefore doubts in you, o you of beautiful waist.</p>
<p id='12'>भीष्मः पुरुषमानी च जितकाशी तथैव च। युक्ता भीष्मे कारयितुं तव॥<br />Bhishma is proud of his bravery and success and therefore it stands to reason that your remedy lies in Bhishma.</p>
<p id='13'>अम्बोवाच ममाप्येष सदा ब्रह्मन् हृदि कामोऽमिवर्तते। घातयेयं यदि रणे भीष्ममित्येव नित्यदा॥ तस्मात् प्रतिक्रिया<br />Amba said This desire has ever obtained in my heart. O Brahmana, that I would have but Bhishma slain in battle.</p>
<p id='14'>भीष्मं वा शाल्वराजं वा यं वा दोषेण गच्छसि। प्रशाधि तं महाबाहो यत्कृतेहं सुदुःखिता॥<br />Whoever is blamable, Bhishma to the king of the Shalvas, punish him who has brought about this great distress, O you of long arms.</p>
<p id='15'>भीष्म उवाच एवं कथयतामेव तेषां स दिवसो गतः। रात्रिश्च भरतश्रेष्ठ सुखशीतोष्णमारुता॥<br />Bhishma said The day passed away while they were conversing on this as also the night which was marked by pleasant breezes that were neither too hot nor too cold, O chief among the Bharatas.</p>
<p id='16'>ततो रामः प्रादुरासीत् प्रज्वलन्निव तेजसा। शिष्यैः परिवृतो राजन् जटाचीरधरो मुनिः॥<br />Then did Rama come there as if blazing with energy, the anchorite having matted hairs wearing deer skin was surrounded by his disciples.</p>
<p id='17'>धनुष्पाणिरदीनात्मा खङ्गं बिभ्रत् परश्वधी। विरजा राजशार्दूल सृञ्जयं सोऽभ्ययानृपम्॥<br />The great-souled one came, bow in hand, and holding a sword and battle-axe; and the sinless one approached that ruler of men, Srinjaya, O best among kings.</p>
<p id='18'>ततस्तं तापसा दृष्ट्वा स च राजा महातपाः। तस्थुः प्राञ्चलयो राजन् सा च कन्या तपस्विनी॥<br />Seeing him the ascetics and the king of great asceticism stood up with clasped hands; so also did that girl.</p>
<p id='19'>पूजयामासुरव्यचा मधुपर्केण भार्गवम्। अर्चितश्च यथान्यायं न पिसाद सहैव तैः॥<br />Earnestly they adored him of the Bhrigu race, with honey and curds and being duly honored he sat down with them.</p>
<p id='20'>ततः पूर्वव्यतीतानि कथयन्तौ स्म तावुभौ। आसातां जामदग्न्यश्च सृञ्जयश्चैव भारत॥<br />Then the two Srinjaya and the son of Jamadagna, sat together conversing on past matters.</p>
<p id='21'>तथा कथान्ते राजर्षि गुश्रेष्ठं महाबलम्। उवाच मधुरं काले रामं वचनमर्थवत्॥<br />At the end of their discourse, the royal sage in proper time said these sweet words pregnant with meaning to Rama, the foremost in the race of Bhrigu, endued with great strength.</p>
<p id='22'>रामेयं मम दौहित्री काशिराजसुता प्रभो। अस्याः शृणु यथातत्त्वं कार्यं कार्यविशारद॥<br />O Rama this is my grand daughter, the daughter of the king of the Kashis, my lord; hear what she has to say and settle what can be done for her, O you skillful in deeds.</p>

<p id='24'>ततोऽभिवाद्य चरणौ रामस्य शिरसा शुभौ। स्पृष्ट्वा पद्मदलामाभ्यां पाणिभ्यामग्रतः स्थिता॥<br />Saluting the holy feet of Rama with her head she touched them with her lotus like hands and stood in front of him.</p>
<p id='25'>सरोद सा शोकवती बाष्पव्याकुललोचना। प्रपेदे शरणं चैव शरण्यं भृगुनन्दनम्॥<br />Being stricken with grief she wept aloud and with her eyes bathed in tears she betook herself to the refuge of the delighter of Bhrigu's race who was of a worthy refuge.</p>

<p id='27'>अम्बोवाच भगवशरणं त्वाद्य प्रपन्नाऽस्मि महाव्रतम्। शोकपङ्कार्णवान्मग्नां घोरादुद्धर मां विभो॥<br />Amba said My lord, I be take myself now to your refuge for you are of great vows, Tell me, my lord, who am fallen into the mire of grief and liberate me from the heavy calamity.</p>
<p id='28'>भीष्म उवाच तस्याश्च दृष्ट्वा रूपं च वपुश्चाभिनवं पुनः। सौकुमार्यं परं चैव रामश्चिन्तापरोऽभवत्॥<br />Bhishma said Seeing her beauty and again her youthful person and her extreme delicacy of mold, Rama became engaged in deep thought.</p>
<p id='29'>किमियं वक्ष्यतीत्येवं विममर्श भृगूद्वहः। इति दध्यौ चिरं रामः कृपयाभिपरिप्लुतः॥<br />"What shall this one say?" So thought Bhrigu; thinking thus Rama was silent for a long time filled with pity.</p>
<p id='30'>कथ्यतामिति सा भूयो रामेणोक्ता शुचिस्मिता। सर्वमेव यथातत्त्वं कथयामास भार्गवे॥<br />The lady, of sweet smiles being again asked to recite her story, said everything as had happened to him of Bhrigu's race.</p>
<p id='31'>तच्छ्रुत्वा जामदग्न्यस्तु राजपुत्र्या वचस्तदा। उवाच ता वरारोहां निश्चित्यार्थविनिश्चयम्॥<br />The son of Jamadagni too hearing those words of the princess first settled as to what he should do and then said to her of beautiful hips.</p>

<p id='33'>न चेत् करिष्यति वचो मयोक्तं जाह्नवीसुतः। धक्ष्याम्यहं रणे भद्रे सामात्यं शस्त्रतेजसा॥<br />If the son of Jahnavi does not do what I say then shall I consume him in battle, O gentle lady, along with his ministers, by the blaze of my weapons.</p>
<p id='34'>अथवा ते मतिस्तत्र राजपुत्रि न वर्तते। यावच्छाल्वपतिं वीरं योजनयाम्यत्र कर्माणि॥<br />If, O princess, you are not of that opinion, I shall urge that hero, the king of the Shalvas, to the present matter.</p>
<p id='35'>अम्बोवाच विसर्जिताऽहं भीष्मेण श्रुत्वैव भृगुनन्दन। शाल्वराजगतं भावं मम पूर्वं मनीषितम्॥<br />Amba said O delighter of Bhrigu's race, I had been dismissed by Bhishma as soon as he heard that my mind already had been to the king of the Shalvas.</p>

<p id='40'>स हि लुब्धश्च नीचश्च जितकाशी च भार्गव। तस्मात् प्रतिक्रिया कर्तुं युक्ता तस्मै त्वयाऽघ॥<br />He is covetous, mean, spirited, and boastful of success, O you of Bhrigu's race; therefore is it reasonable that you should take revenge on him, O sinless one.</p>
<p id='41'>एष मे क्रियमाणाया भारतेन तदा विभो। अभवद्भदि संकल्पो घातयेयं महाव्रतम्॥<br />When I was being taken away by Bharata, my lord, I made this resolution in my heart, namely, that I should cause this one of great vows to be slain.</p>
<p id='42'>तस्मात् कामं ममायेमं राम सम्पादयानघ। जहि भीष्मं महाबाहो यथा वृत्रं पुरंदरः॥<br />Therefore do you fulfill this desire of mine, O sinless Rama; slay Bhishma, O you of long arms, as Purandara slew Vritra.</p>
