<p id='7'>भूयिष्ठेन तु राजानः श्रियं भुक्त्वाऽऽयुषः क्षये। तरुणाः प्रतिपद्यन्ते भोक्तुं सुकृतदुष्कृते॥<br />The kings, enjoying great prosperity up to the end of their lives, are born anew to enjoy the effects of their good and bad deeds.</p>
<p id='8'>स भवान् धर्मपुत्रेण शमं कर्तुमिहार्हति। पाण्डवाः कुरवश्चैव पालयन्तु वसुंधराम्॥<br />Therefore it is proper for your exalted self to effect peace with Yudhishthira. Let the Pandavas and the Kurus rule the universe.</p>
<p id='9'>बलवानहमित्येव न मन्तव्यं सुयोधन। बलवन्तो बलिभ्यो हि दृश्यन्ते पुरुषर्षभ॥<br />"I am strong", it should not be thought thus, O Suyodhana, for some parties are seen who are stronger than those among men.</p>
<p id='10'>न बलं बलिनां मध्ये बलं भवति कौरव। बलवन्तो हि ते सर्वे पाण्डवा देवविक्रमाः॥<br />Among the really strong, physical strength does not count, O son of Kuru and all the sons of Pandu, who are endued with the strength of the gods, are strong.</p>
<p id='11'>अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। मातलेर्दातुकामस्य कन्या मृगयतो वरम्॥<br />In this connection is cited the old story of Matali who was desirous of giving away his daughter in marriage and was searching for a bridegroom.</p>

<p id='17'>देवमानुषलोकौ द्वौ मानुषेणैव चक्षुषा। अवगाह्मैव विचितौ न च मे रोचते वरः॥<br />By my human eyes have I searched the two worlds, those of the celestial and human beings and there is no suitable husband for my daughter that pleases me.</p>
<p id='18'>कण्व उवाच न देवान् नैव दितिजान् न गन्धर्वान् न मानुषान्। अरोचयद् वरकृते तथैव बहुलानृषीन्॥<br />Kanva said Among the gods, among those born in the Daitya race, among the Gandharvas and among human beings there was none who pleased him enough t be made the husband of his daughter. The same was the case with the numerous Rishis.</p>
<p id='19'>भार्ययाऽनु स सम्मन्त्र्य सह रात्रौ सुधर्मया। मातलि गलोकाय चकार गमने मतिम्॥<br />Having consulted with his wife, Sudharma, at night (one day), Matali made up his mind to enter the world of the Nagas.</p>
<p id='20'>न मे देवमनुष्येषु गुणकेश्याः समो वरः। रूपतो दृश्यते कश्चिन्नागेषु भविता ध्रुवम्॥<br />Matali said Among gods and men I d not find a suitable husband for Gunakeshi in point of beauty. There must be some one so suitable among the Nagas.</p>
<p id='21'>इत्यामन्त्र्य सुधर्मा स कृत्वा चाभिप्रदक्षिणम्। कन्यां शिरस्युपाध्राय प्रविवेश महीतलम्॥<br />Thus thinking he bade adieu to Sudharma; and, going round his superiors and having smelt the head of his daughter entered the nether regions.</p>
