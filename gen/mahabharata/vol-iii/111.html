He has been made subject to the Fates by Providence. Therefore speak on; I am patiently hearing you.</p>
<p id='2'>विदुर उवाच अप्राप्तकाल वचनं बृहस्पतिरपि ब्रुवन्। लभते बुद्ध्यवज्ञानमवमानं च भारत॥<br />Vidura said Even Brihaspati by speaking when suitable time has not come gets a charge of ignorance and insult, O Bharata.</p>

By his abandonment (you will see) the proper development of your hundred sons; and by not abandoning him, there will be the destruction of your hundred sons.</p>
<p id='6'>न वृद्धिर्बहु मन्तव्या या वृद्धिः क्षयमावहेत्। क्षयोऽपि बहु मन्तव्यो यः क्षयो वृद्धिमावहेत्॥<br />That gain should not be highly thought of, which brings on a little loss; and that loss should be considered a great one, which brings on a little gain.</p>
<p id='7'>न स क्षयो महाराज यः क्षयो वृद्धिमावहेत्। क्षयः स त्विह मन्तव्यो लङ्वा बहु नाशयेत्॥<br />That, O great king, is not loss which brings on gain; but that should be regarded as loss which being gained causes much loss.</p>
