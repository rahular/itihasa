This evil-souled one, of an envious disposition and vain, he would not listen to the advice of his elders.</p>

<p id='13'>वैचित्रवीर्यं पुरुषाः क्रोधहर्षसमावृताः। सिता बहुविधैः पाशैर्ये न तुष्टाः स्वकैर्धनैः॥ यमस्य वशमायान्ति काममूढाः पुनः पुनः। अन्धनेत्रा यथैवान्धा नीयमानाः स्वकर्मभिः॥<br />O son of Vichitravirya, men are surrounded with joy and wrath and so they are entangled in several sorts of trap. Those, who are not satisfied with their own wealth and those fools who act by desire, again and again come under the influence of the god of death in consequence of their own acts like those of blind eyes (falling again and again into pits) when led by the blind.</p>

<p id='20'>अप्राप्यः केशवो राजनिन्द्रियैरजितैर्नृभिः। आगमाधिगमाद् योगाद् वशी तत्त्वे प्रसीदति॥<br />Keshava is unattainable, o king, by men who have not controlled their senses. One who has his soul under control is pleased with true knowledge, gained by devotion and intimate knowledge of the holy books.</p>
