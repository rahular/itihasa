<h3>BHAGAVAD-YANA PARVA: Chapter 107</h3><h4>The story of Galava</h4><p id='1'>नारद उवाच एवमुक्तस्तदा तेन विश्वामित्रेण धीमता। नास्ते न शेते नाहारं कुरुते गालवस्तदा॥<br />Narada said Being thus commanded by the intelligent Vishvamitra Galava could not sit, nor sleep nor could he take his meals.</p>
<p id='2'>त्वगस्थिभूतो हरिणश्चिन्ताशोकपरायणः। शोचमानोऽतिमात्रं स दह्यमानश्च मन्युना। गालवो दुःखितो दुःखाद् विललाप सुयोधन॥<br />His body was reduced to a skeleton and became pale being subject to grief and a prey to excessive anxiety and burning with dissatisfaction. Galava, being very sorry, thus began to lament, O Suyodhana.</p>

Never before has anything been asked by me from the gods.</p>
