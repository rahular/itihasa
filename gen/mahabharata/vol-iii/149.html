<h3>BHAGAVAD-YANA PARVA: Chapter 79</h3><h4>Speech of Krishna</h4><p id='1'>श्रीभगवानुवाच एवमेतन्महाबाहो यथा वदसि पाण्डवा पाण्डवानां कुरूणां च प्रतिपत्स्ये निरामयम्॥<br />The blessed God said O you of long arms, it will be as you say, O Pandava. I shall accomplish what would be for the well being of the Pandavas and for the Kurus.</p>
<p id='2'>सर्वं त्विदं ममायत्तं बीभत्सो कर्मणोर्द्वयोः। क्षेत्रं हि रसवच्छुद्धं कर्मणैवोपपादितम्॥<br />Everything about these two acts (peace and war) is within my power. Land is moistened and purified (i.e. all weeds are rooted out of it) by action.</p>
<p id='3'>ऋते वर्षान्न कौन्तेय जातु निवर्तयेत् फलम्। तत्र वै पौरुषं ब्रूयुरासेकं यत्र कारितम्॥<br />But without rain, O son of Kunti, it cannot be made to yield crops. In that case ( i.e. if there is no rain) it is said that irrigation, which can be done men, ought to be resorted to.</p>
<p id='4'>तत्र चापि ध्रुवं पश्येच्छोषणं दैवकारितम्। तदिदं निश्चितं बुद्ध्या पूर्वैरपि महात्मभिः॥<br />But there even (i.e. even in artificial irrigation) you will surely behold draught brought on by divine agency (if He so will it). Knowing this to be the case, the great-souled ones of old.</p>
<p id='5'>दैवे च मानुषे चैव संयुक्तं लोककारणम्। अहं हि तत् करिष्यामि परं पुरुषकारतः॥<br />Have said that human affairs accomplished both by divine providence and by exertion on the part of man. This shall do only that which is capable of being done by human beings.</p>
<p id='6'>दैवं तु न मया शक्यं कर्म कर्तुं कथंचन। स हि धर्मं च लोकं च त्यक्त्वा चरति दुर्मतिः॥<br />What can be done only by divine agency can never be done by me. That wicked-minded are one acts without any regard to righteousness or to the world.</p>
<p id='7'>न हि संतप्यते तेन तथारूपेण कर्मणा। तथापि बुद्धि पापिष्ठा वर्धयन्त्यस्य मन्त्रिणः॥<br />And he dose not regret for doing that sort of acts; and his inclinations which are so vicious are supported by his advisers.</p>
<p id='8'>शकुनिः सूतपुत्रश्च भ्राता दुःशासनस्तथा। स हि त्यागेन राज्यस्य न शमं समुपैष्यति॥<br />(Who are) Shakuni, the son of Suta (Karna) and his brother Dushasana? He will not effect peace by giving up (any portion of) the kingdom.</p>
<p id='9'>अन्तरेण वधं पार्थ सानुबन्धः सुयोधनः। न चापि प्रणिपातेन त्यक्तुमिच्छति धर्मराट्। याच्यमानश्च राज्यं स न प्रदास्यति दुर्मतिः॥<br />Without the slaying of Suyodhana and his kinsmen, O son of Pritha, he dose not desire to give up (the kingdom), not even by our surrendering to him, O virtuous king. That evilminded one will not give you the kingdom by your asking for it.</p>
<p id='10'>मन्ये वाच्यो यद् युधिष्ठिरशासनम्। धर्मराजेन भारत॥<br />I think that Yudhishthira's message ought to be conveyed to him; what is necessary and proper has already been said by the virtuous king, O Bharata.</p>
<p id='11'>तथा पापस्तु तत् सर्वं न करिष्यति कौरवः। तस्मिश्चाक्रियमाणेऽसौ लोके वध्यो भविष्यति॥<br />The one who is such vicious inclinations will not do even that in its entirety, O son of Kuru; and he, refusing compliance with that will deserve death in this world.</p>
<p id='12'>मम चापि स वध्यो हि जगतश्चापि भारत। येन कौमारके यूयं सर्वे विप्रकृताः सदा॥<br />(In that case) he would deserve death at my hands and at the hands of the entire world. By him you all in your youth were ever persecuted.</p>
<p id='13'>विप्रलुप्तं च वो राज्यं नृशंसेन दुरात्मना। न चोपशाम्यते पापः श्रियं दृष्ट्वा युधिष्ठिरे॥ न तु स तद् उक्तं प्रयोजनं यत् तु<br />(And since) your kingdom has been wrested by means of deceit by that evil-souled one, who would not obtain peace at seeing prosperity in Yudhishthira.</p>
<p id='14'>असकृच्चाप्यहं तेन त्वत्कृते पार्थ भेदितः। न मया तद् गृहीत् च पापं तस्य चिकीर्षितम्॥<br />I, too, O son of Pritha, was sought to be withdrawn from four side by that vicious one; but that evil counsel of his was not accepted by me.</p>
<p id='15'>जानासि हि महाबाहो त्वमप्यस्य परं मतम्। प्रियं चिकीर्षमाणं च धर्मराजस्य मामपि॥<br />You, too, know, O you of long of arms, his dearly cherished intentions and purposes; and that the good of the king of virtue is ever desired to be accomplished by me.</p>
<p id='16'>संजास्तस्य चात्मानं मम चैव परं मतम्। अजानन्निव मां कस्मादर्जुनद्याभिशङ्कसे॥<br />Knowing then his purposes and my dearly cherished intentions, why do you, O Arjuna, seem to be afraid of me, as if you did not know them.</p>
<p id='17'>यच्चापि परमं दिव्यं तच्चाप्यनुगतं त्वया। विधानं विहितं पार्थ कथं शर्म भवेत् परैः॥<br />The one prime object, that has been ordained in Heaven, is known to you. How then can your advice of peace with the enemy be followed?</p>
<p id='18'>यत् तु वाचा शक्यं कर्मणा वाऽपि पाण्डव। करिष्ये तदहं पार्थ न त्वाशंसे शमं परैः॥<br />Whatever is capable of being done by me, by speech or by deed, O Pandava, shall be done by me, O son of Pritha, but do not expect peace with the enemy;</p>
<p id='19'>कथं गोहरणे ह्युक्तो नैतच्छर्म तथा हितम्। याच्यमानो हि भीष्मेण संवत्सरगतेऽध्वनि॥<br />Why was not this very peace, which is so beneficial, proposed by Bhishma and humbly besought by him at the time of attacking the cattle of Virata, which is now a year since, concluded?</p>
<p id='20'>तदैव ते पराभूता यदा संकल्पितास्त्वया। लवशः क्षणशश्चापि न च तुष्टः सुयोधनः॥<br />At that moment have they been vanquished, when their defeat has been determined on by you. Suyodhana is not satisfied at the prospect of parting with a small part of his kingdom for even a very brief period.</p>
<p id='21'>सर्वथा तु मया कार्यं धर्मराजस्य शासनम्। विभाव्यं तस्य भूयश्च कर्म पापं दुरात्मनः॥<br />The instructions of the king of virtue will always be attended to by me; and the wicked acts of that evil-souled one will have again to be considered by me.</p>
