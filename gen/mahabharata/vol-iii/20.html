<h3>KICHAKA-VADHA PARVA: Chapter 20</h3><h4>Words of Draupadi</h4><p id='1'>द्रौपद्युवाच अहं सैरन्ध्रवेषेण चरन्ती राजवेश्मनि। शौचदास्मि सुदेष्णाया अक्षधूर्तस्य कारणात्॥<br />Draupadi said Alas, on account of that one skilled in gambling I am under Sudeshna's command, dwelling in the palace in the guise of a Sairandhri.</p>
<p id='2'>विक्रियां पश्य मे तीव्रां राजपुत्र्याः परंतप। आत्मकालमुदीक्षन्ती सर्वं दुःखं किलान्तवत्।।२।<br />O repressor of foes, princess as I am, see what pitiful change has come upon me I am living in expectation of a hopeful future, but my misery has reached its extremity.</p>
<p id='3'>अनित्या किल मानामर्थसिद्धिर्जयाजयौ। इति कृत्वा प्रतीक्षामि भर्तृणामुदयं पुनः॥<br />Accomplishment of purposes and victory and defeat with regard to mortals are of short duration. Thinking this, I am expecting the return of prosperity to my husbands.</p>
<p id='4'>चक्रवत्परिवर्तन्ते ह्याश्च व्यसनानि च। इति कृत्वा प्रतीक्षामि भर्तृणामुदयं पुनः॥<br />Like a wheel prosperity and adversity revolve. Thinking this, I am expecting the return of prosperity to my husbands.</p>
<p id='5'>य एव हेतुर्भवति पुरुषस्य जयावहः। पराजये च हेतुश्च स इति प्रतिपालये। किं मां न प्रतिजानीषे भीमसेन मृतामिव॥<br />That which becomes a cause of a man's victory may become the cause of his defeat as well. I live in that hope.</p>
<p id='6'>दत्त्वा याचन्ति पुरुषा हत्वा वध्यन्ति चापरे। पातयित्वा च पात्यन्ते परैरिति च मे श्रुतम्॥ न दैवस्यातिभारोऽस्ति न चैवास्यातिवर्तनम्। इति चाप्यागमं भूयो दैवस्य प्रतिपालये॥<br />O Bhimasena, why do you not consider me as dead? I am told that persons that give may beg, persons that slaughter may be slaughtered by others, and that persons that ever throw others may be over-thrown by enemies. There is nothing difficult for destiny nor can any one over-rule destiny.</p>
<p id='7'>स्थितं पूर्वं जलं यत्र पुनस्तत्रैव गच्छति। इति पर्यायमिच्छन्ती प्रतीक्षे उदयं पुनः॥<br />It is with this hope, I am expecting the return of favorable fortune; once before where there was water, there comes it back again. Hoping for this change, I am awaiting the return of prosperity.</p>
<p id='8'>दैवेन किल यस्यार्थ: सुनीतोऽपि विपद्यते। दैवस्य चागमे यत्नस्तेन कार्यो विजानता॥<br />When a man's business, although brought into a stage of completion, is seen to be endangered then a wise man should strive hard for the getting of good fortune.</p>
<p id='9'>यत् तु मे वचनस्यास्य कथितस्य प्रयोजनम्। पृच्छ मां दु:खितां तत्त्वं पृष्टा चात्र ब्रवीमि ते॥<br />Immersed as I am in grief, whether you ask me or not I shall tell you in detail, the purpose of these words now spoken by me.</p>
<p id='10'>महिषी पाण्डुपुत्राणां दुहिता दुपदस्य च। इमामवस्थां सम्प्राप्ता मदन्या का जिजीविषेत्॥<br />Queen of the sons of Pandu, and daughter of Drupada, who else but me wishes to live, having been reduced to such a plight?</p>
<p id='11'>कुरून् परिभवेत् सर्वान् पञ्चालानपि भारत। पाण्डवेयांश्च सम्प्राप्तो मम क्लेशो ह्यरिंदम॥<br />() repressor of foes, this my misery surely brings humiliation, O Bharata, on all the Kurus, the Panchalas and the Pandavas.</p>
<p id='12'>भ्रातृभिः श्वशुरैः पुत्रैर्बहुभिः परिवारिता। एवं समुदिता नारी का त्वन्या दुःखिता भवेत्॥<br />Being surrounded by numerous brothers, father-in-law and sons and thus having ample cause for rejoicing what other woman but myself has become so miserable?</p>
<p id='13'>नूनं हि बालया धातुर्मया वै विप्रियं कृतम्। यस्य प्रसादाद् दुर्नीतं प्राप्तास्मि भरतर्षभ॥<br />O foremost of the Bharata race, certainly in my childhood I did some wrongful act to Dhata and through his displeasure I have fallen into such a woeful plight.</p>
<p id='14'>वर्णावकाशमपि मे पश्य पाण्डव यादृशम्। तादृशो मे न तत्रासीद् दुःखे परमके तदा॥<br />Behold, O son of Pandu, the paleness of my complexion which even in the extremely miserable life in the forest could not come over me.</p>
<p id='15'>त्वमेव भीम जानीषे यन्मे पार्थ सुखं पुरा। साहं दासीत्वमापन्ना न शान्तिमवशा लभे॥<br />O Pritha's son, it is you alone that know what happiness had I in my former days, O Bhima; even I, who was thus circumstance, have now sunk in slavery: paralysed in grief I cannot obtain rest.</p>
<p id='16'>नादैविकमहं मन्ये यत्र पार्थो धनंजयः। भीमधन्वा महाबाहुरास्ते छन्न इवानलः॥<br />As the mighty-armed and terrible bowman Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, lives here, like a fire covered over by ashes, then must I think that all these actions are due to Destiny.</p>
<p id='17'>अशक्या वेदितुं पार्थ प्राणिनां वै गतिर्नरैः। विनिपातमिमं मन्ये युष्माकं ह्यविचिन्तिततम्॥<br />O son of Pritha, it is not possible for people to understand the destiny of creatures. Therefore this your downfall, I think, could not have been thwarted by fore-thought.</p>
<p id='18'>यस्या मम मुखप्रेक्षा यूयमिन्द्रसमाः सदा। सा प्रेक्षे मुखमन्यासामवराणां वरा सती॥<br />Alas, she who has you all resembling Indra always to look after her comforts, even that one, who is so chaste and bears so lofty a station in life, is ministering to the comforts of others who are far below in rank to her.</p>
<p id='19'>पश्य पाण्डव मेऽवस्थां यथा नार्हामि वै तथा। युष्मासु ध्रियमाणेषु पश्य कालस्य पर्ययम्॥<br />Though all of you are alive, behold O Pandava, my plight. It is such as is quite undeserving of me. Lo! how times change.</p>
<p id='20'>यस्याः सागरपर्यन्ता पृथिवी वशवर्तिनी। आसीत् साद्य सुदेष्णाया भीताहं वशवर्तिनी॥<br />Alas! she, who had the entire earth as far as the verge of the sea under her command, is now living in fear of Sudeshna and in subjugation to her. a</p>
<p id='21'>यस्याः पुरःसरा आसन् पृष्ठतश्चानुगामिनः। साहमद्य सुदेष्णायाः पुरः पश्चाच्च गामिनी॥ इदं तु दुःखं कौन्तेय ममासा निबोध तत्।<br />Even she, who had number of dependents to walk both in van and rear, is now walking before and behind Sudeshna. O Kunti's son, listen to another grief of mine; it is unbearable to me.</p>
<p id='22'>या न जातु स्वयं पिंपे गात्रोद्वर्तनमात्मनः। अन्यत्र कुन्त्या भद्रं ते सा पिनष्यद्य चन्दनम्॥<br />Even she, who had never pounded unguents for herself except for Kunti, has been now pounding the sandal (for others) O! let good betide you.</p>
<p id='23'>पश्य कौन्तेय पाणी मे नैवाभूतां हि यौ पुरा। इत्यस्य दर्शयामास किणवन्तौ करावुभौ॥<br />O Kunti's son, behold these hands of mine, they were not so before.” Saying this she showed both of her hands marked with corns.</p>
<p id='24'>विभेमि कुन्त्या या नाहं युष्माकं वा कदाचन। साद्याग्रतो विराटस्य भीता तिष्ठामि किङ्करी॥<br />Even that one, who had never feared Kunti nor any of you, now stays a slave in fear before Virata,</p>
<p id='25'>किं नु वक्ष्यति सम्राण्मां वर्णकः सुकृतो न वा। नान्यपिष्टं हि मत्स्यस्य चन्दनं किल रोचते॥<br />(Always do I remain in fear thinking) what the king of kings will say to me as about the unguents if they are not well pounded; because the king of the Matsya's does not like the sandal pounded by others.</p>
<p id='26'>वैशम्पायन उवाच सा कीर्तयन्ती दुःखानि भीमसेनस्य भामिनी। सरोद् शनकैः कृष्णा भीमसेनमुदीक्षती॥<br />Vaishampayana said Narrating her woes to Bhimasena, O Bharata, the lady Krishna wept silently with her glance fixed on Bhimasena.</p>
<p id='27'>सा वाष्पकलया वाचा निःश्वसन्ती पुनः पुनः। हृदयं भीमसेनस्य घयन्तीदमब्रवीत्॥<br />She, with words tremulous with tears, and sighing repeatedly addressed Bhimasena thus powerfully moving his heart.</p>
<p id='28'>नाल्पं कृतं मया भीम देवानां किल्बिषं पुरा। अभाग्या यत्र जीवामि कर्तव्ये सति पाण्डव॥<br />O Bhima, surely had I committed many sinful acts to gods in my former days. Unfortunate as I am, I am still alive, my death is preferable to me, O Pandava.</p>
<p id='29'>वैशम्पायन उवाच ततस्तस्याः करौ सूक्ष्मौ किणबद्धौ वृकोदरः। मुखमानीय वै पल्या रुरोद परवीरहा॥<br />Then Vrikodara the slayer of hostile heroes, covering his face with the delicate hands of his wife, marked with scars, began to weep.</p>
<p id='30'>तौ गृहीत्वा च कौन्तेयो बाष्पमुत्सृज्य वीर्यवान्। ततः परमदुःखार्त इदं वचनमब्रवीत्॥<br />The powerful son of Kunti, having held both of her hands in his own, began to shed tears, and stricken with great woe spoke the following.</p>
