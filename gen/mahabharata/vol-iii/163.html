<h3>BHAGAVAD-YANA PARVA: Chapter 93</h3><h4>The conversation between Krishna and Vidura</h4><p id='1'>श्रीभगवानुवाच यथा ब्रूयान्महाप्राज्ञो यथा ब्रूयाद् विचक्षणः। यथा वाच्यस्त्वद्विधेन भवता मद्विधः सुहृत्॥<br />The blessed God said You have spoken as a greatly wise man should-you have spoken as a sharp man should, even as should be spoken by a friend like you to a friend like me.</p>
<p id='2'>धर्मार्थयुक्तं तथ्यं च यथा त्वय्युपद्यते। तथा वचनमुक्तोऽस्मि त्वयैतत् पितृमातृवत्॥<br />This has the merit of being conversant with morality and worldly good and truth to that degree which proper for you; the words which have been spoken by you are like the advice of a father or a mother.</p>
<p id='3'>सत्यं प्राप्तं च युक्तं वाप्येवमेव यथाऽऽत्थ माम्। शृणुष्वगमने हेतुं विदुरावहितो भव॥<br />What you have told me is true and worthy of being followed and is even what I have described it to be; listen with attention to the reason of my coming here, O Vidura.</p>
<p id='4'>दौरात्म्यं धार्तराष्ट्रस्य क्षत्रियाणां च वैरताम्। सर्वमेतदहं जानन् क्षत्तः प्राप्तोऽद्य कौरवान्॥<br />The wickedness of soul of the sons of Dhritarashtra and the hostility of the Kshatriyas, knowing full well, all this, 0 Khattva have I now come to the sons of Kuru.</p>
<p id='5'>पर्यस्तां पृथिवीं सर्वां साश्वां सरथकुञ्जराम्। यो मोचयेन्मृत्युपाशात् प्राप्नुयाद् धर्ममुत्तमम्॥<br />He that will relive this earth of her burden consisting of horses, chariots, elephants, he that will liberate her from curse of Death will earn great religious merit.</p>
<p id='6'>धर्मकार्यं यतञ्छक्त्या नो चेत् प्राप्नोति मानवः। प्राप्तो भवति तत् पुण्यमत्र मे नास्ति संशयः॥<br />Attempting with all his might to do a virtuous act, if a man does not accomplish it, he gets the religious merit of having done the act. About that I have no doubt.</p>
<p id='7'>मनसा चिन्तयन् पापं कर्मणा नातिरोचयन्। न प्राप्नोति फलं तस्येत्येवं धर्मविदो विदुः॥<br />Thinking of a sinful act in his mind, if a man does not accomplish it, he does not get the consequences of that act. Utter those that are conversant with religion.</p>
<p id='8'>सोऽहं यतिष्ये प्रशमं क्षत्तः कर्तुममायया। कुरूणां सृञ्जयानां च संग्रामे विनशिष्यताम्॥<br />Therefore shall I with all, sincerity try to establish peace, O Khattva among the Kurus and the Srinjayas, for they will meet with ruins in the case of war.</p>
<p id='9'>सेयमापन्महाघोरा कुरुष्वेव समुत्थिता। कर्णदुर्योधनकृता सर्वे ह्येते तदन्वयाः॥<br />This exceedingly grave calamity has its rise in the Kurus; for it has been brought about by Karna and Duryodhana. All these are but their followers.</p>
<p id='10'>व्यसने क्लिश्यमानं हि यो मित्रं नाभिपद्यते। अनुनीय यथाशक्ति तं नृशंसं विदुर्बुधाः॥<br />He, who does not seek to serve a friend suffering from a calamity by trying to the best of his abilities, is said to be a cruel man by the wise.</p>
<p id='11'>आकेशग्रहणान्मित्रमकार्यात् संनिवर्तयन्। अवाच्यः कस्यचिद् भवति कृतयत्नो यथाबलम्॥<br />A friend should be turned back from improper act even by seizing his hair. That being so, how can a man be blamed, if he strives with all his might.</p>
<p id='12'>तत् समर्थं शुभं वाक्यं धर्मार्थसहितं हितम्। धार्तराष्ट्रः सहामात्यो ग्रहीतुं विदुरार्हति॥<br />It is proper therefore, O Vidura, for the son of Dhritarashtra along with his ministers to accept my blessed advice capable of doing good and consistent with morality and worldly profit.</p>
<p id='13'>हितं हि धर्तराष्ट्राणां पाण्डवानां तथैव च। पृथिव्यां क्षत्रियाणां च यतिष्येऽहममायया॥<br />With all sincerity shall I strive for the good of the sons of Dhritarashtra and of the Pandavas and indeed of the Kshatriya race of the world.</p>
<p id='14'>हिते प्रयतमानं मां शङ्केद् दुर्योधनो यदि। हृदयस्य च मे प्रीतिरानृण्यं च भविष्यति॥<br />If Duryodhana suspects me, striving for his good as I do, I shall at least be satisfied with myself in my heart and I shall be discharging the debt (I owe them as a friend).</p>
<p id='15'>ज्ञातीनां हि मिथो भेदे यन्मित्रं नाभिपद्यते। सर्वयत्नेन माध्यस्थ्यं न तन्मित्रं विदुर्बुधाः॥<br />In a dispute between cousins, the friend who does not serve them as a mediator with all his might, is not said to be a friend at all by wise men.</p>
<p id='16'>न मां ब्रूयुरधर्मिष्ठा मूढा ह्यसुहृदस्तथा। शक्तो नावारयत् कृष्णः संरब्धान् कुरुपाण्डवान्॥<br />In order that unrighteous, foolish and unfriendly people may not call me that Krishna though competent did not dissuade the Kurus and Pandavas inspired with rage against each other.</p>
<p id='17'>उभयोः साधयन्नर्थमहमागत इत्युत। तत्र यत्नमहं कृत्वा गच्छेयं नृष्ववाच्यताम्॥<br />And for being of service to both the parties have I come here. And having made attempts in that direction I shall escape blame of men.</p>
<p id='18'>मम धर्मार्थयुक्तं हि श्रुत्वा वाक्यमनामयम्। न चेदादास्यते बालो दिष्टस्य वशमेष्यति॥<br />If after listening to my beneficial advice, they do not accept it, the fool will feel the consequence of his luck.</p>
<p id='19'>अहापयन् च्छमं कुरूणां यदि चाचरेयम्। पुण्यं च मे स्याच्चरितं महात्मन् मुच्येरंश्च कुरवो मृत्युपाशात्॥<br />If without sacrificing the interests of the Pandavas I can bring about their peace with the Kurus, then I shall have done a meritorious act, O great-souled one; and the Kurus shall have been liberated from the shackles of death.</p>
<p id='20'>अपि वाचं भाषमाणस्य काव्यां धर्मारामामर्थवतीमहिंस्राम्। अवेक्षेरन् धार्तराष्ट्राः शमार्थं मां च प्राप्तं कुरवः पूजयेयुः॥<br />If the son of Dhritarashtra think well of the wise words spoken by me-words having their source in virtue and words leading to earthly good and words heading to the reverse of malice, for bringing about peace, then the Kurus too will worship and honour me.</p>
<p id='21'>न चापि मम पर्याप्ताः सहिताः सर्वपार्थिवाः। क्रुद्धस्य प्रमुख स्थातु सिंहस्येवेतरे मृगाः॥<br />Otherwise I tell you that not even all the rulers of the earth united together are capable of standing in my front like other animals before an enraged lion.</p>
<p id='22'>वैशम्पायन उवाच इत्येवमुक्त्वा वचनं वृष्णीनामृषभस्तदा। शयने सुखसंस्पर्श शिश्ये यदुसुखावहः॥<br />Vaishampayana said Having said these words that foremost of the Vrishnis and cause of the happiness of the Yadus, then laid down on his bed pleasant to the touch.</p>
