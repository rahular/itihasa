<h3>AMBOPAKHYANA PARVA: Chapter 186</h3><h4>Story of the fight between Rama and Bhishma</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच ततो रात्रो व्यतीतायं प्रतिबुद्धोऽस्मि भारत। ततः संचिन्त्य वै स्वप्नमवापं हर्षमुत्तमम्॥<br />Bhishma said When they had passed away, I awoke. O Bharata; I was filled with great joy as I thought of the dream.</p>
<p id='2'>ततः समभवद् युद्धं मम तस्य च भारत। तुमुलं सर्वभूतानां लोमहर्षणमद्भुतम्॥<br />Then begin that mighty battle between him and me, O Bharata, which was wonderful and which made the hairs of all creatures stand on end.</p>
<p id='3'>ततो बाणमयं वर्ष ववर्ष मयि भार्गवः। न्यवारयमहं तच्च शरजालेन भारत॥<br />Then Bhargava rained on me a shower of arrows, which I baffled by a (like) shower of arrows, O Bharata.</p>
<p id='4'>ततः परमसंक्रुद्धः पुनरेव महातपाः। ह्यस्तनेन च कोपेन शक्ति वै प्राहिणोन्मयि॥<br />Thereupon he, of great asceticism, was greatly incensed and remembering what had happened the day before, he hurled, with anger, a dart at me,</p>
<p id='5'>इन्द्राशनिसमस्पर्शी यमदण्डसमप्रभाम्। ज्वलन्तीमग्निवत् संख्ये लेलिहानां समन्ततः॥<br />Which was as hard as Indra's thunderbolt, was equal in effulgence, to the mace of Yama, (god of death) blazing like a flaming fire and licking as it were with its tongue, all quarters of the battle-field.</p>
<p id='6'>पर्वतः॥ ततो भरतशार्दूल घिष्ण्यमाकाशगं यथा। स मामभ्यवधीत् तूर्णं जत्रुदेशे कुरूद्वह॥<br />Then, O best among Kurus, it struck me on my shoulder, even then, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, like a lightning ranging in the sky.</p>
<p id='7'>अथास्रमस्रवद् घोरं गिरेगैरिकधातुवत्। रामेण सुमहाबाहो क्षतस्य क्षतजेक्षण॥<br />Thus wondered by Rama, O red-eyed one of mighty arms, blood flowed freely like streams of red earth from a mountain.</p>
<p id='8'>ततोऽहं जामदग्न्याय भृशं क्रोधसमन्वितः। चिक्षेप मृत्युसंकाशं बाणं सर्पविषोपमम्॥<br />Greatly incensed , I darted, at the son of Jamadagni, a deadly shaft, comparable to the poison of a serpent only.</p>
<p id='9'>स तेनाभिहतो वीरो ललाटे द्विजसत्तमः। अशोभत महाराज सशृङ्ग इव<br />That hero, the best of the twice-born, struck by it on the forehead, shone beautiful as a mountain with its peak.</p>
<p id='10'>स संरब्धः समावृत्य शरं कालान्तकोपमम्। संदधे बलवत् कृष्य घोरं शत्रुनिबर्हणम्॥<br />Filled with great wrath he turned round, and drawing his bow with great strength aimed at me a terrible shaft, resembling death himself and capable of grinding all enemies.</p>
<p id='11'>स वक्षसि पपातोग्रः शरो व्याल इव श्वसन्। महीं राजंस्ततश्चाहमगमं रुधिराविलः॥<br />That fierce shaft struck me on the breast hissing (through the air) like a serpent, and I fell down to the earth, O king, covered with blood.</p>
<p id='12'>सम्प्राप्य तु पुनः संज्ञां जामदग्न्याय धीमते। प्राहिण्वं विमलां शक्तिं ज्वलन्तीमशनीमिव॥<br />Regaining my consciousness, I hurled at that intelligent son of Jamadagni a dart, bright and blazing as the lighting flesh.</p>
<p id='13'>सा तस्य द्विजमुख्यस्य निपपात भुजान्तरे। विह्वलश्चाभवद् राजन् वेपथुश्चैनमाविशत्॥<br />That dart fell on the chest of that best of Brahmanas. And, O king, having fainted (from pain) he began to tremble all over.</p>
<p id='14'>तत एनं परिष्वज्य सखा विप्रो महातपाः। अकृतव्रणः शुभैर्वाक्यैराश्वासयदनेकधा॥<br />Then his friend, that twice-born and great ascetic named Akritavrana, embraced him again and again and soothed him with words of auspicious import.</p>
<p id='15'>समाश्वस्तस्ततो रामः क्रोधामर्षसमन्वितः। प्रादुश्चक्रे तदा ब्राह्म परमास्त्रं महाव्रतः॥<br />Thus comforted, Rama was filled with anger and vindictiveness, and that keeper of all observances brought forth a mighty weapon of Brahma.</p>
<p id='16'>ततस्तत्प्रतिघातार्थं ब्राह्ममेवास्त्रमुत्तमम्। मया प्रयुक्तं जज्वाल युगान्तमिव दर्शयत्॥<br />Then, for the purpose of baffling also, I aimed the same excellent weapon of Brahma, which blazed forth, appearing like what happens at the end of the Yuga (at the final destruction).</p>
<p id='17'>तयोर्ब्रह्मास्त्रयोरासीदन्तरा वै समागमः। असंप्राप्यैव रामं च मां च भारतसत्तम॥<br />Then those two Brahmic weapons met each other in mid-air, without being able to reach either Rama or myself, 0 best of Bharata's race.</p>
<p id='18'>ततो व्योम्नि प्रादुरभूत् तेज एव हि केवलम्। भूतानि चैव सर्वाणि जग्मुराति विशाम्पते॥<br />Thereupon, in mid-welkin, only a flame blazed forth, and 0 lord of earth, all creatures becomes greatly afflicted,</p>
<p id='19'>ऋषयश्च सगन्धर्वा देवताश्चैव भारत। संतापं परमं जग्मुरस्त्रतेजोऽभिपीडिताः॥<br />The Rishis, and the gods together with the Gandharvas, 0 Bharata, became greatly afflicted, struck by the blazing effulgence.</p>

<p id='21'>प्रजज्वाल नमो राजन् धूमायन्ते दिशो दश। न स्थातुमन्तरिक्षे च शेकुराकाशगास्तदा॥<br />The firmament, О king, began to burn the ten points of the compass were filled with smoke. At that moment, those creatures that range the sky could not stay there.</p>
<p id='22'>ततो हाहाकृते लोके सदेवासुरराक्षसे। इदमन्तरमित्येवं मोक्तुकामोऽस्मि भारत॥<br />While during this time all creatures, with the gods, the Asuras and Rakshasas began uttering exclamations of woe, O Bharata, “This is the time,” thought I and become desirous of shooting,</p>
<p id='23'>प्रस्वापमस्त्रं त्वरितो वचनाद् ब्रह्मवादिनाम्। विचित्रं च तदस्त्रं मे मनसि प्रत्यभात् तदा॥<br />That weapon Prasvapa speedily, according to the words of command of the speakers of Brahma. And the Mantras also for using that weapon suddenly came to my mind.</p>
