<h3>SANJAYAYANA PARVA: Chapter 32</h3><h4>The words of Sanjaya</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच अनुज्ञातः पाण्डवेन प्रययौ संजयस्तदा। शासनं धृतराष्ट्रस्य सर्वं कृत्वा महात्मनः॥<br />Vaishampayana said Then did Sanjaya, permitted by the son of Pandu, depart, doing all the behest's of the great-souled Dhritarashtra.</p>
<p id='2'>सम्प्राप्य हास्तिनपुरं शीघ्रमेव प्रविश्य च। अन्तःपुरं समास्थाय द्वा:स्थं वचनमब्रवीत्॥<br />Having reached Hastinapura, he entered it quickly and standing at the gate (entrance of the) inner apartments of the palace said these words to the gate-keeper.</p>
<p id='3'>आचक्ष्व धृतराष्ट्राय द्वाःस्थ मां समुपागतम्। सकाशात् पाण्डुपुत्राणां संजयं मा चिरं कृथाः॥<br />Tell Dhritarashtra, O gate-keeper, that, I, Sanjaya, have returned from the presence of the sons of Pandu, delay not.</p>
<p id='4'>जागर्ति चेदभिवदेस्त्वं हि द्वाःस्थ प्रविशेयं विदितो भूमिपस्य। निवेद्यमत्रात्ययिकं हि मेऽस्ति द्वाःस्थोऽथ श्रुत्वा नृपति जगाम्॥<br />If he is awake, tell him this, O gate-keeper and make the ruler of the earth acquainted with (the news of) my entrance (into the city); I have business to submit to him. Hearing this, the gate-keeper went to the king.</p>
<p id='5'>द्वा:स्थ उवाच संजयोऽथ भूमिपते नमस्ते दिदृक्षया द्वारमुपागतस्ते। प्राप्तो दूतः पाण्डवानां सकाशात् राजन् किमयं करोतु।॥<br />The gate-keeper said O you lord of the earth, I bow down to you. Sanjaya is come to your door, desirous of an audience. He is arrived here as an envoy from the presence of the sons of Pandu. Command, O king, as to what he should do.</p>
<p id='6'>प्रशाधि है धृतराष्ट्र उवाच आचक्ष्व मां कुशलिनं कल्पमस्मै प्रवेश्यतां स्वागतं संजयाय। न चाहमेतस्य भवाम्यकल्पः स मे कस्माद् द्वारि तिष्ठेच्च सक्तः॥<br />Dhritarashtra said Inform him of my well-being. Let him enter. Welcome to Sanjaya. I am never unwilling to receive him, why does he, who can enter at any moment, stand at my door.</p>
<p id='7'>वैशम्पायन उवाच ततः प्रविश्यानुमते नृपस्य महद् वेश्म प्राज्ञशूरार्यगुप्तम्। सिंहासनस्थं पार्थिवमाससाद वैचित्रवीर्यं प्राञ्जलि: सूतपुत्रः॥<br />Vaishampayana said Then with the king's permission, the son of Suta having entered that large hall with clasped hands, approached the royal so Vichitravirya, seated on the throne and protected by wise men, heroes and honorable men.</p>
<p id='8'>संजय उवाच संजयोऽहं भूमिपते नमस्ते प्राप्तोऽस्मि गत्वा नरदेव पाण्डवान्। अभिवाद्य त्वां पाण्डुपुत्रो मनस्वी युधिष्ठिरः कुशलं चान्वपृच्छत्॥<br />Sanjaya said I am Sanjaya, I bow down to the lord of the earth. Setting out from here, I reached the sons of Pandu, O god among men. The spirited Yudhishthira having sent his greetings to you, afterwards asked me about your health.</p>
<p id='9'>स ते पुत्रान् पृच्छति प्रीयमाण: कच्चित् पुत्रैः परीयसे नप्तृभिश्च। तथा सुहृद्भिः सचिवैश्च राजन् ये चापि त्वामुपजीवन्ति तैश्च॥<br />And he gladly enquired about the health of your sons and asks you if you are pleased with your sons and son's sons and friends and ministers and all those who live dependent on you.</p>
<p id='10'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच अभिनन्द्यत्वां तात वदामि संजय अजातशत्रु च सुखेन पार्थम्। कच्चित् स राजा कुशली सपुत्रः सहामात्यः सानुजः कौरवाणाम्॥<br />Dhritarashtra said Blessing you, I say, O Sanjaya, is the son of Pritha he who creates no enemies, in happiness? Is that king of the Kauravas well with his sons, ministers and younger brothers.</p>
<p id='11'>संजय उवाच सहामात्यः कुशली पाण्डुपुत्रो बुभूषते यच्च तेऽग्रेऽऽत्मनोऽभूत्। निर्णिक्तधर्मार्थकरो मनस्वी बहुश्रुतो दृष्टिमाञ्छीलवांश्च॥<br />Sanjaya said With his ministers, the son of Pandu is in health; he desires that which was formerly his own, he who acquires virtue and wealth and commits no wrong deed, who is spirited, of great learning, of great fore-sight and of good behaviour.</p>
<p id='12'>परो धर्मात् पाण्डवस्यानृशंस्य धर्मः परो वित्तचयान्मतोऽस्या नपार्थेऽनुरुध्यते भारत तस्य बुद्धिः॥<br />With the sons of Pandu humanity is superior to virtue and in his opinion virtue is superior to the accumulation of wealth. He is inclined to the through, O son of Bharata, that happiness and joy are essential to virtue.</p>
<p id='13'>परप्रयुक्तः पुरुषो विचेष्टते सूत्रप्रोता दारुमयीव योषा। इमं दृष्ट्वा नियमं पाण्डवस्य मन्ये परं कर्म दैवं मनुष्यात्॥<br />Led by the will of God, a man acts like a wooden doll moved about by a thread. Seeing the sufferings of the son of Pandu I think that the ordinations of the gods have greater force than the exertions of man.</p>
<p id='14'>इमं च दृष्ट्वा तव कर्मदोषं पापोदकं घोरमवर्णरूपम्। यावत् परः कामयतेऽतिवेलं तावन्नरोऽयं लभते प्रशंसाम्॥<br />Seeing again your sinful deeds which will give rise to misery and which are eminently indescribable, (I am of opinion) that so long as a mighty foe waits for an opportunity, the other obtains praise.</p>
<p id='15'>अजातशत्रुस्तु विहाय पापं जीर्णां त्वचं सर्प इवासमाम्। विरोचतेऽहार्यवृत्तेन वीरो युधिष्ठिरस्त्वयि पापं विसृज्या॥<br />The hero Yudhishthira, who has created no enemies, casting away all sins as a snake does its worn out slough, which cannot remain on it, shines resplendent having transferred (the effect of) his sins to you.</p>
<p id='16'>हन्तात्मनः कर्म निबोध राजन् धर्मार्थयुक्तादार्यवृत्तादपेतम्। उपक्रोशं चेह गतोऽसि राजन् भूयश्च पापं प्रसजेदमुत्र॥<br />Reflect, Oking, the suicidal (effects of your) acts which are the reverse of the acts of honorable men and unproductive either of virtue or of wealth you have obtained blame, O king, in this world and again will you get misery in another.</p>
<p id='17'>राशंससे पुत्रवशानुगोऽस्या अधर्मशब्दश्च महान् पृथिव्यां नेदं कर्म त्वत्समं भारताग्रय॥<br />Now following the whims of your son, you expect to obtain the wealth which it is hard to gain; you want to enjoy without them to share it. This act has been loudly proclaimed to be vicious in this world and this act is not worthy of you, O you foremost of the race of Bharata.</p>
<p id='18'>हीनप्रज्ञो दौष्कुलेयो नृशंसो दीर्घ वैरी क्षत्रविद्यास्वधीरः। हीनवीर्यो यश्च भवेदशिष्टः॥<br />Those who are devoid of wisdom, who are born is low families, who are cruel, who cherish feelings of enmity for a long time and who are not steady in the acquisitions of a Kshatriya, who are devoid to heroism and who are vicious-those who answer this description are overtaken by ruin.</p>
<p id='19'>कुले जातो बलवान् यो यशस्वी बहुश्रुतः सुखजीवी यतात्मा। धर्माधर्मी ग्रथितौ यो बिभर्ति स ह्यस्य वशादुपैति॥<br />It is through luck that one is born in a high family, is mighty, is renowned, is vastly learned, is happy in this life, tries to subdue his soul or supports virtue and vice which have a close connection between them.</p>
<p id='20'>कथं हि मन्त्राग्रयधरो मनीषी धर्मार्थयोरापदि सम्प्रणेता। एवं युक्तः सर्वमन्त्रैरहीनो नरो नृशंसं कर्म कुर्यादमूढः॥<br />The Kurus will prematurely cease to exist, if through your sins, he who has created no enemies wishes you misery. He will transfer (effect of) his sins to you and you will be blamed in the world.</p>
<p id='21'>तव ह्यमी मन्त्रविदः समेत्य समासते कर्मसु नित्ययुक्ताः। तेषामयं बलवान् निश्चयश्च कुरुक्षये नियमेनोदपादि॥<br />Why should a man who is advised by the best of ministers, who is wise and who is master of actions producing virtue and interest in times of distress and who has not lost his senses why should such a man do a cruel deed like a man who is devoid of all advice.</p>
<p id='22'>अकालिकं कुरवो नाभविष्यन् पापेन चेत् पापमजातशत्रुः। इच्छेज्जातु त्वयि पापं विसृज्य निन्दा चेयं तव लोकेऽभविष्यत्॥<br />All these ministers of yours, ever devoted to work, wait together. It is through their firm determination (that they will not give back to the Pandavas their share of the kingdom) that the destruction of the Kurus will be accomplished.</p>
<p id='23'>किमन्यत्र विषयादीश्वराणां यत्र पार्थः परलोकं स्म दुष्टम्। न संशयो नास्ति मनुष्यकारः॥<br />What else is it but divine that the son of Pritha left this world to behold the other and was there honored like one having the privilege of roaming about both the worlds. This is not the doing of a man. There is no doubt about it.</p>
<p id='24'>एतान् गुणान् कर्मकृतानवेक्ष्य भावाभावौ वर्तमानावनित्यौ। बलिहि राजा पारमविन्दमानो नान्यत् कालात् कारणं तत्र मेने॥<br />Seeing that the growth of these attributes (viz., heroism etc.) depended on action and that wealth and poverty were transient, king Bali, in his search about the cause of this came to the conclusion that god and nothing else was the cause thereof.</p>
<p id='25'>चक्षुः श्रोत्रे नासिकात्वक् च जिह्वा ज्ञानस्यैतान्यायतनानि जन्तोः। तानि प्रीतान्येव तान्यव्यथो दुःखहीनः प्रणुद्यात्॥<br />The eye, the ear, the nose, the touch and the tongue, these are the sources of the knowledge of animals. These are gratified if thirst is destroyed; therefore should a man cheerfully bring these under control.</p>
<p id='26'>न त्वेव मन्ये पुरुषस्य कर्म संवर्तते सुप्रयुक्तं यथावत्। मातुः पितुः कर्मणाभिप्रसूत: संवर्धते विधिवद् भोजनेन॥<br />Others put it in a different way. (They say) that the desired effect must come out of one's acts when done properly. (Thus) the child is the outcome of the act of its father and mother and it grows by proper diet.</p>
<p id='27'>प्रियाप्रिये सुखदुःखे च राजन् निन्दाप्रशंसे च भजन्त एव। परस्त्वेनं गर्हयतेऽपराधे प्रशंसते साधुवृत्तं तमेव॥ तृष्णाक्षयान्ते<br />O king, man is subject to good and bad, happiness and misery, praise and censure. He wins praise when he does any good act and blame when he commits any wrong.</p>
<p id='28'>दन्तो नूनं भवितायं प्रजानाम्। नो चेदिदं तव कर्मापराधात् कुरून् देहत् कृष्णवर्मेव कक्षम्॥<br />I blame you; for, the result of this struggle between the sons of Bharata will surely be the destruction of innumerable human lives and if peace be not concluded the Kurus will be consumed by Arjuna like a heap of dried grass by a blazing fire through your fault.</p>
<p id='29'>त्वमेवैको जातु पुत्रस्य राजन् वशं गत्वा सर्वलोके नरेन्द्र। कामात्मनः श्लाघनो द्युतकाले नागाः शमं पश्य विपाकमस्य॥<br />O Lord of men, you, alone of all the world having come under the influence of your headstrong son, regarded success as sure and did not prevent the dispute at the time of the game; now, see the result of this.</p>
<p id='30'>अनाप्तानां संग्रहात् त्वं नगेन्द्र तथाऽऽप्तानां निग्रहाच्चैव राजन्। मशक्तस्त्वं रक्षितुं कौरवेय।॥<br />O king, O lord of men, you will not be able to return this broad domain on account of your weakness, in listening to the counsels of false ministers and rejecting that of faithful advisers, Oson of Kuru.</p>
<p id='31'>अनुज्ञातो स्थवेगावधूतः श्रान्तोऽभिपद्ये शयनं नृसिंह। मजातशत्रोर्वचनं समेताः॥<br />O best of men, being very much fatigued by the speedy motion of the car I solicit your permission to retire to rest; for in the morning the sons of Kuru assembled in the council chamber will listen to the message of him who has created no enemies.</p>
<p id='32'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच अनुज्ञातोऽस्यावसथं परेहि प्रपद्यस्व शयनं सूतपुत्र। मजातशत्रोर्वचनं त्वयोक्तम्॥<br />Dhritarashtra said O son of Suta, being permitted by me go you to your house and retire to rest. In the morning will the sons of Kuru in the council chamber be hearers of the message of him who has created no enemies, alluded to by you.</p>
