<h3>PANDAVA PRAVESHA PARVA: Chapter 12</h3><h4>The entry of Nakula</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच विराटराजं तरसा समेयिवान्। तमापतन्तं ददृशे पृथग्जनो विमुक्तमभ्रादिव सूर्यमण्डलम्॥<br />Vaishampayana said Then there was seen another mighty son of Pandu approaching king Virata in haste; the common people thereof saw him coming like solar orb freed from the clouds.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>स वै हयानैक्षत तांस्ततस्ततः समीक्षमाणं स ददर्श मत्स्यराट्। ततोऽब्रवीत् ताननुगान् नरेश्वरः कुतोऽयमायाति नरोऽमरोपमः॥<br />He began to observe the horses around; the king of the Matsya's, the lord of people, seeing him observing his horses minutely asked his followers "whence is this man lustrous like a celestials, coming"?</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>स्वयं हयानीक्षति मामकान् दृढं ध्रुवं हयज्ञो भविता विचक्षणः। प्रवेश्यतामेष समीपामाशु मे विभाति वीरो हि यथामरस्तथा॥<br />This person looks closely at my horses. Must he be proficient in horse-lore. Let him quickly enter into my presence. This heroic one seems to me as much as a celestials.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>ज्जयोऽस्तु ते पार्थिव भद्रमस्तु वः। हयेषु युक्तो नृप सम्मतः सदा तराश्वसूतो निपुणो भवाम्यहम्॥<br />That slaughterer of enemies, having approached the king addressed him thus "O king, let victory be to you and good betide you all. I am always esteemed by kings for my ability as a horse-painter. I will be an expert keeper of your horses.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>विराट उवाच ददामि यानानि धनं निवेशनं ममाश्वसूतो भवितुं त्वमर्हसि। कुतोऽसि कस्यासि कथं त्वमागतः प्रब्रूहि शिल्पं तव विद्यते च यत्॥<br />Virata said I give you vehicles, wealth and quarters; you deserve to be the keeper of my horses. But tell me whence you are come, whose you are, and how you came here, also tell me of the arts you are versed with.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>नकुल उवाच पञ्चानां पाण्डुपुत्राणां ज्येष्ठो भ्राता युधिष्ठिरः। तेनाहमश्वेषु पुरा नियुक्तः शत्रुकर्शन॥<br />Nakula said O repressor of foes, of the five sons of Pandu, Yudhishthira is the eldest brother, by him I was formerly employed as a keeper of his horses.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>अश्वानां प्रकृति वेद्मि विनयं चापि सर्वशः। दुष्टानां प्रतिपत्तिं च कृत्स्नं चैव चिकित्सितम्॥<br />I know the temper of horses, and the art of breaking them completely. I know how to correct the wicked steeds and the treatment of all kinds.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>न कातरं स्यान्मम जातु वाहनं न मेऽस्ति दुष्टा वडवा कुतो हयाः। जनस्तु मामाह स चापि पाण्डवो युधिष्ठिरो ग्रन्थिकमेव नामतः॥<br />Under my care hardly does any animal fall ill. What to speak of horses even mares in my hands are not to be found wicked. People called me by name, Granthika so also Yudhishthira the son of Pandu.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>विराट उवाच यदस्ति किंचिन्मम वाजिवाहनं तदस्तु सर्वं त्वदधीनमद्य वै। स्त्वदाश्रयाः सारथयश्च सन्तु मे॥<br />Virata said Let all my horses that belong to me be entrusted to your care from today. Let all my charioteers and those to yoke my horses, be henceforth subordinate to you.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>इदं तवेष्टं यदि वै सुरोपम ब्रवीहि यत् ते प्रसमीक्षितं वसु। न तेऽनुरूपं हयकर्म विद्यते प्रभासि राजेव हि सम्मतो मम॥<br />If this be your desire, O god-like one, tell me what remuneration is sought by you. This office of horse-training does not become you, because you look like a king and you are agreeable to me.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>युधिष्ठिरस्येव हि दर्शनेन मे समं तवेदं प्रियमत्र दर्शनम्। कथं तु भृत्यैः स विनाकृतो वने वसत्यनिन्द्यो रमते च पाण्डवः॥<br />Here, the very sight of you is as much pleasing to me as that of Yudhishthira himself. Oh how does that faultless son of Pandu, dwell and divert himself in the forest without his servants.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच तथा स गन्धर्ववरोपमो युवा विराटराज्ञा मुदितेन पूजितः। न चैनमन्येऽपि विदुः कथंचन प्रियाभिरामं विचरन्तमन्तरा॥<br />Vaishampayana said That youthful one resembling the chief of the Gandharvas was thus honoured by the delighted king of Virata, and no one recognized him conducting himself agreeably in the city.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>एवं हि मत्स्ये न्यवसन्त पाण्डवा यथाप्रतिज्ञाभिरमोघदर्शनाः। अज्ञातचर्यां व्यचरन् समाहिताः समुद्रनेमीपतयोऽतिदुःखिताः॥<br />Thus the son of Pandu, whose very sight never proved abortive, began to live in the kingdom of Matsya; and in conformity with their pledge, the lords of the earth surrounded by seas although stricken with woe began to pass their days of non-discovery with composure.</p>
