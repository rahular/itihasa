<h3>SANAT-SUJATA PARVA: Chapter 41</h3><h4>The parley between Vidura and Dhritarashtra</h4><p id='1'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच अनुक्तं यदि ते किंचिद् वाचा विदुर विद्यते। तन्मे शुश्रूषतो ब्रूहि विचित्राणि हि भाषसे।॥<br />Dhritarashtra said If there is anything you have left unsaid, O Vidura, speak to me who am listening to you. You are speaking of interesting things.</p>
<p id='2'>विदुर उवाच धृतराष्ट्र कुमारो वै यः पुराणः सनातनः। सनत्सुजातः प्रोवाच मृत्यु स्तीति भारत॥<br />Vidura said O Dhritarashtra, the ancient and eternal Rishi Sanat-Sujata, who lived a life of perpetual celibacy, said that there was no death, O Bharata.</p>
<p id='3'>स ते गुह्यान् प्रकाशांश्च सर्वान् हृदयसंश्रयान्। प्रवक्ष्यति महाराज सर्वबुद्धिमतां वरः॥<br />That chief among intelligent beings will speak to you. O great king, on the subjects thought of by you, whether you have made them known or kept them locked up in your heart.</p>
<p id='4'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच किं त्वं न वेद तद् भूयो ब्रूयात् सनातनः। त्वमेव विदुर ब्रूहि प्रज्ञाशेषोऽस्ति चेत् तव॥<br />Dhritarashtra said Do you not know what that internal being will say to me? You, O Vidura, speak (about these things) if your mind has that limit of wisdom.</p>
<p id='5'>विदुर उवाच शूद्रयोनावहं जातो नातोऽन्यद् वक्तुमुत्सहे। कुमारस्य तु या बुद्धिर्वेद तां शाश्वतीमहम्॥<br />Vidura said I am born among the Shudra class; for that reason, I do not dare say anything more (than what I have already said); the knowledge of that celebrate being, however, is considered by me as eternal.</p>
<p id='6'>ब्राह्मी हि योनिमापन्नः सुगुह्यमपि यो वदेत्। न तेन गह्यो देवानां तस्मादेतद् ब्रवीमि ते॥<br />He, born is the Brahmana class, even when speaking of highly mysterious affairs, will not incur the blame of the gods; therefore I am speaking thus to you.</p>
<p id='7'>धृतराष्ट्र उवा ब्रवीहि विदुर त्वं मे पुराणं तं सनातनम्। कथमेतेन देहेन स्यादिहैव समागमः॥<br />Dhritarashtra said Tell me, O Vidura, how I can with this body of mine meet with that ancient and eternal being in this world.</p>
<p id='8'>वैशम्पायन उवाच चिन्तयामास विदुरस्तमृषि शंसितव्रतम्। स च तच्चिन्तितं ज्ञात्वां दर्शयामास भारत॥<br />Vaishampayana said Then did Vidura think of that Rishi of rigid austerities; he, too, becoming aware of that thought showed himself then, O Bharata.</p>
<p id='9'>स चैनं प्रतिजग्राह विधिदृष्टेन कर्मणा। सुखोपविष्टं विश्रान्तमथैनं विदुरोऽब्रवीत्॥<br />Vidura, too, received him by the rites prescribed by custom; and Vidura addressed him when he (the latter) was seated at his ease and taking rest.</p>
<p id='10'>भगवन् संशयः कश्चिद् धृतराष्ट्रस्य मानसः। यो न शक्यो मया वक्तुं त्वमस्मै वक्तुमर्हसि॥<br />O Lord, there is certainly a doubt in the mind of Dhritarashtra, which cannot be removed by me; therefore it is fitting that you should speak to him (and remove the doubt).</p>
<p id='11'>यं श्रुत्वायं मनुष्येन्द्रः सर्वदुःखातिगो भवेत्। लाभालाभौ प्रियद्वेष्यौ यथैनं न जरान्तकौ॥ विषहेरन् भयामर्षी क्षुत्पिपासे मदोद्भवौ। अरतिश्चैव तन्द्री च कामक्रोधौ क्षयोदयौ॥<br />Hearing which (your speech) this chief among men will be past all misery; so that gain and the reverse of gain, what is agreeable and disagreeable, old age and death, fear and jealously, hunger and thirst, pride and prosperity, disinclination for women, sleep, desire, anger, loss and gain may be borne by him (with ease).</p>
