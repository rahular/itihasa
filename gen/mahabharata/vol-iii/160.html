<h3>BHAGAVAD-YANA PARVA: Chapter 90</h3><h4>The conversation between Kunti and Krishna</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच अथोपगम्य विदुरमपराह्ने जनार्दनः। पितृष्वसारं स पृथामभ्यगच्छदरिंदमः॥<br />Vaishampayana said After his visit to Vidura, Janardana, the subduer of enemies, went in the afternoon to Pritha, his mother's sister.</p>
<p id='2'>सा दृष्ट्वा कृष्णमायान्तं प्रसन्नादित्यवर्चसम्। कण्ठे गृहीत्वा प्राक्रोशत् स्मरन्ती तनयान् पृथा॥<br />Seeing Krishna approaching and effulgent like the radiant sun, Pritha clasped his neck with her arms and poured forth her loud lamentations, remembering her sons.</p>
<p id='3'>तेषां सत्त्ववतां मध्ये गोविन्दं सहचारिणम्। चिरस्य दृष्ट्वा वार्ष्णेयं बाष्पमाहारयत् पृथा॥<br />Seeing Govinda after a long time, the action of the Vrishni race, companion of her sons, endued with prowess, Pritha shed tears.</p>
<p id='4'>साब्रवीत् कृष्णमासीनं कृतातिथ्यं युधां पतिम्। बाष्पगद्गदपूर्णेन मुखेन परिशुष्यता॥<br />She said to Krishna, the best of warriors who had seated himself after receiving the rites of hospitality, with her face dried up with woe and in a voice choked up with tears.</p>
<p id='5'>ये ते बाल्यात् प्रभृत्येव गुरुशुश्रूषणे रताः। परस्परस्य सुहृदः सम्मताः समचेतसः। निकृत्या भ्रंशिता राज्याज्जनार्हा निर्जनं गताः॥<br />'Those, who ever since their childhood are attached to the service of their elders, those who are endued with humility and those who are of similar hearts, were deprived of their kingdom by deceit and sent into exile, through they were desirous of remaining in the society of men.</p>
<p id='6'>विनीतक्रोधहर्षाश्च ब्रह्मण्याः सत्यवादिनः। त्यक्त्वा प्रियसुखे पार्था रुदतीमपहाय माम्॥<br />They, who have brought under control wrath and joy, who are devoted to the Brahmanas, who are speakers of truth, those sons of mine abandoning their dear enjoyments and leaving behind them myself weeping for them.</p>
<p id='7'>अहापुंश्च वनं यान्तः समूलं हृदयं मम। अतदर्हा महात्मानः कथं केशवं पाण्डवाः॥<br />Have gone to the forest, rendering the very bottom of my heart. These large-souled sons of Pandu undeserving of these miserieshow did they, O Keshava.</p>
<p id='8'>ऊषुर्महावने तात सिंहव्याघ्रगजाकुले। बाला विहीनाः पित्रा ते मया सततलालिताः॥<br />Live in that great forest, O child, abandoning, as it was, in lions, tigers and elephants. Losing their father in their boyhood, they were even reared and brought up by myself.</p>
<p id='9'>अपश्यन्तश्च पितरौ कथमूषुर्महावने। शङ्खदुन्दुभिनिर्घोषैर्मृदङ्गैर्वेणुनिःस्वनैः॥<br />Without seeing their parents, how did they live in the great forest? By the sounds of conches and drums and the music of flutes.</p>
<p id='10'>पाण्डवाः समबोध्यन्त बाल्यात् प्रभृति केशव। ये स्म वारणशब्देन हयानां हेषितेन च॥ रथनेमिनिनादैश्च व्यबोध्यन्त तदा गृहे। शङ्खभेरीनिनादेन वेणुवीणानुनादिना॥ पुण्याहघोषमिश्रेण पूज्यमाना द्विजातिभिः। वस्त्रै रत्नैरलंकारैः पूजयन्तो द्विजन्मनः॥ गीर्भिर्मङ्गलयुक्ताभिर्ब्राह्मणानां महात्मनाम्। अर्चितैरर्चनाहश्च स्तुवद्भिरभिनन्दिताः॥ प्रासादाचेष्वबोध्यन्त राङ्कवाजिनशायिनः। क्रूरं च निनदं श्रुत्वा श्वापदानां महावने॥<br />Were the Pandavas awakened from their sleep ever since their infancy, O Keshava; who again, were by the roar of elephants and neighing of horses and by the rattles of the wheels of the chariots awakened from sleep at home-also by the sound of conches and cymbals accompanied with the music of flutes and lyres; and whose praises were sung by the twice-born at the break of day in high sounding songs; and who worshipped the deserving Brahmanas with the raiment's, gems and jewels; who, worthy of respect, themselves were blessed and done homage to by the largesouled Brahmanas by laudatory hymns and worshipped as well. How could they, lying on soft blankets and skin of the Ranku deer in the best parts of the palace, be awakened by hearing the loud roar of animals in the great forest?</p>
<p id='11'>न स्मोपयान्ति निद्रां ते न तदर्हा जनार्दन। भेरीमृदङ्गनिनदैः शङ्खवैणवनिस्वनैः॥ स्त्रीणां गीतनिनादैश्च मधुरैर्मधुसूदन्। वन्दिमागधसूतैश्च स्तुवद्भिबौधिताः कथम्॥<br />It does not seem possible to me that they obtained sleep, though they did not at all deserve this, O Janardana, those who by the sound of cymbals and drums and the conches and flutes and by the sweet music of songs by woman, O slayer of Madhu, were awakened and praised by the prisoners and professional bards-how could they.</p>
<p id='12'>महावनेष्वबोध्यन्त श्वापदानां रुतेन च। ह्रीमान् सत्यधृतिर्दान्तो भूतानामनुकम्पिता॥ कामद्वेषो वशे कृत्वा सतां वानुवर्तते। अम्बरीषस्य मान्धातुर्ययातेर्नहुषस्य च॥ भरतस्य दिलीपस्य शिबेरौशीनरस्य च। राजर्षीणां पुराणानां धुरं धत्ते दुरुद्वहाम्॥ शीलवृत्तोपसम्पन्नो धर्मज्ञः सत्यसंगरः। राजा सर्वगुणोपेतस्त्रैलोक्यस्यापि यो भवेत्॥ अजातशत्रुर्धर्मात्मा शुद्धजाम्बूनदप्रभः। श्रेष्ठः कुरुषु सर्वेषु धर्मतः श्रुतवृत्ततः। प्रियदशों दीर्घभुजः कथं कृष्ण युधिष्ठिरः॥<br />In the great forest be awakened at the roar of animals?

<p id='24'>महाजिनसम्पन्ना सर्वकामैः सुपूजिता। ईश्वरी सर्वकल्याणी द्रौपदी कथमच्युत॥<br />O Achyuta, how is the all blessed queen Draupadi of illustrious birth well gratified with the fulfillment of all her desires?</p>

<p id='27'>न नूनं कर्मभिः पुण्यैरश्नुते पुरुषः सुखम्। द्रौपदी चेत् तथावृत्ता नाश्नुते सुखमव्ययम्॥<br />It seems that a man does not surely get happiness as the result of his virtuous acts; for Draupadi, though of virtuous habits of life, does not get unending happiness.</p>

<p id='30'>आनायितामनार्येण क्रोधलोभानुवर्तिना। सर्वे प्रेक्षन्त कुरव एकवस्त्रा सभागताम्॥<br />She dragged there by that dishonourable wretch, from motives of wrath and covetousness, and all the Kurus gazed on her brought to the Assembly-Hall in a single raiment.</p>
<p id='31'>तत्रैव धृतराष्ट्रश्च महाराजश्च बाह्निकः। कृपश्च सोमदत्तश्च निर्विण्णाः कुरवस्तथा॥<br />There were at the time Dhritarashtra, the great king Balhika, Kripa, Somadatta and the Kurus who were pained at it.</p>
<p id='32'>तस्यां संसदि सर्वेषां क्षत्तारं पूजयाम्यहम्। वृत्तेन हि भवत्यार्यो न धनेन न विद्यया॥<br />Of all the people present in that assembly I honour that Kshatta (Vidura) most; for a man becomes honourable by his habits and not by his wealth, nor by his knowledge.</p>

<p id='36'>तन्मां दहति यत् कृष्णा सभायां कुरुसंनिधौ। धाष्ट्रैिः परिक्लिष्टा यथा न कुशलं तथा॥<br />The degree, to which this fact pains me, namely the dragging of Krishna to the Assembly-Hall in the presence of the Kurus and insulted by the sons of Dhritarashtra, is not equalled by death itself.</p>
<p id='37'>निर्वासनं च नगरात् प्रव्रज्या च परंतप। नानाविधानां दुःखानामभिज्ञास्मि जनार्दन॥<br />O chastiser of foes, the exile (of my sons) out of city and their wanderings and several other grief's have l experienced, O Janardana.</p>
<p id='38'>अज्ञातचर्या बालानामवरोधश्च माधवा न मे क्लेशतमं तत् स्यात् पुत्रैः सह परंतप॥<br />O Madhava, O chastiser of foes, living in concealment and the deprivation of my boys, could not be so painful to me in the company of my sons?</p>
<p id='39'>दुर्योधनेन निकृता वर्षमद्य चतुर्दशम्। दुःखादपि सुखं नः स्याद् यदि पुण्यफलक्षयः॥<br />It is fourteen years now since they were exiled by Duryodhana; and happiness should be ours, if misery puts an end to the fruits of vice.</p>
<p id='40'>न मे विषेषो जात्वासीत् धार्तराष्ट्रेषु पाण्डवैः तेन सत्येन कृष्ण त्वां हतामित्रं श्रिया वृतम्। अस्माद् विमुक्तं संग्रामात् पश्येयं पाण्डवैः सह॥६शा<br />I never treated the sons of Dhritarashtra in a different way from that in which I treated the sons of Pandu; and by virtue of this truth shall I see, O Krishna, yourself along with the Pandavas after you have slain your enemies invested with prosperity, come out safe from this impending war.</p>
<p id='41'>नैव शक्याः पराजेतुं सर्वं ह्येषां तथाविधम्। पितरं त्वेव गर्हेयं नात्मानं न सुयोधनम्॥<br />All of them having such like qualities are incapable of being defeated by the enemies. But my father is to blame ((for all this grief) and not myself, nor Suyodhana.</p>
<p id='42'>येनाहं कुन्तिभोजाय धनं वृत्तैरिवार्पिता। बालां मामार्यकस्तुभ्यं क्रीडन्ती कन्दुहस्तिकाम्॥<br />By him I was given away to Kuntibhoja like wealth given away by a rich man. While yet a girl playing with a ball in my hand, your grand-father.</p>
<p id='43'>अदात् तु कुन्तिभोजाय सखा सख्ये महात्मने। साऽहं पित्रा च निकृता श्वशुरैश्च परंतप। अत्यन्तदुःखिता कृष्ण किं जीवितफलं मम॥<br />Gave me away to his friend, the largesouled Kuntibhoja; such a one was myself and abandoned by my father and my father-in-law. O chastiser of foes, meeting with great troubles, O Krishna, what is the use of my life?</p>

<p id='45'>हत्वा कुरून् महाजन्ये राज्यं प्राप्य धनंजयः। भ्रातृभिः सह कौन्तेयस्त्रीन् मेधानाहरिष्यति॥<br />Slaughtering the Kurus in a great battle and obtaining the kingdom, Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, along with his brothers, will perform three grand sacrificial rites.'</p>
<p id='46'>नाहं तामभ्यसूयामि नमो धर्माय वेधसे। कृष्णाय महते नित्यं धर्मो धारयति प्रजाः॥<br />I do not doubt the eventual justification of that foreboding. I bow to Dharma and to the creator and to Krishna who is ever great. Creatures are supported by Dharma (Virtue).</p>
<p id='47'>धर्मश्चेदस्ति वार्ष्णेय यथा वागभ्यभाषता त्वं चापि तत् तथा कृष्ण सर्वं सम्पादयिष्यसि॥<br />If Dharma (Virtue) exists in this world, O scion of the Vrishni race, thus you too will be what the voice announced, O Krishna; and you will accomplish all that.</p>
<p id='48'>न मां माधव वैधव्यं नार्थनाशो न वैरता। तथा शोकाय दहति यथा पुत्रैर्विनाभवः॥<br />O Madhava, neither widowhood, nor the loss of wealth, nor even this dispute has pained me so much as my separation from my sons.</p>

<p id='50'>इतश्चतुर्दशं वर्ष यन्नापश्यं युधिष्ठिरम्। धनंजयं च गोविन्द यमौ तं च वृकोदरम्॥<br />Nor have I seen Dhananjaya, O Govinda, the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva and also that Vrikodara; people perform the Shradha (obsequies) of absent people under the impression that they are dead.</p>
<p id='51'>जीवनाशं प्रनष्टानां श्राद्धं कुर्वन्ति मानवाः। अर्थतस्ते मम मृतास्तेषां चाहं जनार्दन॥<br />Virtually they are dead to me and I am the same to them, O Janardana, O Madhava, say this to the virtuous-souled king Yudhishthira.</p>
<p id='52'>ब्रूया माधव राजानं धर्मात्मानं युधिष्ठिरम्। भूयास्ते हीयते धर्मो मा पुत्रक वृथा कृथाः॥<br />Your virtue is becoming less and less o son; act in such a way that this may not be; fie to them, O Vasudeva, that live under the protection of others.</p>
<p id='53'>पराश्रया वासुदेव या जीवति धिगस्तु ताम्। वृत्तेः कार्पण्यलध्याया अप्रतिष्ठेव ज्यायसी॥<br />To a mode of life attended with meanness death even is superior. Say also to Dhananjaya and Vrikodara who are constantly on the alert.</p>
<p id='54'>अथो धनंजयं ब्रूया नित्योद्युक्तं वृकोदरम्। यदर्थं क्षत्रिया सूते तस्य कालोऽयमागतः॥<br />This is the time come for the purpose, for which a Kshatriya woman brings forth a son, if you let the occasion, which is now come, slip without doing anything;</p>
<p id='55'>अस्मिश्चेदागते काले मिथ्या चातिक्रमिष्यति। लोकसम्भाविता: सन्तः सुनृशंसं करिष्यथ॥<br />You will be doing what is cruel and mean, though you are respected by the world; and if you are ever contemptible, I shall abandon and disown you forever.</p>
<p id='56'>नृशंसेन च वो युक्तांस्त्यजेयं शाश्वतीः समाः। काले हि समनुप्राप्ते त्यक्तव्यमपि जीवनम्॥<br />When the suitable moment arrives, life even should be laid down. The two sons of Madri who are ever attached to virtuous deeds should be spoken to.</p>
<p id='57'>पाद्रीपुत्रौ च वक्तव्यौ क्षत्रधर्मरतौ सदा। विक्रमेणार्जितान् भोगान् वृणीतं जीवितादपि॥<br />Chose these comforts and luxuries, which are attainable by a display of your prowess, rather than even life itself, since objects attained by prowess alone are ever pleasing to those who live the life of Kshatriyas.</p>
<p id='58'>विक्रमाधिगता हार्थाः क्षत्रधर्मेण जीवतः। मनो मनुष्यस्य सदा प्रीणन्ति पुरुषोत्तमः॥<br />And ever gladden the hearts of men, O you best among men. Having gone there speak to him who is the foremost among all wielders of weapons,</p>

<p id='60'>विदितौ हि तवात्यन्तं क्रुद्धौ तौ तु यथान्तकौ। भीमार्जुनौ नयेतां हि देवानपि परां गतिम्॥<br />And (when such is the case) Bhima and Arjuna can bring the very gods to the end of their life. This insult, namely that Krishna was dragged to the Assembly-Hall was offered to them;</p>
<p id='61'>तयोश्चैतदवज्ञानं यत् सा कृष्णा सभां गता। दुःशासनश्च कर्णश्च परुषाण्यभ्यभाषताम्॥<br />And Dushasana and Karna spoke harsh and insulting words. Duryodhana has insulted the spirited Bhimasena.</p>
<p id='62'>दुर्योधनो भीमसेनमभ्यगच्छन्मनस्विनम्। पश्यतां कुरुमुख्यानां तस्य द्रक्ष्यति यत् फलम्॥<br />In the presence of the chiefs among the Kurus he will see what the consequences of that will be. Vrikodara having once been made an enemy cannot make peace.</p>
<p id='63'>न हि वैरं समासाद्य प्रशाम्यति वृकोदरः। सुचिरादपि भीमस्य न हि वैरं प्रशाम्यति। यावदन्तं न नयति शात्रवाञ्छत्रुकर्शनः॥<br />The feelings of revenge in Bhima too will not calm down in a short time until that grinder of enemies does make an end of them.</p>
<p id='64'>न दुःखं राज्यहरणं न च द्यूते पराजयः। प्रव्राजनं तु पुत्राणां न मे तद् दुःखकारणम्॥<br />The loss of kingdom is not a source of trouble, not even the defeat at the game of dice; nor even the exile of my sons was so much the cause of my affliction;</p>

<p id='66'>स्त्रीधर्मिणी वरारोहा क्षत्रधर्मरता सदा। नाभ्यगच्छत् तदा नाथं कृष्णा नाथवती सती॥<br />Krishna, though her husbands were living, was at that time without the protection of a lord-that lady of beautiful hips with the modesty proper to a lay and ever attached to the virtue of a Kshatriya princess.</p>
