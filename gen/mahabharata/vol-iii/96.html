<h3>SANJAYAYANA PARVA: Chapter 24</h3><h4>The speech of Sanjaya</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>संजय उवाच यथाऽऽत्य मे पाण्डव तत् तथैव कुरून् कुरुश्रेष्ठ जनं च पृच्छसि। अनामयास्तात मनस्विनस्ते कुरुश्रेष्ठान् पृच्छसि पार्थ यांस्त्वम्॥<br />Sanjaya said It is exactly as you, say O son of Pandu. You enquire, dear sir, about the Kurus and the foremost among them. Those whom you enquire about, O soil of Pritha, viz., the foremost among the race of Kuru, those wise ones are doing well.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>सन्त्येव वृद्धाः साधवो धार्तराष्ट्र सन्त्येव पापाः पाण्डव तस्य विद्धि। दद्याद् रिपुभ्योऽपि हि धार्तराष्ट्रः कुतो दायाँल्लोपयेद् ब्राह्मणानाम्॥<br />Know them that the son of Dhritarashtra is surrounded by aged men and true and also by wicked men, O son of Pandu. To the enemy even would the son of Dhritarashtra give away, why then should he discontinue what is due to the Brahmanas?</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>मगुग्धेषु दुग्धवत् तन्न साधु। मित्रध्रुक स्याद् धृतराष्ट्रः सपुत्रो युष्मान् द्विषन् साधुवृत्तानसाधुः॥<br />The rule that obtains among among you (Kshatriyas) viz., to harm those that do not injure you is rule for butchers. It is not good, if Dhritarashtra, with his sons like a bad man, speaks ill of you who follow good practices, they would be guilty of conspiring against friends.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>न चानुजानाति भृशं च तप्यते शोचत्यन्तः स्थविरोऽजातशत्रो। शृणोति हि ब्राह्मणानां समेत्य मित्रद्रोहः पातकेभ्यो गरीयान्॥<br />He dose not approve of it (the injury done to you); he is very sorry for it and the old man on his part repents for it. ( you who have created no enemies, having consulted the Brahmanas he has come to know that conspiring against friends is the worst of all sins.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>स्मरन्ति तुभ्यं नरदेव संयुगे युद्धे च जिष्णोश्च युधां प्रणेतुः। समुत्कृष्टे दुन्दुभिशङ्खशब्दे गदापाणिं भीमसेनं स्मरन्ति॥<br />They remember, O god among men, your might in battle and remember also the one who always gets victories and is the leader in battles (Arjuna). They remember Bhimasena with the mace in his hand when there is sound of conch shells and drums.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>माद्रीसुतौ चापि रणाजिमध्ये सर्वा दिशः सम्पतन्तौ स्मरन्ति। सेनां वर्षन्तौ शरवरजस्त्रं महारथौ समरे दुष्प्रकम्पौ॥<br />They remember too the two mighty sons of the king of Madri who, in battle, fell (the enemies) in all directions showering on the (hostile) army continuous flight of arrows and whom it is hard to cause to tremble in battle.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>ननागतं ज्ञायते यद् भविष्यम्। त्वं चेत् तथा सर्वधर्मोपपन्नः प्राप्तः क्लेशं पाण्डव कृच्छ्ररूपम्। त्वमेवैतत् कृच्छ्रगतश्च भूयः समीकुर्याः प्रज्ञयाऽजातशत्रो॥<br />I think that we cannot know what is yet to befall a man, what futurity has in store for him. For this reason have you, O son of Pandu, though endued with all the virtuous, met with very hard troubles. You will no by means of your wisdom, make up for all these, O you who have created no enemies.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>न कामार्थं संत्यजेयुर्हि धर्म पाण्डोः सुताः सर्व एवेन्द्रकल्पाः। त्वमेवैतत् प्रज्ञयाऽजातशत्रो समीकुर्या येन शर्माप्नुयुस्ते॥ धार्तराष्ट्राः पाण्डवा संजयाश्च ये चाप्यन्ये संनिविष्टा नरेन्द्राः।<br />The sons of Pandu all equal to Indra, will not leave virtue for the sake of pleasure. You will, O you who have created no enemies, so make it up with your wisdom so that all will obtain peace-the sons of Dhritarashtra the sons of Pandu, the Srinjayas and all the other king who have assembled here.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>मजातशत्रो वचनं पिता ते॥ सहामात्यः सहपुत्रश्च राजन् समेत्य तां वाचमिमां निबोध॥<br />Listen to what Dhritarashtra, who is equal to your father, has said, O you who have created no enemies, in consultation with his ministers and sons. O king attend to these words.</p>
