Having resided in the forest and met with troubles, they who are inclined to do good to others without deceit and honest still entertain friendly feeling towards us.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>नाहं क्वचित् संजय पाण्डवानां मिथ्यावृत्ति काञ्चन जात्वपश्यम्। सर्वां श्रियं ह्यात्मवीर्येण लब्धां पर्याकार्षुः पाण्डवा मह्यमेव॥<br />Never did I, O Sanjaya, observe any falsehood in the sons of Pandu. Having gained all their wealth through sheer strength of their own, have they made over the same to me.</p>

Though I was always on the look-out, yet never did I find anything done by these sons of Pritha for which we could blame them.

The boy thinks too that he is capable of robbing the living son of Pandu, of their share.</p>
