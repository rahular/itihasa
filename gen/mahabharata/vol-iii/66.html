The continuous sound made by his Gandiva bow with arrow shots, frightened the Kauravas' warriors.</p>

<p id='12'>तथा विसंज्ञेषु च तेषु पार्थः स्मृत्वा च वाक्यानि तथोत्तरायाः। मुवाच यावत् कुरवो विसंज्ञाः॥ आचार्यशारद्वतयोः सुशुक्ले कर्णस्य पीतं रुचिरं च वस्त्रम्। द्रौणेश्च राज्ञश्च तथैव नीले वस्त्रे समादत्स्व नरप्रवीर॥<br />Just when those warriors were fainted, the facts told by Uttara came to Arjuna's mind and he instructed Uttara, the son of Matsya king to slip carefully out from that place before they could regain conscious.

He seemed valorous like Indra, the king of gods. Having seen him alone, Duryodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra enquired immediately.</p>
<p id='19'>स्तथा प्रमनीत यथा न मुच्येत्। तमब्रवीच्छान्तनवः प्रहस्य क्व ते गता बुद्धिरभूत् क्व वीर्यम्॥ रुत्सृज्य बाणांश्च धनुर्विचित्रम्॥<br />"O Grandfather! How had he escaped from your hands? Churn him so badly as he could not escape." Bhishma, the son of Shantanu toughed and replied Duryodhana "O king! Where had your wit gone when you fell down unconscious here and your bow and arrows left aside? Tell me that where was your valour at that time?</p>
<p id='20'>त्वेष बीभत्सुरलं नृशंसं कर्तुं न पापेऽस्य मनो विशिष्टिम्॥ त्रैलोक्यहेतोर्न जहेत् स्वधर्म सर्वे न तस्मानिहता रणेऽस्मिन्। क्षिप्रं कुरून् याहि कुरुप्रवीर विजित्य गाश्च प्रतियातु पार्थः। मा ते स्वकोऽर्थो निपतेत मोहात् तत् संविदातव्यमरिष्टबन्धम्॥<br />Arjuna cannot behave cruelly as his mind never entangles in coming vice. He cannot abandon his religion even if enticed for ruling on trio-worlds. This is the reason, he did not killed us at that unconscious state. O one of pioneer warriors in Kuru race, go back to Kuru state immediately. Let Arjuna return to his destination with cows. Keep in mind your own interest and don't become cause for defeat of your own purpose. All of us should do whatever may ensure our welfare.</p>
<p id='21'>वैशम्पायन उवाच दुर्योधनस्तस्य तु तन्निशम्य पितामहस्यात्महितं वचोऽथ। अतीतकामो युधि सोऽत्यमर्षी राजा विनिःश्वस्य बभूव तूष्णीम्॥<br />Vaishampayana said-O Janamejaya! King Duryodhana gave up an idea to continue fight any more following the advice of grand-father in his interest. He kept mum in the matter sobbing deep with in heart for the humiliation suffered.</p>
<p id='22'>तद् भीष्मवाक्यं हितमीक्ष्य सर्वे धनंजयाग्निं च विवर्धमानम्। दुर्योधनं ते परिरक्षमाणाः॥<br />All other warriors affirmed the advice of Bhishma as they guessed of eruption of fire more and more in the form of Arjuna. Finally, they arrived at a conclusion to go back at their state with duly defending Duryodhana.</p>
<p id='23'>तान् प्रस्थितान् प्रीतमनाः स पार्थो धनंजयः प्रेक्ष्य कुरुप्रवीरान्। अभाषमाणोऽनुनयं मुहूर्त वचोब्रवीत् सम्परिहत्य भूयः॥<br />Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti filled with joy within heart when he saw Kaurava's army moving from there. He kept mum for more than half an hour without saying anything in request and submission.</p>
<p id='24'>पितामहं शान्तनवं च वृद्धं द्रोणं गुरुं च प्रणिपत्य मू । ज्छरैर्विचित्रैरभिवाद्य चैव॥ दुर्योधनस्योत्तमरत्नचित्रं चिच्छेद पार्थो मुकुटं शरेण।<br />He then saluted with his head bowed on the feet of grand-father Bhishma and preceptor Drona and talked on certain matters for a while. He then saluted through application of arrows varied ways to Ashvatthama, Kripacharya and other respected Kauravas (Banahika, Somadatta etc.) and cut the excellent gem-studded crown off from Duryodhana's head through an arrow.</p>
<p id='25'>आमन्त्र्य वीरांश्च तथैव मान्यान्। गाण्डीवघोषेण विनाद्य लोकान्॥ स देवदत्तं सहसा विनाद्य विदार्य वीरो द्विषतां मनांसि।<br />He similarly, bid farewell with other respected warriors, spreaded echo on stretch to his bow through out the world and threatened the enemies when he blew his conch Devadatta.</p>
<p id='26'>ध्वजेन सर्वानभिभूय शत्रून् सहेममालेन विराजमानः॥ दृष्ट्वा प्रयातांस्तु कुरून् किरीटी हृष्टोऽब्रवीत् तत्र स मत्स्यपुत्रम्। आवर्तयाश्वान् पशवो जितास्ते याताः परे याहि पुरं प्रहृष्टः॥<br />Thus Arjuna attained special grace with ecstacy of victory on all enemies. The flag trimmed with garland of gold duly erected on his chariot seemed as if humiliating his all enemies. Arjuna with a crown on head; exhilarated observing return of Kauravas from there. He said Uttara, the son of Matsya's king-"O Prince! Turn your horses back now. Your cows are won and enemies have departed. Hence, move now towards city with pleasure.</p>
<p id='27'>देवास्तु दृष्ट्वा महदद्भुतं तद् युद्धं कुरूणां सह फाल्गुनेन। जग्मुर्यथास्वं भवनं प्रतीताः पार्थस्य कर्माणि विचिन्तयन्तः॥<br />The gods enjoyed with ecstacy the fight between Arjuna and Kaurava and returned to their respective palaces with Arjuna's valour on their lips.</p>
