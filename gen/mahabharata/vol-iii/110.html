He gets it back after rising up and according him a suitable welcome.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>पीठं दत्त्वा साधवेऽभ्यागताय आनीयाप: परिनिर्णिज्य पादौ। सुखं पृष्ट्वा प्रतिवेद्यात्मसंस्थां ततो दद्यादन्नमवेक्ष्य धीरः॥<br />A wise man should give good guest a seat, bring water and have his feet washed off. And he should ask him about his welfare and speak of his own matters; then again, he should offer him food after consideration (as to what food is best suitable.)</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>यस्योदकं मधुपर्कं च गां च न मन्त्रवित् प्रतिगृह्णाति गेहे। लोभाद् भयादथ कार्पण्यतो वा तस्यानर्थं जीवितमाहुरायः॥<br />He, whose water, honey, curds and kine, one versed in the Mantras (Brahmana) does not accept either owing to fear (on the part of the Brahmana) or to unwillingness and miserliness (on the part of the host), lives in vain; which the wise have declared.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>चिकित्सकः शल्यकर्तावकीर्णी स्तनः क्रूरो मद्यपो भ्रूणहा च। सेनाजीवी श्रुतिविक्रायक्श्च भृशं प्रियोऽप्यतिथि!दकाहः। :॥<br />A physician, a manufacturer of arrows, one who has given up the of Brahmacharya before the proper time, a thief, a crooked-minded man, a drunkard Brahmana, one who kills the child in the womb, one who lives by serving in the army and a seller of holy books are exceedingly dear as guests, through they may be unworthy of the offer of water.</p>

<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>नीवारमूलेदशाकवृत्तिः सुसंयतात्माग्निकार्येषु चोद्यः। वने वसन्नतिथिष्वप्रमत्तो धुरन्धरः पुण्यकृदेष तापसः॥<br />The ascetic, who lives on rice growing wild and roots and vegetables, who has his soul under control, who is ever careful if his fire (that it may not be extinguished), who living in the forest is not indifferent to his guests, is considered to be holy and the foremost of his brotherhood.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>अपकृत्य बुद्धिमतो दूरस्थोऽस्मीति नाश्वसेत्। दीर्थी बुद्धिमतोबाहू याभ्यां हिंसति हिंसितः॥<br />After doing harm to an intelligent man, one should not console himself by saying that he is at a distance. The intelligent man who has been injured has long arms to return the injury.</p>

<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>पूजनीया महाभागाः पुण्याश्च गृहदीप्तयः। स्त्रियः श्रियो गृहस्योक्तास्तस्माद् रक्ष्या विशेषतः॥<br />Worthy of worship, highly blessed, virtuous, forming the light of their homes-such are the wives, who are the visible embodiments of household felicity. It is therefore, they should be specially protected.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>पितुरन्तःपुरं दद्यान्मातुर्दद्यान्महानसम्। गोषु चात्मसम दद्यात् स्वयमेव कृषि व्रजेत्॥<br />The supervision of the inner apartments should be entrusted to one's father, (that of) the kitchen should be entrusted to his mother, (that of) the cows should be entrusted to some body considered equal to himself; but the supervision of agriculture should be attended to by himself.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>भृत्यैर्वाणिज्यचारं च पुत्रैः सेवेत च द्विजान्। अद्ध्योऽग्निर्ब्रह्मतः क्षत्रमश्मनो लोहमुस्थितम्॥<br />The guests who carry on commerce should be waited on by servants; but the quests of the twice-born caste by one's sons. Out of water has arisen fore; and out of Brahma, the Kshatriya; and out of stone, iron.</p>

<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>क्षमावन्तो निराकाराः काष्ठेऽग्निरिव शेरते। यस्य मन्त्रं न जानन्ति बाहाचाभ्यन्तराश्च ये॥ स राजा सर्वतश्चक्षुश्चिरमैश्वर्यमश्नुते। करिष्यन् न प्रभाषेत कृतान्येव तु दर्शयेत्॥<br />Those born is high families are endued with a forgiving nature; and stay like fire in the wood without showing any outward symptoms. The king, whose intentions cannot be known by outsiders and even by his own officers and who has his eyes everywhere, enjoys long prosperity. One should not speak of what he wants to do, nor show what he has already done.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>धर्मकामार्थकार्याणि तथा मन्त्रो न भिद्यते। गिरिपृष्ठमुपारुह्य प्रासादं वा रहोगतः॥<br />Let not the intention, to do acts to be done either for virtue, worldly good or gratifying desires, be made known to others. Having ascended the top of a mountain or the roof of a palace.</p>

He, whose followers know all acts only after they are done or acts done for the sake of virtue, worldly good or gratification of desire, is the chief among kings, O king. The success of that king, whose intentions are not known is undoubted.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>अप्रशस्तानि कार्याणि यो मोहादनुतिष्ठति। स तेषां विपरिभ्रंशाद् भ्रंश्यते जीवितादपि।॥<br />He who does uncommendable acts out of ignorance loses even his life, owing to the unexpected consequences of his acts.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>कर्मणां तु प्रशस्तानामनुष्ठानं सुखावहम्। तेषामेवाननुष्ठानं पश्चात्तापकरं मतम्॥<br />The doing of acts that are commendable leads to happiness; the omission to do these acts causes injury afterwards, which is my opinion.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>अनधीत्य यथा वेदान् न विप्रः श्राद्धमर्हति। एवमश्रुतषाङ्गण्यो न मन्त्रं श्रोतुमर्हति॥<br />As a Brahmana, without studying the Vedas, is unfit to officiate at a Shradha, so one who has not heard of the six means (for protecting a kingdom) is not fit to hear of the purposes (of a king).</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>स्थानवृद्धिक्षयज्ञस्य षाडण्यविदितात्मनः। अनवज्ञातशीलस्य स्वाधीना पृथिवी नृप॥<br />One, who knows about the increase, decrease and surplus of revenue in the kingdom, who knows the six means and himself, one whose conduct is never spoken ill of, has the world under his subjection.</p>

<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>ब्राह्मणं ब्राह्मणो वेद भर्ता वेद स्त्रियं तथा। अमात्यं नृपतिर्वेद राजा राजानमेव च॥<br />A Brahmana knows a Brahmana in the same way as the nusband knows the wife. A king knows his minister and a monarch knows a monarch.</p>
<p id='27'><a href='#27'></a>न शत्रुर्वशमापन्नो मोक्तव्यो वध्यतां गतः। न्यग्भूत्वा पर्युपासीत वध्यं हन्याद् बले सति। अहताद्धि भयं तस्माज्जायते नचिरादिव॥<br />An enemy who deserves death should not be set liberty when under control. when one is weak, an enemy should be flattered though deserving of death; but he should be killed on the acquirement of strength. When not killed, dangers arise from him soon.</p>

<p id='31'><a href='#31'></a>न बुद्धिर्धनलाभाय न जाड्यसमृद्धये। लोकपर्यायवृत्तान्तं प्राज्ञो जानाति नेतरः॥<br />Intelligence is not for the acquirement of wealth; and laziness is not the cause of adversity. The wise man knows the history of the different conditions of man; but others do not.</p>
<p id='32'><a href='#32'></a>विद्याशीलवयोवृद्धान् बुद्धिवृद्धांश्च भारत। धनाभिजातवृद्धांश्च नित्यं मूढोऽवमन्यते॥<br />Fools have ever made light of those who are learned, old in age, old in intelligence, superior in wealth in wealth and in birth, O Bharata.</p>
<p id='33'><a href='#33'></a>अनार्यवृत्तमप्राज्ञमसूयकमधार्मिकम्। अनर्थाः क्षिप्रमायान्ति वाग्दुष्टं क्रोधनं तथा॥<br />Misery soon comes on him who leads a vicious life, who is wanting in wisdom, who is envious and sinful and who is wicked in speech and given to anger.</p>

<p id='36'><a href='#36'></a>धृतिः शमो दमः शौचं कारुण्यं वागनिष्ठुरा। मित्राणां चानभिद्रोहः सप्तैताः समिधः श्रियः॥<br />Wisdom, calmness of mind, self-control, holiness, the reverse of harshness in speech and the intention never to injure one's friends, these seven are to prosperity, even as fuel to the fire.</p>
