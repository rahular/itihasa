<h3>BHAGAVAD-YANA PARVA: Chapter 109</h3><h4>The story of Garuda</h4><p id='1'>सुपर्ण उवाच इयं विवस्वता पूर्वं श्रौतेन विधिना किल। गुरवे दक्षिणां दत्ता दक्षिणेत्युच्यते च दिक्॥<br />Suparna said This direction, in days of old, was given away by Vivasvat after the performance of a sacrifice according to the usual custom as a final present (Dakshina) to his spiritual guide; so this direction is called south (Dakshina).</p>
<p id='2'>अत्र लोकत्रयस्यास्य पितृपक्षः प्रतिष्ठितः। अत्रोष्मपाणां देवानां निवासः श्रूयते द्विज॥<br />In this direction do the Pitris of the three worlds live and it is said, O twice born one, that this is the residence of those gods that subsist on smoke.</p>
<p id='3'>अत्र विश्वे सदा देवाः पितृभिः सार्धमासते। इज्यमानाः स्म लोकेषु सम्प्राप्तास्तुल्यभागताम्॥<br />In this part of the universe the gods along with the Pitris ever reside, who are worshipped in sacrifices in the world and get equal share with the Pitris.</p>
<p id='4'>एतद् द्वितीयं देवस्य द्वारमाचक्षते द्विज। त्रुटिशो लवशश्चापि गण्यते कालनिश्चयः॥<br />This direction is said to be the second gate to virtue, O twice born one and here does the king of death, with a sure hand, calculate the life allotted to men, in Trutis and Lavas (periods of time).</p>
<p id='5'>अत्र देवर्षयो नित्यं पितृलोकर्षयस्तथा। तथा राजर्षयः सर्वे निवसन्ति गतव्यथा:॥<br />Here do the divine Rishis and the Rishis of the world of the Pitris as also Rishis of royal descent all reside, always being beyond the reach of pain.</p>
<p id='6'>अत्र धर्मश्च सत्यं च कर्म चात्र निगद्यते। गतिरेषा द्विजश्रेष्ठ कर्मणामवसायिनाम्॥<br />Here are virtue and truth, here the acts of men bear fruit and this is the refuge, O foremost among the twice born, of the acts of those that are dead.</p>
<p id='7'>एषा दिक् सा द्विजश्रेष्ठ यां सर्वः प्रतिपद्यते। वृता त्वनवबोधेन सुखं तेन न गम्यते॥<br />This is that direction, O foremost among the twice born, where every body must go; and as all of them are surrounded by the darkness of ignorance they cannot come here with perfect happiness.</p>
<p id='8'>नैर्ऋतानां सहस्राणि बहून्यत्र द्विजर्षभ। सृष्टानि प्रतिकूलानि द्रष्टव्यान्यकृतात्मभिः॥<br />Here are many thousands of Rakshasas, O best among the twice born, who have been created to stand in the way of men coming to these regions and who can be perceived by those who have not brought their souls under control.</p>
<p id='9'>अत्र मन्दरकुलेषु विप्रर्षिसदनेषु च। गायन्ति गाथा गन्धर्वाश्चित्तबुद्धिहरा द्विज॥<br />Here in the secluded spots of the Mandara mountains and in the residences of regenerate Rishis the Gandharvas chant songs stealing away the head and the heart, O twice born one.</p>
<p id='10'>अत्र सामानि गाथाभिः श्रुत्वा गीतानि रैवतः। गतदारो गतामात्यो गतराज्यो वनं गतः॥<br />The Daityas Raivata, having heard the hymns of the Samaveda chanted here, abandoned wife, friends and kingdoms and went into the forest.</p>
<p id='11'>अत्र सावर्णिना चैव यवक्रीतात्मजेन च। मर्यादा स्थापिता ब्रह्मन् यां सूर्यो नातिवर्तते॥<br />Here by the son of Savarni and that of Yavakrita was fixed a limit, O Brahmana, which Surya does not pass beyond.</p>
<p id='12'>अत्र राक्षसराजेन पौलस्त्येन महात्मना। रावणेन तपश्चीक़ सुरेभ्योऽमरता वृता॥<br />Here by the great-souled son of Pulastya Ravana, the king of Rakshasas who practiced austerities, was solicited immortality of the gods.</p>
<p id='13'>अत्र वृत्तेन वृत्रोऽपि शक्रशत्रुत्यमीयिवान्। अत्र सर्वासवः प्राप्ताः पुनर्गच्छन्ति पञ्चधा॥<br />Here by his habits of life did Vritra (the Asura) incur the hostility of Shankra and here do the lives of all being come and again dissolve into their five elephants.</p>
<p id='14'>अत्र दुष्कृतकर्माणो नराः पच्यन्ति गालव। अत्र वैतरणी नाम नदी वितरणैर्वृता।।१४]i<br />Here men, the doers of wicked acts, cannot go, O Galava and here is the river Vaitarani surrounded by people who cannot obtain salvation and cross it.</p>
<p id='15'>अत्र गत्वा सुखस्यान्तं दुःखस्यान्तं प्रपद्यते। अत्र वृत्तो दिनकरः सुरसं क्षरते पयः॥<br />Here do men come and attain to a termination of their happiness and misery and coming here does the maker of day (the sun) pour water having a nice taste.</p>
<p id='16'>काष्ठां चासाद्य वासिष्ठी हिमपुत्सृजते पुनः। अत्राहं गालव पुरा क्षुधातः परिचिन्तयन्॥<br />And having gone again to the cardinal point, pervaded by Vasishtha he lets fall dew; and here did I, in days of old being hungry and thinking about how to satisfy it.</p>
<p id='17'>लब्धवान् युध्यमानौ द्वौ बृहन्तौ गजकच्छपौ। अत्र चक्रधनुर्नाम सूर्याज्जातो महानृषिः॥<br />See fighting with each other, a large elephant and a big tortoise. Here was born from the sun the great Rishi named Chakradhanu,</p>
<p id='18'>विदुर्यं कपिलं देवं येनार्ताः सगरात्मजाः। अत्र सिद्धाः शिवा नाम ब्राह्मणा वेदपारगाः॥<br />Who was afterwards known as the god Kapila by whom were afflicted the sons of Sagara; and here did the class of Brahmanas known as Shivas, well versed in the Vedas, meet with success.</p>
<p id='19'>अधीत्य सकलान् वेदाँल्लेभिरे मोक्षमक्षयम्। अत्र भोगवती नाम पुरी वासुकिपालिता॥<br />And having studied all the Vedas, they obtained endless salvation; here is the city named Bhogavati ruled by Vasuki.</p>
<p id='20'>तक्षकेण च नागेन तथैवैरावतेन च। अत्र निर्याणकालेऽपि तमः सम्प्राप्यते महत्॥<br />And by the Naga, Takshaka and also by Airavala; and here at the time of their journey men meet with a great gloom.</p>
<p id='21'>अभेद्यं भास्करेणापि स्वयं वा कृष्णवर्त्मना। एष तस्यापि ते मार्गः परिचार्यस्य गालव। ब्रूहि मे यदि गन्तव्यं प्रतीची शृणु चापराम्॥<br />Which is impregnable even by Bhaskara (the sun himself) or by fire. Even this is your way, O Galava, worthy of attention, tell me if you want to go in this direction; listen now to the description of another direction, the west.</p>
