<h3>AMBOPAKHYANA PARVA: Chapter 188</h3><h4>Rama's fight with Bhishma</h4><p id='1'>राम उवाच प्रत्यक्षमेतल्लोकानां सर्वेषामेव भाविनि। यथाशक्त्या मया युद्धं कृतं वै पौरुषं परम्॥<br />Bhishma said In the very sight of all these persons O maiden, I have done better, according to the best of my power, and displayed my highest prowess.</p>
<p id='2'>न चैवमपि शक्नोमि भीष्मं शस्त्रभृतां वरम्। विशेषयितुमत्यर्थमुत्तमास्त्राणि दर्शयन्॥<br />And yet I have been unable to gain any superiority over Bhishma, that foremost of all wielders of weapons, though I have exerted to the very of my power.</p>
<p id='3'>एषा मे परमा शक्तिरेतन्मे परमं बलम्। यथेष्टं गम्यतां भद्रे किमन्यद् वा करोमि ते॥<br />This (which you have seen) is my highest might, this is greatest strength. Go whiter you like, O blessed lady. What else can I do for you?</p>
<p id='4'>भीष्ममेव प्रपद्यस्व न तेऽन्या विद्यते गतिः। निर्जितो ह्यस्मि भीष्मेण महास्त्राणि प्रमुञ्चता॥<br />Take refuge even with Bhishma himself; there exists no other for you. I am vanquished by Bhishma on account of his using such mighty weapons.</p>
<p id='5'>एवमुक्त्वा ततो रामो विनिःश्वस्य महामनाः। तूष्णीमांसीत् ततः कन्या प्रोवाच भृगुनन्दनम्॥<br />Then the high-souled Rama, having thus spoken, fetched a deep sign and remained silent. Then that maiden spoke to the descendant of Bhrigu.</p>
<p id='6'>भगवन्नेवमेवैतद् यथाऽऽहं भगवांस्तथा। अजेयो युधि भीष्मोऽयमपि देवरुदारधीः॥<br />"O holy one, it is even as your holy self has said. This Bhishma, of varied intelligence, is invincible in battle even by the very gods.</p>
<p id='7'>यथाशक्ति यथोत्साहं मम कार्यं कृतं त्वया। अनिवार्य रणे वीर्यमस्त्राणि विविधानि च।॥<br />To the best of your power and to the best of your energy you have accomplished my work, and in this battle you have shown irresistible might and diverse kinds of weapons.</p>
<p id='8'>न चैव शक्यते युद्धे विशेषयितुमन्ततः। न चाहमेनं यास्यामि पुनर्भीष्मं कथंचन॥ गमिष्यामि तु तत्राहं यत्र भीष्मं तपोधन। समरे पातयिष्यामि स्वयमेव भृगूद्वह॥<br />You have yet been unable to show any superiority (over Bhishma). As for me I shall not go again to this Bhishma. Thither, however, shall I repair, where, O you whose wealth is asceticism, I shall be able myself to (obtain the means to fell down in battle this Bhishma, O you the perpetuator of the race of Bhrigu."</p>
<p id='9'>एवमुक्त्वा ययौ कन्या रोषव्याकुललोचना। तापस्ये धृतसंकल्या सा मे चिन्तयती वधम्॥<br />Having spoken thus, that maid went away with eyes agitated with wrath, and intending to bring about my death she firmly resolved to practice asceticism,</p>
<p id='10'>ततो महेन्द्रं सह तैर्मुनिभिर्भृगुसत्तमः। यथाऽऽगतं तथा सोऽगान्मामुपामन्त्र्य भारत॥<br />Then that foremost one among Bhrigu's defendants, accompanied by those ascetics, departed, after bidding me farewell for the mountain of Mahendra, O Bharata, whence he had come.</p>
<p id='11'>ततो रथं समारुह्य स्तूयमानो द्विजातिभिः। प्रविश्य नगरं मात्रे सत्यवत्यै न्यवेदयम्॥<br />Thereupon, sending my chariot, and praised by the twice-born, I entered the city and immediately informed Satyavati, my mother,</p>
<p id='12'>यथावृत्तं महाराज सा च मां प्रत्यनन्दत। पुरुषांश्चादिशं प्राज्ञान् कन्यावृत्तान्तकर्मणि॥<br />Every thing as it had happened, O great king, and she (in her turn) uttered words and congratulations to me. I then appointed intelligent and wise men to watch the proceedings of that maiden.</p>
<p id='13'>दिवसे दिवसे ह्यस्या गतिजल्पितचेष्टितम्। प्रत्याहरंश्च मे युक्ताः स्थिताः प्रियहिते सदा॥<br />Day after day, they went and learnt whatever she did, being devoted and always stationed at their duty, and brought them to me, always their well-wisher.</p>
<p id='14'>यदैव हि वनं प्रायात् सा कन्या तपसे धृता। तदैव व्यतितो दीनो गतचेता इवाभवम्॥<br />Even at the time when that maiden went to the woods best on practicing asceticism, I became melancholy and poorly with pain.</p>
<p id='15'>न हि मां क्षत्रियः कश्चिद् वीर्येण व्यजयद् युधि। ऋते ब्रह्मविदस्तात तपसा संशितव्रतात्॥<br />No Kshatriya has ever by mere prowess vanquished me in battle, except one acquainted with Brahma, O my son and observant of vows and austerities.</p>
<p id='16'>अपि चैतन्मया राजन् नारदेऽपि निवेदितम्। व्यासे चैव तथा कार्यं तौ चोभौ मामवोचताम्॥<br />I then informed even Narada, O king, and also Vyasa of the doings (of that daughter of the king of Kashi), and both of them said to me.</p>
<p id='17'>न विषादस्त्वया कार्यो भीष्म काशिसुतां प्रति। दैवं पुरुषकारेण को निवर्तितुमुत्सहेत्॥<br />"O Bhishma, you need not be depressed on account of the daughter of Kashi. Who can have the power to alter the course of destiny by individual resolution?</p>

<p id='19'>निराहारा कृशा सक्षा जटिला मलपङ्किनी। षण्मासान् वायुभक्षा च स्थाणुभूता तपोधना॥ यमुनाजलमाश्रित्य संवत्सरमथापरम्। उदवासं निराहारा पारयामास भाविनी॥<br />And she remained in the water of the Yamuna for one year, and another year, that lady remained fasting without food. Without food and emaciated, rough skined, and bronzed, with matted locks, and begrimed with the mud (of the river), that lady, whose wealth consisted in asceticism, remained fixed and motionless for six months, her only food being the air.</p>
<p id='20'>शीर्णपणेन चैकेन पारयामास सा परम्। संवत्सरं तीव्रकोपा पादाङ्गुष्ठाग्रधिष्ठिता॥<br />And after this she broke her fast by eating a single dry leaf, and then she the great river on one foot fire with indignation as she was.</p>
<p id='21'>एवं द्वादश वर्षाणि तापयामास रोदसी। निवर्त्यमानापि च सा ज्ञातिभि:व शक्यते॥<br />And thus she continued for twelve years (her austerities) and made the heaven not. Nor could she be made to desist from the course by her relatives.</p>
