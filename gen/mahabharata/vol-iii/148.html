<h3>BHAGAVAD-YANA PARVA: Chapter 78</h3><h4>Speech of Arjuna</h4><p id='1'>अर्जुन उवाच उक्तं युधिष्ठिरेणैव यावद् वाच्यं जनार्दन। तव वाक्यं तु मे श्रुत्वा प्रतिभाति परंतप॥<br />Arjuna said By Yudhishthira has been uttered all that ought to be spoken, O Janardana; but hearing your words, O chastiser of foes, it seems to me.</p>
<p id='2'>नैव प्रशममत्र त्वं मन्यसे सुकरं प्रभो। लोभाद् वा धृतराष्ट्रस्य दैन्याद् वा समुपस्थितात्॥<br />That you do not consider peace to be easily obtainable in this instance, O Lord, owing either to avarice on the part of Dhritarashtra or the weakness of ourselves.</p>
<p id='3'>अफलं मन्यसे वाऽपि पुरुषस्य पराक्रमम्। न चान्तरेण कर्माणि पौरुषेण फलोदयः॥<br />You consider, too, that human strength (alone) is without avail and that human desires are fruitless save when attended with action.</p>
<p id='4'>तदिदं भाषितं वाक्यं तथा च न तथैव तत्। न चैतदेवं द्रष्टव्यमसाध्यमपि किंचन॥<br />These words spoken by you may or may not be true; but there is nothing which ought to be regarded as incapable of attainment.</p>
<p id='5'>किं चैतन्मन्यसे कृच्छ्रमस्माकमवसादकम्। कुर्वन्ति तेषां कर्माणि येषां नास्ति फलोदयः॥<br />You consider peace to be improbable owing to our weakness; but they are doing deeds, which do not seem to bear fruits.</p>
<p id='6'>सम्पाद्यमानं सम्यक् च स्यात् कर्म सफलं प्रभो। स तथा कृष्ण वर्तस्व यथा शर्म भवेत् परैः॥<br />Done in a proper way, however, our object may be successful, O lord, therefore, O Krishna, act in such a way that there may be enemy.</p>
<p id='7'>पाण्डवानां कुरूणां च भवान् नः प्रथमः सुहृत्। सुराणामसुराणां च यथा वीर प्रजापतिः॥<br />You are the best well-wisher of ourselves, of both the Kurus and the Pandavas; as the hero Prajapati was of the Suras and the Asuras.</p>
<p id='8'>कुरूणां पाण्डवानां च प्रतिपत्स्व निरामयम्। अस्मद्धितमनुष्ठानं मन्ये तव न दुष्करम्॥<br />Do, therefore, that which is conducive to the interests of both the Kurus and the Pandavas. I think that the accomplishment of what is for our good is not difficult for you; and this is a work which is the proper thing for you to do, O Janardana.</p>
<p id='9'>एवं च कार्यतामेति कार्यं तव जनार्दन। गमनादेवमेव त्वं करिष्यसि जनार्दन।॥<br />You will accomplish this, as soon as you go there, O Janardana; and, O hero, if any other treatment of that evil-souled one is derived by you; it will be as you wish, whether it is to be peace with them or not or whatever is desired by you.</p>
<p id='10'>चिकीर्षितमथान्यत् ते तस्मिन् वीर दुरात्मनि। भविष्यति च तत् सर्वं यथा तवचिकीर्षितम्॥<br />O Krishna, whatever you desire after mature deliberation will be accepted by us with due respect. Is not death proper for that evil-minded one, as well as for his friends and sons?</p>
<p id='11'>शर्म तैः सह वा नोऽस्तु तव वा यच्चिकीर्षितम्। विचार्यमाणो यः कामस्तव कृष्ण स नो गुरुः। न स नार्हति दुष्टात्मा वधं ससुतबान्धवः॥<br />By whom was seen the beauty of prosperity established on the son of Dharma; and who on seeing that had no righteous means (of wining the kingdom) O slayer of Madhu.</p>
<p id='12'>येन धर्मसुते दृष्टा न सा श्रीरुपमर्षिता। यच्चाप्यपश्यतोपायं धर्मिष्ठं मधुसूदन॥<br />They robbed us (of our kingdom) by the cruel and sinful means of a deceitful game at dice. Where is the wielder of the bow, who though born in a Kshatriya family.</p>
<p id='13'>उपायेन नृशंसेन हृता दुर्दूतदेविना। कथं हि पुरुषो जातः क्षत्रियेषु धनुर्धरः॥<br />When challenged (for battle) turns back even when death stares on him? Seeing ourselves defeated by deceit and while wandering in the woods.</p>
<p id='14'>समाहूतो निवर्तेत प्राणत्यागेऽप्युपस्थिते। अधर्मेण जितान् दृष्ट्वा वने प्रव्रजितांस्तथा॥ वध्यतां मम वार्ष्णेय निर्गतोऽसौ सुयोधनः। न चैतदद्भुतं कृष्ण मित्रार्थं यच्चिकीर्षसि। क्रिया कथं च मुख्या स्यान्मृदुना चेतरेण वा॥<br />Did I think that Suyodhana ought to be slain by me when I came out of the forest, O you of the Vrishini race; but what you desire to do on behalf of your friends is not strange, O Krishna, though how that is capable of accomplishment by mildness or by other means (I do not see).</p>
<p id='15'>अथवा मन्यसे ज्यायान् वधस्तेषामनन्तरम्। तदेव क्रियतामाशु न विचार्यमतस्त्वया॥<br />If you consider their immediate destruction better, do that instantly for there is nothing to be considered about in this matter.</p>
<p id='16'>जानासि हि यथैतेन द्रौपदी पापबुद्धिना। परिक्लिष्टा सभामध्ये तच्च तस्योपमर्षितम्॥<br />You know, how by that evil-minded one Draupadi was troubled and annoyed in the midst of the Council and that act of his was borne with difficulty.</p>
<p id='17'>स नाम सम्यग् वर्तेत पाण्डवेष्विति माधव। न मे संजायते बुद्धिर्बीजमुप्तमिवोषरे॥<br />That he should treat the Pandavas justly, O Madhava, dose not seem possible to me. Good counsel to him will give the same result as seed thrown on barren lands.</p>
<p id='18'>तस्माद् यन्मन्यसे युक्तं पाण्डवानां हितं च यत्। तथाऽऽशु कुरु वार्ष्णेय यन्नः कार्यमनन्तरम्॥<br />There for what you consider proper and beneficial for Kurus, What ought to be done next by us, do immediately.</p>
