<h3>YANASANDHI PARVA: Chapter 59</h3><h4>The speech of Krishna</h4><p id='1'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच यदबूतां महात्मानौ वासुदेवधनंजयौ। तन्मे ब्रूहि महाप्राज्ञ शुश्रूषे वचनं तव॥<br />Dhritarashtra said What the two great-souled ones, the son of Vasudeva and Dhananjaya, said? Tell me that, O exceedingly wise one. I shall hear your words.</p>
<p id='2'>संजय उवाच शृणु राजन् यथा दृष्टौ मया कृष्णधनंजयौ। ऊचतुश्चापि यद् वीरौ तत् ते वक्ष्यामि भारत॥<br />Sanjaya said Listen, O king, how the two, Krishna and Dhananjaya, were seen by me and what the two heroes said. I shall tell you, O Bharata.</p>
<p id='3'>पादाङ्गुलीरभिप्रेक्षन् प्रयतोऽहं कृताञ्जलिः। शुद्धान्तं प्राविशं राजन्नाख्यातुं नरदेवयोः॥<br />Looking towards my toes and with my hands clasped together and thinking of holy things in my mind, did I enter the inner apartments to meet with those gods among men.</p>
<p id='4'>नैवाभिमन्युर्न यमौ तं देशमभियान्ति वै। यत्र कृष्णौ च कृष्णा च सत्यभामा च भामिनी॥<br />Neither Abhimanyu nor the twins can go to the place where the two Krishna and Krishna (Draupadi) and the lady Satyabhama reside.</p>
<p id='5'>उभौ मध्वासवक्षीबावुभौ चन्दनरूषितौ। स्रग्विणौ वरवस्त्रौ तौ दिव्याभरणभूषितौ॥<br />The two were there, cheerful with a drink of the Madri wine; and both had their bodies smeared with sandal; and both also were dressed in excellent attires and wore beautiful ornaments.</p>
<p id='6'>नैकरत्नविचित्रं तु काञ्चनं महदासनम्। विविधास्तरणाकीर्णं यत्रासातामरिंदमौ॥<br />The two subduer of enemies were seated there on a spacious seat of gold covered with many sorts of carpets.</p>
<p id='7'>अर्जुनोत्सङ्गगौ पादौ केशवस्योपलक्षये। अर्जुनस्य च कृष्णायां सत्यायां च महात्मनः॥<br />On the lap of Arjuna were the feet of Keshava and those of the noble-minded Arjuna rested on Krishna and Satyabhama.</p>
<p id='8'>काञ्चनं पादपीठं तु पार्थो मे प्रादिशत् तदा। तदहं पाणिना स्पृष्ट्वा ततो भूमावुपाविशम्॥<br />A seat made of gold did the son of Pritha point out to me; after touching which with my hands, I took my seat on the ground.</p>
<p id='9'>ऊर्ध्वरेखातलौ पादौ पार्थस्य शुभलक्षणौ। पादपीठादपहतौ तत्रापश्यमहं शुभौ॥<br />Two longitudinal lines on the soles of the son of Pritha, the auspicious marks, did I see on his taking away his feet from the seat.</p>
<p id='10'>श्यामौ बृहन्तौ तरुणौ शालस्कन्धाविवोद्गतौ। एकासनगतौ दृष्ट्वा भयं मां महदाविशत्॥<br />Having seen the two young men of black complexion and large stature rising like the trunks of Shala trees, seated on the same seat, a great fear seized me.</p>
<p id='11'>इन्द्रविष्णुसमावेतौ मन्दात्मा नावबुद्ध्यते। संश्रयाद् द्रोणभीष्माभ्यां कर्णस्य च विकत्थनात्॥<br />They were like Indra and Vishnu seated together. That one of foolish intellect does not understand that owing to his belief in the power of Drona and Bhishma.</p>
<p id='12'>निदेशस्थाविमौ यस्य मानसस्तस्य सेत्स्यते। संकल्पो धर्मराजस्य निश्चयो मे तदाभवत्॥<br />The wishes of him who had under his command these two, the desires of the king of virtue were bound to bear fruit such was my belief at the time.</p>
<p id='13'>सत्कृतश्चान्नपानाभ्यामासीनो लब्धसक्रियः। अञ्जलिं मूर्ध्नि संधाय तौ संदेशमचोदयम्॥<br />Entertained with food and drink and having my wishes (of beholding the two) gratified, I placed my clasped hands on my head and conveyed to them your message.</p>
<p id='14'>धनुर्गुणकिणाङ्केन पाणिना शुभलक्षणम्। पादमानमयन् पार्थः केशवं समचोदयत्॥<br />With his hands, having auspicious signs and marks made by friction with the bow and string, the son of Pritha removing the feet of Keshava asked him to give a suitable reply.</p>
<p id='15'>इन्द्रकेतुरिवोत्थाय सर्वाभरणभूषितः। इन्द्रवीर्योपमः कृष्णः संविष्टो माभ्यभाषत॥ वाचं स वदतां श्रेष्ठो ह्लादिनीं वचनक्षमाम्। त्रासिनीं धार्तराष्ट्राणां मृदुपूर्वां सुदारुणाम्॥<br />Then did Krishna of prowess similar to Indra's and adorned with all sorts of ornaments and rising like the banner of Indra speak addressing me, the words of that foremost of the speakers were mild, charming and conciliatory but were awful and calculated to cause fear in the sons of Dhritarashtra.</p>
<p id='16'>वाचं तां वचनार्हस्य शिक्षाक्षरसमन्विताम्। अश्रौषमहमिष्टार्था पश्चाद्धृदयहारिणीम्॥<br />I then heard the words of that one who is fit to speak, which were rhythmical and calculated to lead to the good of all, though heart-rending in the end.</p>
<p id='17'>वासुदेव उवाच संजयेदं वचो ब्रूया धृतराष्ट्र मनीषिणम्। कुरुमुख्यस्य भीष्मस्य द्रोणस्यापि च शृण्वतः॥<br />The son of Vasudeva said O Sanjaya, speak these words to the intelligent Dhritarashtra in the hearing of the foremost of Kurus, Bhishma and Drona.</p>
<p id='18'>आवयोर्वचनात् सूत ज्येष्ठानप्यभिवादयन्। यवीयसश्च कुशलं पश्चात् पृष्ट्वैवमुत्तरम्॥<br />Before repeating our answer, O Suta, convey our respects to our elders in age and then asking about the health of our younger,</p>
<p id='19'>यजध्वं विविधैर्यज्ञैविप्रेभ्यो दत्त दक्षिणाः। पुत्रैर्दारैश्च मोदध्वं महद् वो भयमागतम्॥<br />Perform many sorts of sacrificial ceremonies and make many presents to the Brahmanas and make merry with your sons and wives; for a heavy calamity is come on you.</p>
<p id='20'>अर्थांस्त्यजत पात्रेभ्युः सुतान् प्राप्नुत कामजान्। प्रियं प्रियेभ्यश्चरत राजा हि त्वरते जये॥<br />Distribute wealth among proper recipients; get desirable sons and serve those that are dear to you by doing them good; for the king is anxious for victory.</p>
<p id='21'>ऋणमेतत् प्रवृद्धं मे हृदयानापसर्पति। यद् गोविन्देति चुक्रोश कृष्णा मां दूरवासिनम्॥<br />That old debt has not yet been wiped off from my mind (for I have not paid it), that is the invocation of me living at a distance by Krishna saying "Govinda".</p>
<p id='22'>तेजोमयं दुराधर्षं गाण्डीवं यस्य कार्मुकम्। मद्वितीयेन तेनेह वैरं वः सव्यसाचिना॥<br />Him whose weapon is the invisible Gandiva bow, full of energy and him who has me for his second-of such Savyasachin have you made enemy.</p>
<p id='23'>मद्वितीयं पुनः पार्थं कः प्रार्थयितुमिच्छति। यो न कालपरीतो वाप्यपि साक्षात् पुरंदरः॥<br />Who would like to challenge the son of Pritha, having me for his second, unless his time were come, even if he were Purandara himself?</p>
<p id='24'>बाहुभ्यामुद्वहेद् भूमि दहेत् क्रुद्ध इमाः प्रजाः। पातयेत् त्रिदिवाद् देवान् योऽर्जुनं समरे जयेत्॥<br />He who defeats Arjuna in battle bears the earth in his two arms; and when wrathful, he could burn up all creatures and could make the gods fall off from heaven.</p>
<p id='25'>देवासुरमनुष्येषु यक्षगन्धर्वभोगिषु। न तं पश्याम्यहं युद्धे पाण्डवं योऽभ्ययाद् रणे॥<br />Among the gods, the Asuras and the human beings and among Yakshas, Gandharvas and Bhogis do I not see him, who could stand against (Arjuna), the son of Pandu, in battle.</p>
<p id='26'>यत् तद् विराटनगरे श्रुयते महदद्भुतम्। एकस्य च बहूनां च पर्याप्तं तन्निदर्शनम्॥<br />The greatly wonderful event, which is heard to have taken place in the city of Virata of a fight of one against many, is a sufficient proof of this.</p>
<p id='27'>एकेन पाण्डुपुत्रेण विराटनगरे यदा। भग्नाः पलायत दिशः पर्याप्तं तन्निदर्शनम्॥<br />When in the city of Virata you fled in all directions, dispersed by the son of Pandu alone that is sufficient proof of this.</p>
<p id='28'>बलं वीर्यं च तेजश्च शीघ्रता लघुहस्तता। अविषादश्च धैर्यं च पार्थान्नान्यत्र विद्यते॥<br />Strength, heroism, prowess, agility, lightness of hand, untiring energy and patience are centered in the son of Pritha and are not present anywhere else.</p>
<p id='29'>इत्यब्रवीद्धृषीकेशः पार्थमुद्धर्षयन् गिरा। गर्जन् समयवर्षीव गगने पाकशासनः॥<br />Thus spoke Hrishikesha cheering the spirits of the son of Pritha by his voice and roaring like the instrument which chastised Paka (thunder) in the sky during the rainy season.</p>
<p id='30'>केशवस्य वचः श्रुत्वा किरीटी श्वेतवाहनः। अर्जुनस्तन्महद् वाक्यमब्रवीद् रोमहर्षणम्॥<br />Having heard the words of Keshava, Kiritin of white steeds, Arjuna spoke significant words calculated to make the hairs erect.</p>
