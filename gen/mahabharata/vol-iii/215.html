Why are you come here? Tell me what I shall do for you.</p>

<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>उपपन्नो गुणैः सर्वैयेष्ठः श्रेष्ठेषु बन्धुषु। सूतपुत्रेति मा शब्दः पार्थस्त्वमसि वीर्यवान्॥<br />Endued with all accomplishments you are eldest among all my best relatives; do not use again the term “the son of a Suta" for you are the son of Pritha, endued with prowess.</p>
