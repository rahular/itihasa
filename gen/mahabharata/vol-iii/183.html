<p id='2'>अभिवाद्य सुपर्णस्तु गालवश्चाभिपूज्य ताम्। तया च स्वागतेनोक्तौ विष्टरे संनिषीदतुः॥<br />Suparna having done her honors, and Galava having worshipped her they were pointed to a seat by her after the usual welcome.</p>
<p id='3'>सिद्धमन्नं तया दत्तं बलिमन्त्रोपबृंहितम्। भुक्त्वा तृप्तावुभौ भूमौ सुप्तौ तावनुमोहितौ॥<br />Both, of them, having partaken of the cooked food offered by her after having dedicated the same to the gods with the usual Mantra, were refreshed and both of them slept on the ground and in a moment lost their senses.</p>

<p id='7'>किं नु ते मनसा ध्यातमशुभं धर्मदूषणम्। न ह्ययं भवतः स्वल्पो व्यभिचारो भविष्यति॥<br />Is it that in your mind you have entertained a thought which is evil and against the dictates of virtue; this is the result of no small wickedness on your part.</p>
<p id='8'>सुपर्णोऽथाब्रवीद् विप्रं प्रध्यातं वै मया द्विज। इमां सिद्धामितो नेतुं तत्र यत्र प्रजापतिः॥<br />Suparna then said to the regenerate one o twice born one, the thought has indeed been entertained by me of carrying away this lady who has been endued with asceticism from this place to where the lord of all creatures is,</p>
<p id='9'>यत्र देवो महादेवो यत्र विष्णुः सनातनः। यत्र धर्मश्च यज्ञश्च तत्रेयं निवसेदिति॥<br />Where resides the lord Mahadeva, where resides the eternal Vishnu and where there are virtue and sacrificial ceremonies, so that she might live there.</p>
<p id='10'>सोऽहं भगवती याचे प्रणतः प्रियकाम्यया। मयैतन्नाम प्रध्यातं मनसा शोचता किल॥<br />I now pray this goddess for my own good with my head bowed down: I have harbored this thought in my mind and have come to grief consequence thereof.</p>
<p id='11'>तदेवं बहुमानात् ते मयेहानीप्सितं कृतम्। सुकृतं दुष्कृतं वात्वं माहात्म्यात् क्षन्तुमर्हसि॥<br />Out of great respect (for you) did I entertain the thought and whether I did right or wrong, it is fitting that out of your own generosity and noble mindedness you should forgive me. in</p>

<p id='13'>निन्दितास्मि त्वया वत्स न च निन्दा क्षमाम्यहम्। लोकेभ्यः सपदि भ्रश्येद् यो मां निन्देत पापकृत्॥<br />I have been insulted by your child and I do not forgive insults; that perpetrator of wicked deeds, who would insult me, would quickly be turned out of all regions of bliss.</p>
<p id='14'>हीनयालक्षणैः सर्वैस्तथानिन्दितया मया। आचारं प्रतिगृह्णन्त्या सिद्धिः प्राप्तेयमुत्तमा॥<br />Devoid as I am of all inauspicious signs, and who am blameless, I have obtained excellent asceticism by following the rules of good conduct.</p>
<p id='15'>आचारः फलते धर्ममाचारः फलते धनम्। आचाराच्छ्यिमाप्नोति आचारो हन्त्यलक्षणम्॥<br />Good conduct produces virtue, good conduct produces wealth and it is from good conduct that a man attains to prosperity; and good conduct nullifies all inauspicious signs.</p>
<p id='16'>तदायुष्मन् खगपते यथेष्टं गम्यतामितः। न च ते गर्हणीयाऽहं गर्हितव्याः स्त्रियः क्वचित्॥<br />Do you now, O lord of the rangers of the firinament, go wherever you like; no woman should henceforth be found fault with by you even when she ought to be blamed.</p>

<p id='19'>विश्वामित्रोऽथ तं दृष्ट्वागालवं चाध्वनि स्थितः। उवाच वदतां श्रेष्ठो वैनतेयस्य संनिधौ॥<br />Vishvamitra, while standing on the path, saw Galava and that foremost among speakers said in the presence of the son of Vinata.</p>

<p id='22'>सुपर्णोऽथाब्रवीद् दीनं गालवं भृशदुःखितम्। प्रत्यक्षं खल्विदानी मे विश्वामित्रो यदुक्तवान्।॥<br />Suparna then said to Galava who was struck with great sorrow, "What Vishvamitra said to you before, he has repeated in my presence.</p>
<p id='23'>तदागच्छ द्विजश्रेष्ठ मन्त्रयिष्याव गालव। नादत्त्वा गुरवे शक्यं कृत्स्नमर्थत्वयाऽऽसितुम्॥<br />Therefore do you come, O foremost among the twice-born, we shall consult together ( Galava; without giving to your preceptor the whole of the wealth promised by you, you cannot even sit down."</p>
