<h3>GOHARANA PARVA: Chapter 55</h3><h4>Arjuna's pointing out of Kurus to Uttara i Goharana</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच अपयाते तु राधेये दुर्योधनपुरोगमाः। अनीकेन यथास्वेन शनैरार्छन्त पाण्डवम्॥<br />Vaishampayana said After the son of Radha had fled away fi the battle-field all other heroes, headed Duryodhana attacked Arjuna with respective detachments.</p>
<p id='2'>बहुधा तस्य सैन्यस्य व्यूढस्याप्ततः शरैः। अधारयत वेगं स वेलेव तु महोदधेः॥<br />Like the bank (obstructing the surging) deep he withstood the various well-arranged divisions of the army falling upon him with arrows.</p>
<p id='3'>ततः प्रहस्य बीभत्सुः कौन्तेयः श्वेतवाहनः। दिव्यमस्त्रं प्रकुर्वाणः प्रत्यायाद् रथसत्तमः॥<br />Then smiling, the foremost of car-warriors Bibhatsu, the son of Kunti, having white, steeds, advanced (towards them) displaying celestials weapons.</p>
<p id='4'>यथा रश्मिभिरादित्यः प्रच्छादयति मेदिनीम्। तथा गाण्डीवनिर्मुक्तैः शरैः पार्थो दिशो दश॥<br />Partha soon filled the ten quarters with arrows shot from his Gandiva bow as the sun covers the earth with its rays.</p>
<p id='5'>न रथानां न चाश्वानां न गजानां न वर्मणाम्। अनिविद्धं शितैर्बाणैरासीद द्वयङ्गुलमन्तरम्॥<br />Of the chariots, horses, elephants and coats of mail there was not space measuring even two fingers that was nor pierced with shafts.</p>
<p id='6'>दिव्ययोगाच्च पार्थस्य हयानामुत्तरस्य च। शिक्षाशिल्पोपपन्नत्वादस्त्राणां च परिक्रमात्।<br />On account of his cleverly handling the celestials weapons, the training of his horses, the skill of Uttara and the coursing of his weapons.</p>
<p id='7'>वीर्यवत्त्वं दुतं चाग्नयं दृष्ट्वा जिष्णोरपूजयन्॥ कालाग्निमिव बीभत्सुं निर्दहन्तमिव प्रजाः।<br />And seeing him endued with energy prowess and quick motion people began to adore Vishnu like fire burning at the time of the universal dissolution.</p>
<p id='8'>नारयः प्रेक्षितुं शेकुर्व्वलन्तमिव पावकम्॥ तानि ग्रस्तान्यनीकानि रेजुरर्जुनमार्गणैः।<br />None amongst the enemies could look at Arjuna shining like the burning fire. Assailed by the shafts of Arjuna the various divisions of the army appeared.</p>
<p id='9'>शैलं प्रति बलाभ्राणि व्याप्तानीवार्करश्मिभिः॥ अशोकानां वनानीवच्छननानि बहुशः शुभैः।<br />Like the newly risen clouds on a mountain, filled with the rays of the sun or like the gioves of the Ashoka trees covered with full blown flowers.</p>
<p id='10'>रेजुः पार्थशरैस्तत्र तदा सैन्यानि भारत॥ स्रजोऽर्जुनशरैः शीर्णं शुष्यत्पुष्पं हिरण्मयम्। छत्राणि च पताकाश्च खे दधार सदागतिः॥<br />Thus assailed by Partha's shafts the army appeared, O Bharata, like a garland from which the withered but golden flowers drop down.</p>
<p id='11'>स्वबलत्रासनात्रस्ता: परिपेतुर्दिशो दश। रथाङ्गदेशानादाय पार्थच्छिन्नयुगा हयाः॥ कर्णकक्षविषाणेषु अन्तरोष्ठेषु चैव ह। मर्मस्वङ्गेषु चाहत्यापातयत् समरे गजान्॥ कौरवाग्रगजानां तु शरीरैर्गतचेतसाम्। क्षणेन संवृता भूमिर्मेधैरिव नभस्तलम्॥ युगान्तसमये सर्वं यथा स्थावरजङ्गमम्। कालक्षयमशेषेण दहत्यग्रशिखः शिखी। तद्वत् पार्थो महाराज ददाह समरे रिपू॥ ततः सर्वास्त्रतेजोभिर्धनुषो निस्वनेन च शब्देनामानुषाणां च भूतानां ध्वजवासिनाम्।<br />The wind carried away to the sky the umbrellas and the flags. Terrified at the destruction of their own species and having their reins cut off by Partha's arrows the horses, taking with them, portions of cars, fled away in different directions. Struck on their ears, ribs, tusks, the lower lips and other vital parts the elephants began to drop down in the battle-field. Filled in no time with the dead elephants of the Kurus the earth looked like the sky filled with black clouds. As the blazing fire burns up all mobile and immobile, at the time of the universal dissolution, so did Partha, O king, consume the enemies in battle. Then with the power of all his weapons, the twang of his bow and superhuman cries of the creatures stationed on his Flag-staff.</p>
<p id='12'>भैरवं शब्दमत्यर्थं वानरस्य च कुर्वतः॥ दैवारिपाच्च बीभत्सुस्तस्मिन् दौर्योधने वने। भयमुत्पादयामास बलवानरिमर्दनः॥ रथशक्तिममित्राणां प्रागेव निपतद् भुवि।<br />And the dreadful yell of the monkey, Bibhatsu struck terror into the hearts of Duryodhana's soldiers. A highly powerful repressor of enemies as he was, he had already crushed to the ground the strength of the hostile heroes.</p>
<p id='13'>सोऽपयात् सहसा पश्चात् साहसाच्चाभ्युपेयिवान्॥ शरवातैः सुतीक्ष्णाप्रैः समादिष्टैः खगेरिव।<br />He all on a sudden from behind attacked the army with a net of sharpened arrows like birds ordered (by fowlers).</p>
<p id='14'>अर्जुनस्तु खमावतें लोहितप्राशनैः खगैः॥ अत्र मध्ये यथार्कस्य रश्मयस्तिग्मतेजसः। दिशासु च तथा राजन्नसंख्याताः शरास्तदा।॥ सकृदेवानतं शेकू स्थमभ्यसितुं परे।<br />Arjuna covered the entire sky with blooddrinking arrows. As the fierce rays of the sun are within a small vessel. O king, those numberless shafts of his were in the sky. They could see once his car only when brought near.</p>
<p id='15'>अलभ्यः पुनस्श्वैस्तु रथात् सोऽतिप्रपादयेत्॥ ते शरा द्विट्शरीरेषु यथैव न ससज्जिरे।<br />And no sooner they saw him he felled them from the chariot with their horses. As his arrows were not impeded by the bodies of his enemies.</p>
<p id='16'>द्विडनीकेषु बीभत्सोर्न ससज्जे रथस्तदा॥ स तद् विक्षोभयामास ह्यरातिबलवासा।<br />So the car of Bibhatsu was not obstructed by the army of the enemy. He, with great force, began to agitate the army of the enemy.</p>
<p id='17'>अनन्तभोगो भुजगः क्रीडन्निव महार्णवे॥ अस्यतो नित्यमत्यर्थं सर्वमेवातिगस्तथा। अश्रुतः श्रूयते भूतैर्धनुर्घोषः किरीटिनः॥ संततास्तत्र मातङ्गा बाणैरल्पान्तरान्तरे। संवृतास्तेन दृश्यन्ते मेघा इव गभस्तिभिः॥ दिशोऽनुभ्रमतः सर्वाः सव्यदक्षिणमस्यतः। सततं दृश्यते युद्धे सायकासनमण्डलम्॥<br />Like the thousand headed serpent Vasuki sporting in the great ocean. As Kiriti continually shot his arrows such was the twang of his bow, going above every sound that the like of if was never heard by creatures. The elephants, that were there with their bodies thickly covered with arrows, looked like black clouds filled with the rays of the sun. Moving in all directions and shooting arrows right and left Arjuna's bow was always seen in the battle like a circle.</p>
<p id='18'>पतन्त्यरूपेषु यथा चक्षूर्षि न कदाचन। नालक्ष्येषु शराः पेतुस्तथा गाण्डीवधन्वनः॥ मार्गो गजसहस्रस्य युगपद् गच्छतो वने। यथा भवेत् तथा जज्ञे रथमार्गः किरीटिनः॥ नूनं पार्थजयैषित्वाच्छक्रः सर्वामरैः सह। हन्त्यस्मानित्यमन्यन्त पार्थेन निहताः परे॥ कालमर्जुनरूपेण संहरन्तमिव प्रजाः॥<br />The arrows of the holder of the Gandiva bow never fell upon anything except the aim as the eye does not fall upon anything except what is beautiful. As the passage for a thousand of elephants is made of itself when they simultaneously pass through a forest so the track of the chariot of Kiritin was made out. Greatly assailed by Partha the enemies thought, “Desirous of securing victory to Partha forsooth, Indra, in the company of all the immortals, is destroying us."</p>
<p id='19'>घ्नन्तमत्यर्थमहितान् विजयं तत्र मेनिरे। कुरुसेनाशरीराणि पार्थेनैवाहतान्यपि। सेदुः पार्थहतानीव पार्थकर्मानुशासनात्॥ ओषधीनां शिरांसीव द्विषच्छीर्षाणि सोऽन्वयात्।<br />They also took Vijaya, who was making a dreadful havoc all round, to be Death himself, who in the guise of Arjuna, was putting an end to all creatures around. And wounded by Partha the bodies of the Kuru soldiers were distressed like those slain by Partha by his superhuman deed. He sundered the heads of the enemies like the tops of Oshadhis.</p>
<p id='20'>अवनेशुः कुरूणां हि वीर्याण्यर्जुनजाद् भयात्॥ अर्जुनानिलभिन्नानि वनान्यर्जुनविद्विषाम्। चक्रुर्लोहितधाराभिर्धरणी लोहितान्तराम्॥ लोहितेन समायुक्तः पांसुभिः पवनोद्धृतैः। बभूवुर्लोहितास्तत्र भृशमादित्यरश्मयः॥ सार्क खं तत्क्षणेनासीत् संध्यायामिव लोहितम्।<br />The Kurus lost all their energy in fear of Arjuna. Uprooted by Arjuna wind, the trees of the Arjuna's enemies reddened the earth with purple secretions. And with the dust saturated with blood and raised up by the wind the rays of the sun were greatly reddened. The sky with the sun being reddened soon appeared like the evening.</p>
<p id='21'>अप्यस्तं प्राप्य सूर्योऽपि निवर्तेत न पाण्डवः॥ तान सर्वान् समरे शूरः पौरुषे समवस्थितान्। दिव्धरस्त्रैरचिन्त्यात्मा सर्वानाछेद् धनुर्धरान्॥ स तु द्रोणं त्रिसप्तत्या क्षुरप्राणां समार्पयत्। दुःसहं दशभिर्बाणैौणिमष्टाभिरेव च।॥ दुःशासनं द्वादशभिः कृपं शारद्वतं त्रिभिः।<br />Even the sun ceases to pour its rays when he sets but the son of Pandu did not cease to discharge his arrows. In the battle that hero of incomprehensible energy assailed with celestials weapons all the heroic and leading bow men. He discharged seventy arrows, sharp as razors at Drona, Twelve at Dushasana and three at Kirpa, the son of Sharadvata.</p>
<p id='22'>भीष्मं शान्तनवं षष्ट्या राजानं च शतेन ह। कर्णं च कर्णिना कर्णे विव्याध परवीरहा॥<br />That slayer of hostile heroes pierced with six shafts Bhishma, the son of Shantanu and the king Duryodhana with hundred and Karna in the car with a bearded shaft.</p>
<p id='23'>तस्मिन् विद्धे महेष्वासे कर्णे सर्वास्त्रकोविदे। हताश्वसूते विरथे ततोऽनीकमभज्यत॥<br />When that great bowman Karna expert in the use of all weapons, was thus pierced and his steeds, chariot and charioteer destroyed, his army were routed.</p>
<p id='24'>तत् प्रभन्नं बलं दृष्ट्वा पार्थमाजिस्थितं पुनः। अभिप्रायं समाज्ञाय वैराटिरिदमब्रवीत्॥<br />Beholding the army thus routed and with a view to decipher Partha intention the son of Virata addressed Partha in the battle-field saying:</p>
<p id='25'>आस्थाय रुचिरं जिष्णो रथं सारथिना मया। कतमं यास्यसेऽनीकमुक्तो यास्याम्यहं त्वया॥<br />O Partha, stationed on this beautiful car with myself as charioteer, towards what division of the army shall I go?</p>
<p id='26'>अर्जुन उवाच लोहिताश्वमरिष्टं यं वैयाघ्रमनुपश्यसि। नीलां पताकामाश्रित्य रथे तिष्ठन्तमुत्तर॥ कृपस्यैतदनीकाग्न्यं प्राप्यस्वैतदेव माम्। एतस्य दर्शयिष्यामि शीघ्रास्त्रं दृढधन्विनः॥<br />Arjuna said O Uttara, the hero, whom you see before, clad in a coat of tiger-skin, on a car with blue flag drawn by red horses, is Kripa-and there is the van of his army. Do you take me there. I shall show that great bowman my light handedness in the use of weapons.</p>
<p id='27'>ध्वजे कमण्डलुर्यस्य शातकौम्भमयः शुभः। आचार्य एष हि द्रोण: सर्वशस्त्रभृतां वरः॥<br />That hero, on whose flag is the emblem of a beautiful golden water pot, is the preceptor Drona-the foremost of the wielders of all weapons.</p>
<p id='28'>सदा ममैष मान्यस्तु सर्वशस्त्रभृतामपि। सुप्रसन्नं महावीरं कुरुष्वैनं प्रदक्षिणम्॥<br />He is ever worshipful to me as well as to other heroes. Do you cheerfully go round him the foremost of the Kuru warriors.</p>
<p id='29'>अत्रैव वावरोहैनमेष धर्मः सनातनः। यदि मे प्रथमं द्रोणः शरीरे प्रहरिष्यति। ततोऽस्य प्रहरिष्यामि नास्य कोपो भवेदिति॥ अस्याविदूरे हि धनुर्ध्वजाये यस्य दृश्यते!<br />I shall salute him there for such is the ever abiding duty. If Drona at first strikes my body. I shall strike him then and he will not be angry for it. Near him at whose flag the mark of a bow is seen.</p>
<p id='30'>आचार्यस्यैष पुत्रो वै अश्वत्थामा महारथः॥ सदा ममैष मान्यस्तु सर्वशस्त्रभृतामपि।<br />Is the preceptor's son, the mighty carwarrior Ashvathama, who is always worthy of my respect as well as other heroes.</p>

<p id='34'>प्रापयस्वैष राजा हि प्रमाथी युद्धदुर्मदः॥ एष द्रोणस्य शिष्याणां शीघ्रास्त्रे प्रथमो मतः।<br />The king is irrepressible in battle and capable of grinding (enemies); in lightness of hand he is regarded as the foremost amongst the disciples of Drona.</p>
<p id='35'>एतस्य दर्शयिष्यामि शीघ्रास्त्रं विपुलं रणे॥ नागकक्षा तु रुचिरा ध्वजाग्रे यस्य तिष्ठति। एष वैकर्तनः कर्णो विदितः पूर्वमेव ते॥ एतस्य रथमास्थाय राधेयस्य दुरात्मनः।<br />I shall in battle show him my superior light handedness in the discharge of arrows. That warrior, on whose flag is the emblem of a strong rope for binding elephants, is Karna, the son of Vikartana, already known to you.
