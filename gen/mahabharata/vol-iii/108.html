<p id='2'>चरन्तं हसरूपेण महर्षिं संशितव्रतम्। साध्या देवा महाप्राज्ञं पर्यपृच्छन्त वै पुरा॥<br />While the great Rishi of rigid vows was wandering as a mendicant, the deities called Saddhyas, in days of old, asked him of great wisdom.</p>
<p id='3'>साध्या ऊचुः साध्या देवा वयमेते महर्षे दृष्ट्वा भवन्तं न शक्नुमोऽनुमातुम्। श्रुतेन धीरो बुद्धिमांस्त्वं मतो नः काव्यां वाचं वक्तुमर्हस्युदाराम्॥<br />The Saddhyas said We are deities called Saddhyas. O great Rishi, seeing you, we are unable to guess who you are; but it seems to us that you are possessed of self-control and thorough acquaintance with the holy books. It is, therefore, most proper that you should discourse to us in the magnanimous words full of wisdom.</p>
<p id='4'>हंस उवाच एतत् कार्यममराः संश्रुतं मे धृतिः शमः सत्यधर्मानुवृत्तिः। ग्रन्धि विनीय हृदयस्य सर्वं प्रियाप्रिये चात्मसमं नयीत॥<br />The mendicant Rishi said O immortals, it has been heard by me that tranquility, self-control and the observance of true religion practiced until all the knots of one's heart be loosened bring for the agreeable and disagreeable to the level of one's own self.</p>
<p id='5'>आक्रुश्यमानो नाक्रोशेन्मन्युरेव तितिक्षतः आक्रोष्टारं निर्दहति सुकृतं चास्य विन्दति॥<br />The man who is reviling should not be reviled; for, the pain that is felt by him who endures (the reviling) patiently consumes the reviler and draws away and assimilates the effect of his good deeds.</p>
<p id='6'>नाक्रोशी स्यान्नावमानी परस्य मित्रद्रोही नोत नीचोपसेवी। न चाभिमानी न च हीनवृत्तो रुक्षां वाचं रुषती वर्जयीत॥<br />Do not revile others, nor insult them. Do not quarrel with friends, nor associate with the vulgar. Do not be vain, nor of bad manners; and avoid words that are harsh and those that proceed from passion.</p>
<p id='7'>मर्माण्यस्थीनि हृदयं तथासून् रूक्षा वाचो निर्दहन्तीह पुंसाम्। तस्माद् वाचमुषती रूक्षरूपां धर्मारामो नित्यशो वर्जयीत॥<br />Harsh words burn the very vitals, bones, heart and the life of men. Therefore he that has virtue for his refuse should always avoid harsh and angry words.</p>
<p id='8'>अरुन्तुदं परुष रूक्षवाचं वाक्कण्टकैर्वितुदन्तं मनुष्यान्। विद्यादलक्ष्मीकतमं जनानां मुखे निबद्धां निर्ऋतिं वै वहन्तम्॥<br />The luckless man who pierce the hearts of others by thorns of harsh words touching their vitals bears on his face the misery and death of all men.</p>
<p id='9'>भृशं सुतीक्ष्णैरनलार्कदीप्तैः। स विध्यमानोऽप्यतिदह्यमानो विद्यात् कविः सुकृतं मे दधाति॥<br />A wise men pierced by sharp arrows of words from another and blazing like the fire or the sun should, though wounded and burning with extreme pain, bear all with patience, remembering that the effects of the slanderer's good deeds become his own.</p>
