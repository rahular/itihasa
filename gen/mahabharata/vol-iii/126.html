<h3>YANASANDHI PARVA: Chapter 54</h3><h4>The speech of Sanjaya</h4><p id='1'>संजय उवाच एवमेतन्महाराज यथा वदसि भारत। युद्धे विनाशः क्षत्रस्य गाण्डीवेन प्रदृश्यते॥<br />Sanjaya said It is, O great king, as you say, O Bharata. The destruction of the Kshatriya by war with the Gandiva bow seems apparent.</p>
<p id='2'>इदं तु नाभिजानामि तव धीरस्य नित्यशः। यत् पुत्रवशमागच्छेस्तत्त्वज्ञः सव्यसाचिनः॥<br />I do not know how it is that you, who are ever wise and know about the attributes of Savyasachin, allow yourself to be controlled by your sons.</p>
<p id='3'>नैष कालो महाराज तव शश्वत् कृतागसः। त्वया ह्येवादितः पार्था निकृता भरतर्षभ।॥<br />This is not the time, O great king, (to give way to grief); for you have repeatedly wronged them. By you in the beginning were the Parthas cxiled, O bull among the race of Bharata.</p>
<p id='4'>पिता श्रेष्ठः सुहृद् यश्च सम्यक् प्रणिहितात्मवान्। आस्थेयं हि हितं तेन न द्रोग्धा गुरुरुच्यते॥<br />A father is the best friend and he should guide well those who are his own selves. Their welfare should be sought after carefully; but he who overlooks this duty, cannot be called a superior.</p>
<p id='5'>इदं जितमिदं लब्धमिति श्रुत्वा पराजितान्। द्यूतकाले महाराज स्मयसे स्म कुमारवत्॥<br />Hearing of the defeat (at the game), like a boy you laughed out, O great king, saying-"this is gained, this is won”.</p>
<p id='6'>परुषाण्युच्यमानांश्च पुरा पार्थानुपेक्षसे। कृत्स्नं राज्यं जयन्तीति प्रपातं नानुपश्यसि॥<br />Formerly you neglected the Parthas, who were being addressed in hashed words thinking that the kingdom had been acquired (by your sons). You did not then foresee this fall.</p>
<p id='7'>पित्र्यं राज्यं महाराज कुरुवस्ते सजाङ्गलाः। अथ वीरैर्जितामुर्वीमखिलां प्रत्यपद्यथाः॥<br />The country of the Kurus, with Jangala, O great king, is your ancestral kingdom; but you have possessed yourself the entire kingdom subjugated by the heroes.</p>
<p id='8'>बाहुवीर्यार्जिता भूमिस्तव पार्थेनिवेदिता। मयेदं कृतमित्येव मन्यसे राजसत्तम॥<br />The kingdom acquired by their arms and prowess was made over to you by the Parthas and you think, "it has been acquired by me," O best of kings.</p>
<p id='9'>चस्तान् गन्धर्वराजेन मज्जतो ह्यप्लवेऽम्भसि। आनिनाय पुनः पार्थः पुत्रांस्ते राजसत्तम॥<br />Your sons, O best of kings, overpowered by the king of the Gandharvas and thus sinking as it were in a scoreless open, were brought back by Partha.</p>
<p id='10'>कुमारवच्च स्मयसे छूते विनिकृतेषु यत्। पाण्डवेषु वने राजन् प्रव्रजत्सु पुनः पुनः॥<br />Like a boy, too, did you repeatedly laugh at the defeat (of the Pandavas) at dice and also when they were wandering about being exiled.</p>
<p id='11'>प्रवर्षतः शरवातानर्जुनस्य शितान् बहून्। अप्यर्णवा विशुष्येयुः किं पुनर्मांसयोनयः॥<br />At the shower, by Arjuna, of a great many sharp edged arrows, even the oceans dry up, not to speak of those things, that owe their origin to flesh.</p>
<p id='12'>अस्यतां फाल्गुनः श्रेष्ठोगाण्डीवं धनुषां वरम्। केशवः सर्वभूतानामायुधानां सुदर्शनम्॥<br />Among the shooters of arrows, the son of Falguna is the chief, among the bows the Gandiva is the best; Keshava is the chief of all creatures, and the Sudarshana among weapons.</p>
<p id='13'>वानरो रोचमानश्च केतुः केतुमतां वरः। एवमेतानि सरयो वहू वेतहयो रणे॥<br />Of all things having banners the one shining with the banner and having the device of an ape (is the foremost). The car, having all these and having many white horses in battle.</p>
<p id='14'>क्षपयिष्यति नो राजन् कालचक्रमिवोद्यतम्। तस्याद्य वसुधा राजन् निखिला भरतर्षभ॥<br />Will overthrow us, O king, like the uplifted wheel of death. To-day, the entire earth is his, O king, O bull of the race of Bharata.</p>
<p id='15'>यस्य भीमार्जुनौ योधौ स राजा राजसत्तम। तथा भीमहतप्रायां मज्जन्तीं तव वाहिनीम्॥<br />He who has the two warriors, Bhima and Arjuna, on his side, O best of kings is the king seeing your army nearly killed by Bhima.</p>
<p id='16'>दुर्योधनमुखा दृष्ट्वा क्षयं यास्यन्ति कौरवाः। न भीमार्जुनयोर्भीता लप्स्यन्ते विजयं विभो॥<br />The Kauravas, headed by Duryodhana, will be destroyed, struck by the terror of Bhima and Arjuna; and victory will not be gained, O Lord,</p>
<p id='17'>तव पुत्रा महाराज राजानश्चानुसारिणः। मत्स्यास्त्वामद्य नार्चन्ति पञ्चालाश्च सकेकयाः॥ शाल्वेयाः शूरसेनाश्च सर्वे त्वामवजानते। पार्थं ह्येते गताः सर्वे वीर्यज्ञास्तस्य धीमतः।।१८।<br />By your son, O great king or by the kings who are his followers. The king of the Matsyas does not pay you homage now; nor does the Panchala with the Kaikeyas; nor do the Shalvas and the Shurasenas. All disregard you. All of them have gone over to the side of Partha, well knowing the heroism of that wise one.</p>
<p id='18'>भक्त्या ह्यस्य विरुध्यन्ते तव पुत्रैः सदैव ते। अनर्हानेव तु वधे धर्मयुक्तान् विकर्मणा॥ योऽक्लेशयत् पाण्डुपुत्रान् यो विद्वेष्ट्यधुनापि वै। सर्वोपायनियन्तव्यः सानुगः पापपूरुषः॥<br />Out of regard for him, they are ever against your sons. He who troubles the sons of Pandu endued with virtue and undeserving of injury by unworthy actions and he who despises them even now, that evil-minded man, along with his followers, should be checked by all means.</p>
<p id='19'>तव पुत्रो महाराज नानुशोचितुमर्हसि। द्यूतकाले मया चोक्तं विदुरेण च धीमता॥<br />It is not proper, O great king, that you should grieve for your sons. At the time of the game at dice, all this was predicted by me, as also by the wise Vidura.</p>
<p id='20'>यदिदं ते विलपितं पाण्डवान् प्रति भारत। अनीशेनेव राजेन्द्र सर्वमेतन्निरर्थकम्॥<br />All these lamentations of yours for the sons of Pandu, O Bharata, as if you had no hand in the matter, are all useless, O chief among kings.</p>
