<h3>SANJAYAYANA PARVA: Chapter 28</h3><h4>The speech of Yudhishthira</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच असंशयं संजय सत्यमेतद् धर्मो वरः कर्णणां यत् त्वमात्थ। ज्ञात्वा तु मां संजय गर्हयेस्त्वं यदि धर्मं यद्यधर्मं चरेयम्॥<br />Yudhishthira said Undoubtedly, O Sanjaya, it is as you say namely that virtuous acts are the best among deeds; and knowing, O Sanjaya, whether it is Qur virtue or vice that I follow should you blame me.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>यत्राधर्मो धर्मरूपाणि धत्ते धर्मः कृत्स्नो दृश्यतेऽधर्मरूपः। बिभ्रद् धर्मो धर्मरूपं तथा च विद्वांसस्तं सम्प्रपश्यन्ति बुद्ध्या॥<br />Where vice assumes the appearance of virtue and virtue appears completely as vice and virtue appears in its own form wise men should distinguish it from virtue by their intelligence.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>एवं तथैवापदि लिङ्गमेतद् धर्माधर्मी नित्यवृत्ती भजेताम्। मापद्धर्मं संजय तं निबोध॥<br />A man should follow the profession of the order among which he is born, but similarly in tirnes of distress these occupations which are fixed, follow the rule of virtue and vice. Hear now, O Sanjaya, what constitutes profession in times of distress.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>लुप्तायां तु प्रकृतौ येन कर्म निष्पादयेत् तत् परीप्सेद् विहीनः। प्रकृतिस्थश्चादि वर्तमान उभौ गौ भवतः संजयैतौ॥<br />With his means of livelihood gone, a destitute man ought to desire for such means as may enable him to perform such duties as are laid down for him. O Sanjaya; both the man whose means of livelihood is not gone and the one who is in distress, are culpable (if they act as if they are not what they are)O Sanjaya,</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>अविनाशमिच्छतां ब्राह्मणानां प्रायश्चित्तं विहितं यद् विधात्रा। सम्पश्येथाः कर्मसु वर्तमानान् विकर्मस्थान् संजय गर्हयेस्त्वम्॥<br />Since expiation has been prescribed by the creator, for those Brahmanas who without wishing for ruin to themselves (do actions sinful for them to do). With due regard to this fact, O Sanjaya, should you find fault with those whose means of livelihood is gone and those who are not in that position.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>सर्वोत्सङ्गं साधु मनीषिणां सत्त्वविच्छेदनाय विधीयते सत्सु वृत्तिः सदैवा अब्राह्मणाः सन्ति तु ये न वैद्याः मन्येत तेभ्यः॥<br />For the acquirement of the knowledge of our inner self and for bringing the mind under control is always prescribed accepting alms from good men. For those that are not Brahmanas and do not want to know about the inner self, the practices prescribed for their respective orders are considered to be the best.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>तदध्वानः पितरो ये च पूर्वे पितामहा ये च तेभ्यः परेऽन्ये। र्नान्यं ततो नास्तिकोऽस्मीति मन्ये॥<br />That path has been followed by our fathers and grandfathers and also by others and all those who are wise adopt the same path. For this I do not consider that they were not orthodox.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>यत् किंचनेदं वित्तमस्यां पृथिव्यां यद् देवानां त्रिदशानां परं यत्। प्राजापत्यं त्रिदिवं ब्रह्मलोकं नाधर्मतः संजय कामयेयम्॥<br />What little wealth there is in this world, what in the possessions of the gods and what is beyond them or the region of the Prajapatis, the heaven or the region of Brahma. I do not desire even unrighteously, O Sanjaya.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>प्युपासिता ब्राह्मणानां मनीषी। नानाविधांश्चैव महाबलांश्च राजन्यभोजाननुशास्ति कृष्णः॥<br />Krishna, is the lord (as it were) of virtue, well versed in every science, politic, wise and has been attended by Brahmanas and by him are instructed many kings of great prowess.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>यदि ह्यहं विसृजन् साम गर्यो नियुध्यमानो यदि जह्या स्वधर्मम्। महायशाः केशवस्तद् ब्रवीतु वासुदेवस्तूभयोरर्थकामः॥<br />If I am to blame by not making peace and if I swerve from the duties of my order, let Keshava, the son of Vasudeva, of great fame, who desires the welfare of both parties, say.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>शैनेयोऽयं चेदयश्चान्धकाश्च वार्ष्णेयभोजाः कुकुरा: संजयाश्च। उपासीना वासुदेवस्य बुद्धिं निगृह्य शत्रून् सुहृदो नन्दयन्ति॥<br />This Shini and the king of the Chedis and the king of the Andhakas and of the Vrishnis, of the Bhojas, of the Kukuras and of the Srinjayas, all by following the counsels of the son of Vasudeva slay their enemies and thus please their friends.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>वृष्ण्यन्धका एग्रसेनादयो वै कृष्णप्रणीताः सर्व एवेन्द्रकल्पाः। मनस्विनः सत्यपरायणाश्च महाबला यादवा भोगवन्तः॥<br />The kings of Vrishni and Andhaka and Ugrasena and others, led by Krishna, are all the equals of Indra and are spirited, attached to truth, of great prowess and happy.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>काश्यो बर्भुः श्रियमुत्तमां गतो लब्ध्वा कृष्णं भ्रातरमीशितारम्। यस्मै कामान् वर्षति वासुदेवो चीष्मात्यये मेघ इव प्रजाभ्यः॥<br />The king, of Kashi having obtained Krishna, the giver of boons, as his brother, has attained to great prosperity; on him the son of Vasudeva, showers blessings as the cloud on earthly beings at the close of summer.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>ईदृशोऽयं केशवस्तात विद्वान् विद्धि ह्येनं कर्मणां निश्चयज्ञम्। प्रियश्च नः साधुतमश्च कृष्णो नातिक्रामे वचनं केशवस्य॥<br />Such is this learned Keshava. Know him to be aware of the ethics of actions. The good Krishna is moreover our friend and I shall not act against the advice of Keshava.</p>
