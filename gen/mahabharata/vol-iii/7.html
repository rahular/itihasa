The best of men, great in might and beauty, resembling a deity in form, appearing like the sun enveloped with thick clouds, and like the mighty fire covered with ashes, first presented himself before the illustrious king Virata while he was seated in the court.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>तमापतन्तं प्रसमीक्ष्य पाण्डवं विराटराडिन्दुमिवाभ्रसंवृतम्। समागतं पूर्णशशिप्रभाननं महानुभावं न चिरेण दृष्टवान्॥<br />The king Virata first saw the Pandava coming like the moon covered with clouds and then in a moment found him arrived at the court, with a countenance like the full moon and possessed of a great splendour.</p>

<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>न तु द्विजोऽयं भविता नरोत्तमः पतिः पृथिव्या इति मे मनोगतम्। न चास्य दासो न रथो न कुढारः समीपतो भ्राजति चायमिन्द्रवत्॥<br />This best of men can not be a Brahmin; me-thinks he is a lord of earth, though he has neither a slave, nor a car, nor an elephant with him, yet he shines just like Indra.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>शरीरलिङ्गैरूपसूचितो ह्ययं मूर्द्धाभिषिक्त इति मे मनोगतम्। समीपमायाति च मे गतव्यथो यथा गजस्तामरसी मदोत्कटः॥<br />By the marks on his person it is indicated that he is no other than one whose head has gone through the ceremony of coronal baths, and that is my belief. He approaches me as fearless as an elephant in a ruttish frenzy approaches a lotus.”</p>
