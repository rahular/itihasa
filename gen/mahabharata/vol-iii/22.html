<p id='65'>नदन्तं च महानादं भिन्नभेरीसमस्वनम्। भ्रामयामास सुचिरं विस्फुरन्तमचेतसम्॥<br />Then Bhima began to whirl him who was senseless, for a considerable time, and he roared terribly like a discordant bugle.</p>
<p id='66'>प्रगृह्य तरसा दोर्भ्यां कण्ठं तस्य वृकोदरः। अपीडयत कृष्णायास्तदा कोपोपशान्तये॥<br />Then to console Krishna, Vrikodara got hold of Kichaka's throat with his arms and began to squeeze it.</p>
<p id='67'>अथ तं भग्नसर्वाङ्गं व्याविद्धनयनाम्बरम्। आक्रम्य च कटीदेशे जानुना कीचकाधमम्। अपीडयत बाहुभ्यां पशुमारममारयत्॥ तं विषीदन्तमाज्ञाय कीचकं पाण्डुनन्दनः। भूतले भ्रामयामास वाक्यं चेदमुवाच ह॥<br />Then striking with his knees the waist of that wretch of Kichaka, all whose limbs had been broken into pieces and whose eye-lids were closed, that descendant of Pandu killed him like one killing a beast. Then beholding Kichaka senseless,</p>
