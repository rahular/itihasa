<p id='18'>अथ काले पुनर्धीमान् गालवः प्रत्युपस्थितः। उपसंगम्य चोवाच हर्यश्वं प्रीतमानसम्॥<br />In proper time, the wise Galava again presented himself there and having approached Haryashva said to him whose desire had been satisfied.</p>
<p id='19'>जातो नृप सुतस्तेऽयं बालो भास्करसंनिभः। कालो गन्तुं नरश्रेष्ठ भिक्षार्थमपरं नृपम्॥<br />"O ruler of men, you have begotten this son, a boy similar to the sun in effulgence and it is time for me to go another ruler of men to ask for alms."</p>
<p id='20'>हर्यश्वः सत्यवचने स्थितः स्थित्वा च पौरुषे। दुर्लभत्वाद्धयानां च प्रददौ माधवीं पुनः॥<br />Haryashva, who was ever ready to abide by his words and who made manliness the basis of his action, gave back Madhvi as he could not procure all the horses himself.</p>
<p id='21'>माधवी च पुनर्दीप्तां परित्यज्य नृपश्रियम्। कुमारी कामतो भूत्वा गालवं पृष्ठतोऽन्वयात्॥<br />Madhvi, too abandoning that effulgent royal propriety, become a maiden again of her own will and followed Galava.</p>
<p id='22'>त्वय्येव तावत् तिष्ठन्तु हया इत्युक्तवान् द्विजः। प्रययौ कन्यया सार्धं दिवोदासं प्रजेश्वरम्॥<br />"Let the horse remain with you for the present, in company with the maiden, to Divodasa, the ruler of men.</p>
