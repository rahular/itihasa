<h3>BHAGAVAD-YANA PARVA: Chapter 85</h3><h4>The embassy of the God</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच तथा दूतैः समाज्ञाय प्रयान्तं मधुसूदनम्। धृतराष्ट्रोऽब्रवीद् भीष्ममर्चयित्वा महाभुजम्॥ द्रोणं च संजयं चैव विदुरं च महामतिम्। दुर्योधनं सहामात्यं हृष्टरोमाब्रवीदिदम्॥<br />Vaishampayana said In the mean time, having come to know of the departure of the slayer of Madhu (from the Pandava camp) through his spies, Dhritarashtra said to Bhishma of long arms after paying him due honours; and also to Drona and Sanjaya and the greatly intelligent Vidura his hairs standing up and also to Duryodhana and his ministers.</p>
<p id='2'>अद्भुतं महदाश्चर्यं श्रूयते कुरुनन्दन। स्त्रियो बालाश्च वृद्धाश्च कथयन्ति गृहे गृहे॥ सत्कृत्याचक्षते चान्ये तथैवान्ये समागताः। पृथग्वादाश्च वर्तन्ते चत्वरेषु सभासु च॥<br />o descendant of Kuru, I hear a strange thing-an exceedingly one. Women and children and old men are talking about it in every household. Some are discussing the subject out of good motives; while others are doing it, united together or separately; and the discussion is going on within the houses, as also in open spots.</p>

<p id='5'>स मान्यता नरश्रेष्ठः स हि धर्मः सनातनः। पूजितो हि सुखाय स्यादसुखः स्यादपूजितः॥<br />That chief among men ought to be respected by the good; for he is the eternal virtue. For the sake of happiness is he worshipped. If he is not due regard, misery race ensues.</p>
<p id='6'>स चेत् तुष्यति दाशार्ह उपचारैररिंदमः। कृष्णात् सर्वानभिप्रायान् प्राप्स्यामः सर्वराजसु॥<br />If that chastiser of foes of the Dasharha race is satisfied with due reception; them shall we obtain the fulfillment of all our wishes from i Krishna in the midst of all the kings.</p>

<p id='12'>आसनानि विचित्राणि युतानि विविधैर्गुणैः। स्त्रियो गन्धानलंकारान् सूक्ष्माणि वसनानि च॥ गुणवन्त्यन्नपानानि भोज्यानि विविधानि च। माल्यानि च सुगन्धीनि तानि राजा ददौ ततः॥<br />The king then sent there beautiful seats endued with various good qualities, girls, scents ornaments fine cloths, eatables and drinks of excellent qualities, garlands and perfumes of several kinds.</p>
