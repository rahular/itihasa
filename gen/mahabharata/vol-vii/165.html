<h3>APADDHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 165</h3><h4>The distribution of wealth among Brahmanas</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>भीष्म उवाच हृतार्थो यक्ष्यमाणश्व सर्ववेदान्तगश्च यः। आचार्यपितृकार्यार्थं स्वाध्यायार्थमथापि च॥ एते वै दृष्टा ब्राह्मणा धर्मभिक्षवः। निःस्वेभ्यो देयमेतेभ्यो दानं विद्या च भारत॥ साधवो<br />Bhishma said Wealth and knowledge, O Bharata, should be given to such pious and impoverished Brahmanas as have been robbed of their wealth (by thieves), as are engaged in the celebration of sacrifices, as are well-read in all the Vedas, and as are desirous of acquiring the merit of righteousness, so that they may satisfy their duties to preceptors and the Pitris, and spend their days in reciting and studying the scriptures.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>अन्यत्र दक्षिणादानं देयं भरतसत्तम। अन्येभ्योऽपि बहिर्वेदि चाकृतान्नं विधीयते॥ सर्वरत्नानि राजा हि यथार्ह प्रतिपादयेत्।<br />Only the Dakshina, O best of the Bharatas, should be given to those Brahmanas who are not poor. Uncooked food should be given beyond the limits of the sacrificial altar, to those Brahmanas that have fallen away in consequence of their sinful deeds) from their own dignity.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>ब्राह्मणा एव वेदाश्च यज्ञाश्च बहुदक्षिणाः। अन्योन्यं विभवाचारा यजन्ते गुणतः सदा॥<br />The Brahmanas represent the Vedas themselves and all the sacrifices with profuse presents. Desirous of excelling one another, they always celebrate sacrifices, actuated by their various desires. The king should, therefore, make presents of various sorts of valuable wealth to them.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>यस्य त्रैवार्षिकं भक्तं पर्याप्तं भृत्यवृत्तये। अधिकं चापि विद्येत स सोमं पातुमर्हति॥<br />That Brahmana who has sufficient stores for feeding his family for three or more years, deserves to drink the Soma.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>यज्ञश्चेत् प्रतिरुद्धः स्यादंशेनैकेन यज्वनः। ब्राह्मणस्य विशेषेण धार्मिके सति राजनि॥ यो वैश्यः स्याद् बहुपशु-नक्रतुरसोमपः। कुटुम्बात् तस्य तद् वित्तं यज्ञार्थं पार्थिवो हरेत्॥<br />If inspite of the presence of a pious king on the throne, the sacrifice undertaken by any one, but especially by a Brahmana, cannot be completed for want of only a fulptrt of the estimated cost, then the king should, for the completion of that sacrifice, take away from his relatives the wealth of a Vaishya who has a farge flock of cattle but who is averse from sacrifices and abstains from drinking Soma.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>आहरेदथ नो किञ्चत् कामं शूद्रस्य वेश्मनः। न हि यज्ञेषु शूद्रस्य किञ्चिदस्ति परिग्रहः॥<br />The Shudra is not competent to celebrate a sacrifice. The king should, therefore, take away (wealth for such a purpose) from a Shudra's house.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>योऽनाहिताग्निः शतगुरयज्वा च सहस्रगुः। तयोरपि कुटुम्बाभ्यामाहरेदविचारयन्॥<br />The king should, also, unscrupulously take away from their kinsmen the wealth of him who does not celebrate sacrifices although he has a hundred kine, and also of him who does not perform sacrifices although he has a thousand kine.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>अदातृभ्यो हरेद् वित्तं विख्याप्य नृपतिः सदा। तथैवाचरतो धर्मो नृपते: स्यादथाखिलः॥<br />The king should, always, publicly take away the wealth of a person who does not perform charities. By acting in this wise the King acquires great merit.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>तथैव शृणु मे भक्तं भक्तानि षडनश्नतः। अश्वस्तनविधानेन हर्तव्यं हीनकर्मणः॥ खलात् क्षेत्रात् तथा रामाद् यतो वाप्युपपद्यते। आख्यातव्यं नृपस्यैतत् पृच्छतेऽपृच्छतेऽपि वा॥<br />Listen again to me. That Brahmana who has been compelled by want to fast for three days, may take away without permission, according to the rule of a person who cares only for toclay and not for the morrow, only what is necessary for a single mcal, from the husking tub or the field or the garden or any other place of even a degraded man. He should, however, whether asked or unasked, inform the king of his deed.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>न तस्मै धारयेद् दण्डं राजा धर्मेण धर्मवित्। क्षत्रियस्य तु बालिश्या ब्राह्मणः क्लिश्यते क्षुधा॥<br />If the king knows his own duty he should not punish such a Brahmana. He should remember that a Brahmana becomes stricken with hunger only through the fault of the Kshatriya.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>श्रुतशीले समाज्ञाय वृत्तिमस्य प्रकल्पयेत्। अथैनं परिरक्षेत पिता पुत्रमिवौरसम्॥<br />Having learnt a Brahmana's learning and conduct, the king should provide for his living and protect him as a father protects his own begotten son.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>इष्टिं वैश्वानरों नित्यं निर्वयेदब्दपर्यये। अनुकल्पः परो परो धर्मो धर्मवादैस्तु केवलम्॥<br />On the expiry of every year, one should celebrate the Vaishyanara sacrifice. Those who are conversant with religious codes say that the practice of an alternative act, does not destroy virtue.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>विश्वैर्देवैश्च साध्यैश्च ब्राह्मणैश्च महर्षिभिः। आपत्सु मरणाद् भीतैर्विधिः प्रतिनिधीकृतः॥<br />Fearing death in seasons of distress, the Vishvedevas, the Saddhyas, the Brahmanas, and great Rishis, do not hesitate to follow the alternative provisions laid down in the scriptures.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>प्रभुः प्रथमकल्पस्य योऽनुकल्पे न वर्तते। न साम्परायिकं तस्य दुर्मतेर्विद्यते फलम्॥<br />That man, however, who while able to live according to the first provision, as laid down above, follows the alternative, comes to be known as a wicked person and never succeeds in acquiring any happiness in heaven.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>न ब्राह्मणो निवेदेत किंचिद् राजनि वेदवित्। स्ववीर्याद् राजवीर्याच्च स्ववीर्यं बलवत्तरम्॥<br />A Brahmana conversant with the Vedas should mention his power and knowledge to the king. Comparing again the power of a Brahmana with that of the king, the former will always be found to be superior to the latter. never</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>तस्माद् राज्ञः सदा तेजो दुःसहं ब्रह्मवादिनाम्। कर्ता शास्ता विधाता च ब्राह्मणो देव उच्यते॥<br />Therefore the power of the Brahmanas can hardly be borne or resisted by a king. The Brahmana is said to be creator, king, ordainer, and god.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>तस्मिन्नाकुशलं ब्रूयान्न शुष्कामीरयेद् गिरम्। क्षत्रियो बाहुवीर्येण तरेदापदमात्मनः॥<br />No abusive word or dry speeches, should be spoken to a Brahmana. The Kshatriya should get over all his difficulties by the help of the power of his arms.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>धनैवैश्यश्च शूद्रश्च मन्त्रैर्हो मैश्च वै द्विजः। नैव कन्या न युवति मन्त्रज्ञो न बालिशः॥ परिवेष्टाग्निहोत्रस्य भवेन्नासंस्कृतस्तथा। नरकं निपतन्त्येते जुह्वानाः स च यस्य तत्। तस्माद् वैतानकुशलो होता स्याद् वेदपारगः॥<br />The Vaishya and the Shudra should get over their difficulties by riches; the Brahmana should do so by Mantras and Homa. None of these, viz., a maiden, a young woman, a person unacquainted with Mantras, an ignorant person, or one who is impure, is competent to pour libations on the sacrificial fire. If any of these do so he or she is sure to go to hell, with him on whose behalf they act. Therefore none but a Brahmana well-read in the Vedas and skilled in all sacrifices should pour sacrificial libations.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>प्राजापत्यमदत्त्वाश्वमग्न्याधेयस्य दक्षिणाम्। अनाहिताग्निरिति स प्रोच्यते धर्मदर्शिभिः॥<br />They who are well-acquainted with the scriptures hold that man who, having lighted the sacrificial fire, does not give away the dedicated food as Dakshina, is not the kindler of a sacrificial fire,</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>पुण्यानि यानि कुर्वीत श्रद्दधानो जितेन्द्रियः। अनाप्तदक्षिणैर्यज्ञैर्न यजेत कथञ्चन॥<br />A person should, after having controlled his senses, and with proper devotion, do all the meritorious acts. One should never adore gods in sacrifices in which no Dakshina is given.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>प्रजाः पशृंश्च स्वर्गे च हन्ति यज्ञो ह्यदक्षिणः। इन्द्रियाणि यशः कीर्तिमायुश्चाप्यवकृन्तति॥<br />A sacrifice not completed with Dakshina, encompasses the destruction of one's children, animals, and heaven. Such a sacrifice destroys also the senses, the glory the achievements, and the very life, itself.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>उदक्यामासते ये च द्विजाः केचिदनग्नयः। होमं चाश्रोत्रियं येषां ते सर्वे पापकर्मिणः॥<br />Those Brahmanas who know women in their season, or who never celebrate sacrifices, or whose families have no members well-read in the Vedas, are considered as Shudras in act.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>उदपानोदके ग्रामे ब्राह्मणो वृषलीपतिः। उषित्वा द्वादश समाः शूद्रकर्मैव गच्छति॥<br />That Brahmana who, having married a Shudra girl, lives for twelve years continually in a village which has only a well to give water, becomes a Shudra in act.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>अभार्यां शयने बिभ्रच्छूद्रं वृद्ध च वै द्विजः। अब्राह्मणं मन्यमानस्तुणेष्वासीत पृष्ठतः। तथा संशुध्यते राजशृणु चात्र वचो मम॥<br />That Brahmana who brings to his bed a maiden, or allows a Shudra, knowing him as deserving of respect, to sit upon the same carpet with him, should sit on a bed of dry grass behind some Kshatriya or Vaishya and show him respect in that way. It is in this way that he can be purified. Hear, O king, my words on this subject.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>यदेकरात्रेण करोति पापं निकृष्टवर्णं ब्राह्मणः सेवमान:। स्थानासनाभ्यां विहरन् व्रती स त्रिभिर्वर्षेः शमयेदात्मपापम्॥<br />The sin that a Brahmana perpetrates in one night by respectfully serving a member of a lower caste or by playing with him in the same spot or on the same bed, is purified by observing the practice of sitting behind by observing the practice of sitting behind a Kshatriya or a Vaishya on a bed of dry grass for three years continually.</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>न नर्मयुक्तमनृतं हिनस्ति न स्त्रीषु राजन्न विवाहकाले। न गुर्वर्थं नात्मनो जीवितार्थे पञ्चानृतान्याहुरपातकानि॥<br />An untruth spoken for jest is not sinful; nor one spoken at the time of wedding; nor one spoken for doing good to one's preceptor; nor one spoken for saving one's own life. These five sorts of falsehood in speech, it has been said, are not sinful.</p>
<p id='27'><a href='#27'></a>श्रद्दधानः शुभां विद्यां हीनादपि समाप्नुयात्। सुवर्णमपि चामेध्यादाददीताविचारयन्।॥<br />One may gain useful knowledge from even a person of degraded calling, with devotion and reverence. One may take up gold, unhesitatingly from even an unclean spot.</p>
<p id='28'><a href='#28'></a>स्त्रीरत्नं दुष्कुलाच्चापि विषादप्यमृतं पिबेत्। अदृष्या हि स्त्रियो रत्नमाप इत्येव धर्मतः॥<br />A woman who is the ornament of her sex may be married from even a vile race. Nectar, if extracted from poison, may be drunk; women, jewels and other valuables, as also water, can never, according to the scriptural injunction, be impure or unclean.</p>
<p id='29'><a href='#29'></a>गोब्राह्मणहितार्थं च वर्णानां संकरेषु च। वैश्यो गृह्णीत शस्त्राणि परित्राणार्थमात्मनः॥<br />For the good of Brahmanas and kine, and on occasions when mixture of castes takes place, even a Vaishya may take up weapons for his own safety.</p>
<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>सुरापानं ब्रह्महत्या गुरुतल्पमथापि वा। अनिर्देश्यानि मन्यन्ते प्राणान्तमिति धारणा॥<br />Drinking wine, killing a Brahmana, and the violation of the preceptor's bed, are sins when committed consciously, can never be expiated. The only expiation laid down for them is death.</p>
<p id='31'><a href='#31'></a>सुवर्णहरणं स्तैन्यं विप्रस्वं चेति पातकम्। विहरन् मद्यपानाच्च अगम्यागमनादपि॥<br />The sarne may be said of stealing gold, and the theft of a Brahmana's property. By drinking winc, by knowing prohibited women, by mingling with a degraded person, by knowing a Brahmana's woman, one becomes for ever fallen.</p>
<p id='32'><a href='#32'></a>पतितैः सम्प्रयोगाच्च ब्राह्मणीयोनितस्तथा। अचिरेण महाराज पतितो वै भवत्युत॥<br />By associating with a fallen person for one whole year in sacrifices and teaching and sexual intercourse, one becomes fallen. One, however, does not become so by associating with a fallen person in riding on the same car, sitting on the same seat, and eating in the same line.</p>
<p id='33'><a href='#33'></a>संवत्सरेण पतति पतितेन सहाचरन्। याजनाध्यापनाद् यौनान्न तु यानासनाशनात्॥<br />Excluding the five heinous sins that have been mentioned above, all other sins have expiations. Expiating those sins according to the ordinances laid down for them, one should not commit them again.</p>
<p id='34'><a href='#34'></a>एतानि हित्वातोऽन्यानि निर्देश्यानीति भारत। निर्देश्यानेन विधिना कालेनाव्यसनी भवेत्॥ अन्नं वीर्यं ग्रहीतव्यं प्रेतकर्मण्यपातिते। त्रिषु त्वेतेषु पूर्वेषु न कुर्वीत विचारणाम्॥<br />Except all those, O Bharata! Many other sins have been described as removable by penance. Thus he gives up the sinful habit. Regarding those who have been guilty of the first three of these five sins, (namely, drinking wine, killing a Brahmana, and violation of the preceptor's bed), their (surviving) kinsmen have no restrictions about taking food and wearing ornaments, even if their funeral rites remain unperformed when they die. The surviving kinsmen need make no scruple about such things at such times.</p>
<p id='35'><a href='#35'></a>अमात्यान् वा गुरून् वापि जह्याद् धर्मेण धार्मिकः। प्रायश्चित्तमकुर्वाणै तैरर्हति संविदम्॥ अधर्मकारी धर्मेण तपसा हन्ति किल्विषम्। ब्रुवन् स्तेन इति स्तेनं तावत् प्राप्नोति किल्बिषम्॥<br />A virtuous man should, while observing his duties, discard his very friends and elders. In fact, so long as they do not perform expiation, the virtuous should not even talk with those sinners. A man who has committed sins dissipates them by acting virtuously afterwards and by penances. By calling a thief a thief, one conimits the sin of theft.</p>
<p id='36'><a href='#36'></a>अस्तेनं स्तेन इत्युक्त्वा द्विगुणं पापमाप्नुयात्। त्रिभागं ब्रह्महत्यायाः कन्या प्राप्नोति दुष्यती॥ यस्तु दूषयिता तस्याः शेषं प्राप्नोति पाप्मनः।<br />By calling a person thief who, however, is not a thief, one commits a sin just double the sin of theft. The maiden who spoils her virginity incurs three-fourths of the sin of Brahmanicide, while the man who knows her incurs a sin equal to a fourth part of that of Brahmanicide.</p>

<p id='38'><a href='#38'></a>सहस्रं चैव वर्षाणां निपत्य नरकं वसेत्॥ तस्मान्नैवावगर्खेत नैव जातु निपातयेत्।<br />By slaying a Brahmana one undergoes the torments of hell for a thousand years. No one should, therefore, speak ill of a Brahmana or slay him.</p>
<p id='39'><a href='#39'></a>शोणितं यावत: पांसून् संगृह्णीयाद् द्विजक्षतात्॥ तावती: स समा राजन् नरके प्रतिपद्यते।<br />If a man wounds a Brahmana with a weapon, he will have to live in hell for as many years as the grains of dust that are soaked by the blood flowing from the body of the wounded.</p>
<p id='40'><a href='#40'></a>भ्रूणहाऽऽहवमध्ये तु शुद्ध्यते शस्त्रपाततः॥ आत्मानं जुहुयादग्नौ समिद्धे तेन शुद्ध्यते।<br />One guilty of foeticide becomes purified if he dies of wounds received in battle fought for the sake of kine and Brahmanas. He may also be purified by casting his person on a burning fire.</p>

He is purified by his death, brought on by that hot drink, in the other world. A Brahmana stained by such a sin attains regions of felicity by such a course, and such a course only, and not by any other.</p>
<p id='42'><a href='#42'></a>गुरुतल्पमधिष्ठाय दुरात्मा पापचेतनः। स्त्र्याकारां प्रतिमां लिंग्य मृत्युना सोऽभिशुद्ध्यति॥<br />The wicked and sinful wretch who violates the bed of a preceptor, becomes purified by the death that results from embracing a heated iron statue of a female.</p>
<p id='43'><a href='#43'></a>अथवा शिश्नवृषणावादायाञ्जलिना स्वयम्॥ नैर्ऋती दिशमास्थाय निपतेत् स त्वजिह्मगः।<br />Or, emasculating himself and cutting off his organ, and bearing them in his hands, he should go straight way towards the south-west and then give up his ghost.</p>
<p id='44'><a href='#44'></a>ब्राह्मणार्थेऽपि वा प्राणान् संत्यजेत् तेन शुद्ध्यति॥ अश्वमेधेन वापीष्ट्वा अथवा गोसवेन वा। अग्निष्टोमेन वा सम्यगिह प्रेत्य च पूज्यते॥<br />Or, he may cleanse himself of all his sins, by meeting with death for the sake of benefiting a Brahmana. Or, he may regain esteem both in this world and in the next by performing a Horse-sacrifice or a Cowsacrifice or an Agnishtoma.</p>

Even such is the expiation provided for one who skills a woman quick with child, knowing her condition.</p>

A drinker of spirituous liquor should live spare diet, practising Brahmacharya vows, and sleep on the naked earth, and perform, for more than three years the sacrifice next to the Agnishtoma. He should then present a thousand kine with one bull (to a good Brahmana). He would then regain his purily by doing all this.</p>

Having killed a Shudra, one should perform such a sacrifice for one year and present a hundred kine with one bull.

For ravishing any other woman one should undergo similar penances for two years.</p>
<p id='52'><a href='#52'></a>स्थानासनाभ्यां विहरेत् त्रिरह्नाभ्युपयन्नपः। एवमेव निराकर्ता यश्चाग्नीनपविध्यति॥<br />For enjoying oneself in the company of a woman as by sitting with her on the same spot or on the same seat, one should live only on water for three days.

The wicked sinner who does not perform expiatory rite within a year of the perpetration of the sin incurs demerit that is double of what attaches to the original sin.</p>

If a Somadrinking Brahmana smells alcohol from the mouth of one who has drunk it, he should drink warm water for three days or warm milk for the same period. Or, drinking warm water for three days he should live for that period upon air alone. These are the eternal injunctions prescribed for the expiation of sin, especially for a Brahmana who has perpetrated these sins through ignorance and want of judgement.</p>
