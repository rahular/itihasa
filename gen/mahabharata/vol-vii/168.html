<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>तत्र दस्युर्धनयुतः सर्ववर्णविशेषवित्। ब्रह्मण्यः सत्यसंधश्च दाने च निरतोऽभवत्।॥<br />In that village lived a very rich robber conversant with the characteristics of all the castes, devoted to the Brahmanas, firm in truth, and always engaged in making gifts.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>तस्य क्षयमुपागम्य ततो भिक्षामयाचत। प्रतिश्रयं च वासार्थं भिक्षां चैवाथ वार्षिकीम्॥<br />Going to the house of that robber, the Brahmana begged for alms. Indeed, he prayed for a house to live in and the necessaries of life lasting for a year.</p>

<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>बाणवेधे परं यत्नमकरोच्चैव गौतमः। चक्राङ्गान् स च नित्यं वै सर्वतो वनगोचरान्॥ जघान गौतमो राजन् यथा दस्युगणास्तथा। हिंसापटुघृणाहीन: सदा प्राणिवधे रतः॥ गौतमः संनिकर्षेण दस्युभिः समतामियात्।<br />He began to practise with great zeal the art of archery. Every day, like the other robbers living there, Gautama, o king, went into the forest and killed a large number of wild cranes. Always engaged in killing living creatures, he became well-skilled in that act and soon became shorn of mercy. For his intimacy with robbers he became one like one of them.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>तथा तु वसतस्तस्य दस्युग्रामे सुखं तदा॥ अगमन् बहवो मासा निघ्नतः पक्षिणो बहून्।<br />Living happily in that robber village for many months, he killed a number of wild cranes.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>ततः कदाचिदपरो द्विजस्तं देशमागतः॥ जटाचीराजिनधरः स्वाध्यायपरमः शुचिः।<br />One day another Brahmana came to that village. He was clad in rags and deer-skins and bore matted locks on his head. Of highly pure conduct, he was devoted to the study of the Vedas.</p>

<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>तं दस्युग्राममगमद् यत्रासौ गौतमोऽवसत्॥ स तु विप्रगृहान्वेषी शूद्रानपरिवर्जकः।<br />In course of his peregrinations, as already said, the Brahmana came to that robber village where Gautama was living. He never accepted any food if given by a Shudra and, therefore, began to look for the house of a Brahmana there.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>ग्रामे दस्युसमाकीर्णे व्यचरत् सर्वतोदिशम्॥ ततः स गौतमगृहं प्रविवेश द्विजोत्तमः। गौतमश्चापि सम्प्राप्तस्तावन्योन्येन संगतौ॥ चक्राङ्गभारस्कन्धं तं धनुष्पाणिं धृतायुधम्। रुधिरेणावसिक्ताङ्गं गृहद्वारमुपागतम्॥<br />Accordingly he wandered in every direction in that village filled with robber-families. At last that foremost of Brahmanas came to the house of Gautama. It so happened that just then Gautama also, returning from the forest, was entering his house. The two friends met. Armed with bow and sword, he carried on his shoulders a load of killed cranes, and his body was covered with the blood that trickled down from the bag on his shoulders.</p>

You are a Brahmana, and the perpetuator of a Brahmana family. Born in a respectable family belonging to the Middle country, how is it that you have become like a robber in your conduct.</p>

<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>निर्धनोऽस्मि द्विजश्रेष्ठ नापि वेदविदप्यहम्। वित्तार्थमिह सम्प्राप्तं विद्धि मां द्विजसत्तम॥<br />Thus spoken to by that well-meaning friend of his, O king, Gautama answered him in great distress of heart, saying,-O foremost of twiceborn ones, I am poor. I have no knowledge of the Vedas. Know, O best of Brahmanas, that I have taken up my quarters here for the sake of money only.</p>
<p id='31'><a href='#31'></a>त्वदर्शनात् तु विप्रेन्द्र कृतार्थोऽस्म्यद्य वै द्विज। आवां हि सह यास्यावः श्वो वसस्वाद्य शर्वरीम्॥<br />Seeing you, however, I am blessed to-day. We shall together leave this place tomorrow. Do you spend the night here with me.</p>

Though hungry and requested again and again, the guest refused to touch any food in that house.</p>
