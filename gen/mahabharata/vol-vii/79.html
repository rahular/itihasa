<h3>Rajadharmanushasana Parva: Chapter 79</h3><h4>The appointment of sacrificial priests and their duties.</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच क्व समुत्थाः कथंशीला ऋत्विजः स्युः पितामह। कथंविधाश्च राजेन्द्र तद् ब्रूहि वदतां वर॥<br />Yudhishthira said How O grandfather, should persons, employed as priests in our sacrifices, act? What sort of persons should they be, O king? Tell me all this, O foremost of orators.</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच प्रतिकर्म पराचार ऋत्विजां स्म विधीयते। छन्दः सामादि विज्ञाय द्विजानां श्रुतमेव च॥<br />Bhishma said It is laid down for those Brahmanas who are competent to officiate as priests that they should know the Chhandas including the Samans, and all the rites laid down in the Shrutis, and that they should be able to perform all such religious acts as secure the prosperity of the king.</p>
<p id='3'>ये त्वेकरतयो नित्यं धीराश्च प्रियवादिनः। परस्परस्य सुहृदः समन्तात् समदर्शिनः॥<br />They should be devotedly loyal and utter sweet words in addressing kings. They should also be friendly towards one another, and regard all impartially.</p>
<p id='4'>अनृशंसाः सत्यवाक्या अकुसीदा अथर्जवः। अद्रोहोऽनभिमानश्च हीस्तितिक्षा दमः शमः॥ यस्मिन्नेतानि दृश्यन्ते स पुरोहित उच्यते। धीमान् सत्यधृतिर्दान्तो भूतानामविहिंसकः। अकामद्वेषसंयुक्तस्त्रिभिः शुक्लैः समन्वितः॥ अहिंसको ज्ञानतृप्तः स ब्रह्मासनमर्हति। एते महत्विजस्तात सर्वे मान्या यथार्हतः॥<br />They should be shom of cruelty, and truthful. They should never lay out money on interest and should always be simple and sincere. One that is peaceful in temper, shorn of vanity, modest charitable, self-controlled, and contented, intelligent, truthful, observant of vows, and harmless to all creatures, without lust and malice, and endued with the three other excellent qualities, devoid of envy and blessed with knowledge, is worthy of the seat of Brahman himself. Persons possessing such qualities, O sire, are the best of priests and deserve every respect.</p>
<p id='5'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच यदिदं वेदवचनं दक्षिणासु विधीयते। इदं देयमिदं देयं न क्व चिद् व्यवतिष्ठते॥<br />Yudhishthira said There are Vedic texts relating to the gift of Dakshina in sacrifices. There is no ordinance, however, which says that so much should be given.</p>
<p id='6'>नेदं प्रतिधनं शास्त्रमापद्धर्मानुशास्त्रतः। आज्ञा शास्त्रस्य घोरेयं न शक्तिं समवेक्षते॥<br />This ordinance (about the gift of Dakshina) is not the outcome of motives connected with the distribution of wealth. The command of the ordinance, when one cannot give according to the prescription, is terrible. That commandment has altogether neglected the capacity of the sacrificer.</p>
<p id='7'>श्रद्धावता च यष्टव्यमित्येषा वैदिकी श्रुतिः। मिथ्योपेतस्य यज्ञस्य किमु श्रद्धा करिष्यति॥<br />It occurs in the Vedas that a person should with devotion, celebrate a sacrifice. But what can devotion do when the sacrifice is sullied by false substitutes?</p>
<p id='8'>भीष्म उवाच न वेदानां परिभवान्न शान्येन न मायया। कश्चिन्महदवाप्नोति मा तेऽभूद् बुद्धिरीदृशी॥<br />Bhishma said No man gains blessedness or merit by disregarding the Vedas or by deceitor falsehood. Never think that it is otherwise.</p>
<p id='9'>यज्ञाझं दक्षिणा तात वेदानां परिबृंहणम्। न यज्ञा दक्षिणाहीनास्तारयन्ति कथंचन॥<br />Dakshina is one of the limbs of sacrifice and conduces to the nourishment of the Vedas. A sacrifice without Dakshina can never bring on salvation.</p>
<p id='10'>शक्तिस्तु पूर्णपात्रेण सम्मिता न समाभवत्। अवश्यं तात यष्टव्यं त्रिभिर्वर्णर्यथाविधि॥<br />The efficacy, however, of a single Purnapatra is tantamount to that of any Dakshina however rich. Therefore, O sire, every one belonging to the three castes should celebrate sacrifices.</p>
<p id='11'>सोमो राजा ब्राह्मणानामित्येषा वैदिकी स्थितिः। तं च विक्रेतुमिच्छन्ति न वृथा वृत्तिरिष्यते॥<br />The Vedas have settled that Soma is the king of the Brahmanas. Yet they wish to sell it for the sake of celebrating sacrifices, though they never wish to sell it for acquiring a livelihood.</p>
<p id='12'>तेन क्रीतेन यज्ञेन ततो यज्ञः प्रतायते। इत्येवं धर्मतो ध्यातमृषिभिर्धर्मचारिभिः॥<br />Pious Rishis have declared, according to the dictates of morality, that a sacrifice performed with the income of the sale of Soma serves to extend sacrifices.</p>
<p id='13'>पुमान् यज्ञश्च सोमश्च न्यायवृत्तो यदा भवेत्। अन्यायवृत्तः पुरुषो न परस्य न चात्मनः॥<br />These three, viz., a person, a sacrifice, and Soma, must have good character. A person of a bad character neither enjoy this nor the other world.</p>
<p id='14'>शरीरवृत्तमास्थाय इत्येषा श्रूयते श्रुतिः। नातिसम्यक् प्रणीतानि ब्राह्मणानां महात्मनाम्॥<br />We have heard this Shruti that the sacrifice which high-souled Brahmanas perform by wealth acquired by excessive physical labour, does not yield great merit.</p>
<p id='15'>तपो यज्ञादपि श्रेष्ठमित्येषा परमा श्रुतिः। तत् ते वपः प्रवक्ष्यामि विद्वंस्तदपि मे शृणु॥<br />There is an injunction in the Vedas that penances are higher than sacrifices. I shall now describe penances to you. O learned prince listen to me.</p>
<p id='16'>अहिंसा सत्यवचनमानृशंस्यं दमो घृणा एतत् तपो विदुर्धारा न शरीरस्य शोषणम्॥<br />Abstention from injury, truthfulness of speech, benevolence, are considered as penances by the wise and not the emaciation of the body.</p>
<p id='17'>अप्रामाण्यं च वेदानां शास्त्राणां चाभिलङ्घनम्। अव्यवस्था च सर्वत्र तद् वै नाशनमात्मनः।१९।।<br />Disregard of the Vedas, disobedience to the scriptural injunctions and violation of all healthy restraints, bring on self-destruction.</p>
<p id='18'>निबोध देवहोतृणां विधानं पार्थ यादृशम्। चित्तिः स्त्रुक् चित्तमाज्यं च पवित्रं ज्ञानमुत्तमम्॥<br />Listen, O son of Pritha, to what has been laid down by those who pour ten libations upon mercy,-these the fire at ten times of the day.-For them who perform the sacrifice of penance, the Yoga they strive to bring about with Brahma is their ladle the heart is their clarified butter and high knowledge is their Pavitra (a couple of Kusha blades for pouring clarified butter).</p>
<p id='19'>सर्वं जिह्यं मृत्युपदमार्जवं ब्रह्मणः पदम्। एतावाज्ञानविषयः किं प्रलापः करिष्यति॥<br />All sorts of crookedness mean death and all sorts of sincerity are called Brahma. This is the subject of knowledge. The verses of philosophers cannot affect this.</p>
