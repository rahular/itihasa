<h3>Rajadharmanushasana Parva: Chapter 6O</h3><h4>The duties of the four orders described.</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच ततः पुनः स गाङ्गेयमभिवाद्य पितामहम्। प्राञ्जलिर्नियतो भूत्वा पर्यपृच्छयुधिष्ठिरः॥ के धर्माः सर्ववर्णान्नां चातुर्वर्ण्यस्य के पृथक्। चातुर्वाश्रमाणां च राजधर्माश्च के मताः॥<br />Vaishampayana said After this Yudhishthira, saluted his grand father, the son of Ganga, and with joined hands and rapt attention, once more asked him, saying,-'What are the general duties of the four castes and what the especial duties of each. What mode of life should be adopted by which order and what duties are especially designated as the duties of kings.</p>
<p id='2'>केन वै वर्धते राष्ट्र राजा केन विवर्धते। केन पौराश्च भृत्याश्च वर्धन्ते भरतर्षभ॥<br />By what means does a kingdom prosper and what are the means by which the king himself prospers? How also, O foremost of Bharata's race, do the citizens and the servants of the king prosper?</p>
<p id='3'>कोशं दण्डं च दुर्गं च सहायान मन्त्रिणस्तथा। ऋत्विक्पुरोहिताचार्यान् कीदृशान् वर्जयेन्नृपः॥<br />What sorts of wealth, punishments, forts, allies, counsellors, priests and preceptors, should a king avoid?</p>
<p id='4'>केषु विश्वसितव्यं स्याद् राज्ञा कस्याञ्चिदापदि। कुतो वाऽऽत्मा दृढं रक्ष्यस्तन्मे ब्रूहि पितामह॥<br />Whom should the king trust in what sorts of distress and danger? What evils should the king avoid? Tell me all this, O grandfather.</p>
<p id='5'>भीष्म उवाच नमो धर्माय महते नमः कृष्णाय वेधसे। ब्राह्मणेभ्यो नमस्कृत्य धर्मान् वक्ष्यामि शाश्वतान्॥<br />Bhishma said I salute Dharma who is great and Krishna who is Brahma. Having saluted also the Brahmanas (assembled here) I shall describe the eternal duties.</p>
<p id='6'>अक्रोधः सत्यवचनं संविभागः क्षमा तथा। प्रजनः स्वेषु दारेषु शौचमद्रोह एव च॥ आर्जवं भृत्यभरणं नवैते सार्ववर्णिकाः।<br />The control of anger, truthfulness of speech, justice, forgiveness, begetting children upon one's own married wives, purity of conduct, avoidance of quarrel, simplicity, and maintenance of dependents,—these are the nine duties which all the four orders should follow.</p>
<p id='7'>ब्राह्मणस्य तु यो धर्मस्तं ते वक्ष्यामि केवलम्॥ दममेव महाराज धर्मबाहुः पुरातनम्। स्वाध्यायाभ्यसनं चैव तत्र कर्म समाप्यते॥<br />I shall now describe the duties which the Brahmanas should exclusively follow. Selfcontrol, o king, has been declared to be the first duty of Brahmanas. Study of the Vedas, and patient practice of austerities, (are also their other duties). By practising these two, all their acts are done.</p>
<p id='8'>तं चेद् द्विजमुपागच्छेद् वर्तमानं स्वकर्मणि। अकुर्वाणं विक्रर्माणि शान्तं प्रज्ञानतर्पितम्॥ कुर्वीतापत्यसंतानमथो दद्याद् यजेत च। संविभज्य च भोक्तव्यं धनं सद्भिरितीर्यते॥<br />If while engaged in the observance of his own duties, without doing any unfair act, riches comes to a peaceful Brahmana endued with knowledge, he should then marry and seek to beget children, and should also practise charity and celebrate sacrifices. It has been declared by the wise that wealth thus acquired should be enjoyed by distributing it among worthy persons and relatives.</p>
<p id='9'>परिनिष्ठितकार्यस्तु स्वाध्यायेनैव ब्राह्मणः। कुर्यादन्यन्न वा कुर्या-मैत्रो ब्राह्मण उच्यते॥<br />By his study of the Vedas all the pious acts are done. Whether he does or does not acquire anything else, if he only studies the Vedas, he becomes known as a Brahmana or the friend of all creatures.</p>
<p id='10'>क्षत्रियस्यापि यो धर्मस्तं ते वक्ष्यामि भारत। दद्याद् राजन् न याचेत यजेत न च याजयेत्॥<br />I shall also tell you, O Bharata, what the duties of a Kshatriya are. A Kshatriya, O king, should give but not beg, should himself celebrate sacrifices but not officiate as a priest in the sacrifices of others.</p>
<p id='11'>नाध्यापयेदधीयीत प्रजाश्च परिपालयेत्। नित्योद्युक्तो दस्युवधे रणे कुर्यात् पराक्रमम्॥<br />He should never teach the Veda but study the same with a Brahmana teacher. He should protect the people. Always trying his best for the destruction of robbers and wicked people, he should display his prowess in battle.</p>
<p id='12'>ये तु ऋतुभिरीजानाः श्रुतवन्तश्च भूमिपाः। य एवाहवजेतारस्त एषां लोकजित्तमाः॥<br />Those among Kshatriya kings who celebrate great sacrifices, who have a knowledge of the Vedas and who gain victories in battle, become foremost of those who acquire many blessed regions hereafter by their merit.</p>
<p id='13'>अविक्षतेन देहेन सपराद् यो निवर्तते। क्षत्रियो नास्य तत् कर्म प्रशंसन्ति पुराविदः॥<br />Persons well read in the scriptures do not speak highly of a Kshatriya who returns unscathed from battle.</p>
<p id='14'>एवं हि क्षत्रबन्धूनां मार्गमाहुः प्रधानतः। नास्य कृत्यतमं किंचिदन्यद् दस्युनिबर्हणात्॥<br />This is the conduct of a wretched Kshatriya. There is no greater duty for him than the suppression of robbers.</p>
<p id='15'>एवं हि क्षत्रबन्धूनां मार्गमाहुः प्रधानतः। तस्माद् राज्ञा विशेषेण योद्धव्यं धर्ममीप्सता।।१८<br />Gifts, study, and sacrifices, yield prosperity to kings. Therefore, a king who desires to obtain religious merit should engage in battle.</p>
<p id='16'>स्वेषु धर्मेष्ववस्थाप्य प्रजाः सर्वा महीपतिः। धर्मेण सर्वकृत्यानि शमनिष्ठानि कारयेत्॥<br />Compelling all his subjects to follow their respective duties, a king should make all of them do everything according to the dictates of righteousness.</p>
<p id='17'>दानमध्ययनं यज्ञो राज्ञां क्षेमो विधीयते। कुर्यादन्यन्न वा कुर्यादैन्द्रो राजन्य उच्यते॥<br />Whether he does or does not do anything else, if only he protects his subjects, he is considered to accomplish all religious acts and is called a Kshatriya and the foremost of men,</p>
<p id='18'>वैश्यस्यापि हि यो धर्मस्तं ते वक्ष्यामि शाश्वतम्। दानमध्ययनं यज्ञः शौचेन धनसंचयः॥<br />I shall now tell you, O Yudhishthira, what the eternal duties of the Vaishyas are.-A Vaishya should make gifts, study the Vedas, celebrate sacrifices, and acquire wealth by fair means.</p>
<p id='19'>तद् भवेदन्यत् कर्म पितृवत् पालयेद् वैश्यो युक्तः सर्वान् पशूनिह। विकर्म यत् स समाचरेत्॥<br />With proper care he should also take care of and rear up all domestic animals as a father looking after his sons. Anything else that he will do, will be considered as improper for him.</p>
<p id='20'>रक्षया स हि तेषां वै महत् सुखमवाप्नुयात्। प्रजापतिर्हि वैश्याय सृष्ट्वा परिददौ पशून्॥<br />By looking after the (domestic) animals he would secure great happiness. Having created the (domestic) animals, the Creator, assigned their care to the Vaishyas.</p>
<p id='21'>ब्राह्मणाय च राज्ञे च सर्वाः परिददे प्रजाः। तस्य वृत्तिं प्रवक्ष्यामि यच्च तस्योपजीवनम्॥<br />To the Brahmana and the Kshatriya he assigned (the protection of) all creatures. I shall tell you what the Vaishya's profession is and how he is to earn the means of his maintenance.</p>
<p id='22'>षण्णामेकां पिबेद् धेनुं शताच्च मिथुनं हरेत्। लब्धाच्च सप्तमं भागं तथा शृङ्गे कलां खुरे।।२५। सस्यानां सर्वबीजानामेषा सांवत्सरी भृतिः।<br />If he keeps (for others) six kine, he may take the milk of one cow as his own remuneration; and if he keeps (for others) a hundred kine, he may take a pair as his remuneration. If he trades with other's money, he may take a seventh part of the profits, as his share. A seventh part of the profits arising from the trade in horns is also his, but he should take a sixteenth if the trade is in hoofs. If he makes cultivation with seeds given by others, he may take a seventh part of the produce. This should be his annual remuneration.</p>
<p id='23'>न च वैश्यस्य कामः स्यान्न रक्षेयं पशूनिति॥ वैश्ये चेच्छति नान्येन रक्षितव्याः कथंचन।<br />A Vaishya should never wish that he should not tend cattle. If a Vaishya desires to tend cattle no one else should undertake that task.</p>
<p id='24'>शूद्रस्यापि हि यो धर्मस्तं ते वक्ष्यामि भारत॥ प्रजापतिर्हि वर्णानां दासं शूद्रमकल्पयत्।<br />I should tell you, O Bharata, what the duties of a Shudra are. The Creator intended the Shudra as the servant of the other three castes.</p>
<p id='25'>तस्माच्छूद्रस्य वर्णानां परिचर्या विधीयते॥ तेषां शुश्रूषणाच्चैव महत् सुखमवाप्नुयात्।<br />Therefore, the service of the three other classes is the duty of the Shudra. By thus serving the other three, a Shudra may acquire great happiness.</p>
<p id='26'>शूद्र एतान् परिचरेत् त्रीन् वर्णाननुपूर्वशः॥ संचयांश्च न कुर्वीत जातु शूद्रः कथंचन। पापीयान् हि धनं लब्ध्वा वशे कुर्याद् गरीयसः॥ राज्ञा वा समनुज्ञातः कामं कुर्वीत धार्मिकः।<br />He should serve the three other classes according to their order of seniority. A Shudra should never amass riches, lest by them, he makes the members of the three superior orders obedient to him. By this he would incur sin. With the king's permission, however, a Shudra, for religious observances, may acquire wealth.</p>
<p id='27'>तस्य वृत्तिं प्रवक्ष्यामि यच्च तस्योपजीवनम्॥ अवश्यं भरणीयो हि वर्णानां शूद्र उच्यते।<br />I shall now describe the profession, he should pursue and the means by which he may earn his subsistence. It is said that the Shudras should be maintained by the three other castes.</p>
<p id='28'>छत्रं वेष्टनमौशीरमुपानद् व्यजनानि च॥ यातयामानि देयानि शूद्राय परिचारिणे।<br />Used umbrellas, hed-gears, beds, seats, shoes and fans, should be given to the Shudra servants.</p>
<p id='29'>अधार्याणि विशीर्णानि वसनानि द्विजातिभिः॥ शूद्रायैव प्रदेयानि तस्य धर्मधनं हि तत्।<br />Torn clothes, which are no longer fit for wear, should be given by the upper three castes to the Shudra. These are the latter's rightful acquisitions.</p>
<p id='30'>यं च कञ्चिद् द्विजातीनां शूद्रः शुश्रूषुराव्रजेत्॥ कल्प्यां तेन तु ते प्राहुर्वृत्तिं धर्मविदो जनाः।<br />Men, well read in the science of duties, hold that if the Shudra approaches anyone belonging to the three twice-born orders for doing menial service, the latter should give him proper work.</p>
<p id='31'>देयः पिण्डोऽनपत्याय भर्तव्यौ वृद्धदुर्बलौ॥ शूद्रेण तु न हातव्यो भर्ता कस्याञ्चिदापदि।<br />The master should offer the funeral cake to the sonless Shudra servant. The weak and the old amongst them should be maintained. The Shudra should never leave his master whatever may be the miseries he may suffer from.</p>
<p id='32'>अतिरेकेण भर्तव्यो भर्ता द्रव्यपरिक्षये॥ न हि स्वमस्ति शूद्रस्य भर्तृहार्येधनो हि सः।<br />If the master loses his wealth, he should with greatest care be maintained by the Shudra servant. A Shudra cannot enjoy wealth even if it be his own. Whatever he possesses belongs lawfully to his master.</p>
<p id='33'>उक्तस्त्रयाणां वर्णानां यज्ञस्तस्य च भारत। स्वाहाकारवषट्कारौ मन्त्रः शूद्रे न विद्यते॥<br />Sacrifice has been laid down as a duty of the three other castes, it has been laid down for the Shudra also, O Bharata, but he is not competent to utter svaha and svadha or any other Vedic mantra.</p>
<p id='34'>तस्माच्छूद्रः पाकयज्ञैर्यजेताव्रतवान् स्वयम्। पूर्णपात्रमयीमाहुः पाकयज्ञस्य दक्षिणाम्॥<br />Therefore the Shudra, without observing the vows laid down in the Vedas, should adore the gods in minor sacrifices, called Pakayajnas. The gift called Purnapatra is known as the Dakshina of such sacrifices,</p>
<p id='35'>शूद्रः पैजवनो नाम सहस्राणां शतं ददौ। ऐन्द्राग्नेन विधानेन दक्षिणामितिः नः श्रुतम्॥<br />We have heard that in days of yore a Shudra of the name of Paijavana gave Dakshina (in one of his sacrifices) consisting of a hundred thousand Purnapatras, according to the ordinance called Aindragni, (i.e., a hundred thousand animals).</p>
<p id='36'>यतो हि सर्ववर्णानां यज्ञस्तस्यैव भारत। अग्रे सर्वेषु यज्ञेषु श्रद्धायज्ञो विधीयते॥<br />Sacrifice, O Bharata, has been as much sanctioned for the Shudra as for the three other orders. Of all sacrifices, devotion has been laid down to be the foremost.</p>
<p id='37'>दैवतं हि महच्छ्रद्धा पवित्रं यजतां च यत्। दैवतं हि परं विप्राः स्वेन स्वेन परस्परम्॥<br />Devotion is a great god. It purifies all sacrificers. Then again Brahmanas are foremost of gods to their respective Shudra servants.</p>
<p id='38'>अयजनिह सत्रैस्ते तैस्तैः कामैः समाहिताः। संसृष्टा ब्राह्मणैरेव त्रिषु वर्णेषु सृष्टयः॥<br />They adore the gods in sacrifices, for obtaining the fruits of various wishes. The members of the three other orders have all originated from the Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='39'>देवानामपि ये देवा यद् ब्रूयस्ते परं हितम्। तस्माद् वर्णैः सर्वयज्ञाः संसृज्यन्ते न काम्यया॥<br />The Brahmanas are the gods of the very gods. Whatever they would say would be for your great good. Therefore all kinds of sacrifices naturally belong to all the four orders. The celebration of these sacrifices is obligatory and not optional.</p>
<p id='40'>ऋग्जयुः सामवित् पूज्यो नित्यं स्याद् देववद् द्विजः। अनृग्यजुरसामा च प्राजापत्य उपद्रवः।<br />The Brahmana, who is conversant with Richs, Yajus, and Samans, should always be adored as a god. The Shudra, who is without Richs and Yajus and Samans, has Prajapati for his god.</p>
<p id='41'>यज्ञो मनीषया तात सर्ववर्णेषु भारत॥ नास्य यज्ञकृतो देवा ईहन्ते नेतरे जनाः। ततः सर्वेषु वर्णेषु श्रद्धायज्ञो विधीयते॥<br />Mental sacrifice, O sire, is sanctioned for all the orders, O Bharata. It is not true that the gods and other persons do not express a desire to share the offerings in such sacrifices ofs even the Shudra. For this reason, the sacrifice of devotion is laid down for all the castes.</p>
<p id='42'>स्वं दैवतं ब्राह्मणः स्वेन नित्यं परान्वर्णानयजन्नैवमासीत्। अधरो वितान: संसृष्टो वैश्यो ब्राह्मणस्त्रिषु वर्णेषु यज्ञसृष्टः॥<br />The Brahmana is the foremost of gods. It is not true that they that belong to that order do not celebrate the sacrifices of the other orders. The fire called Vitana, though procured from Vaishyas and inspired with mantras, is stili inferior. The Brahmana can celebrate the sacrifices of the three other castes.</p>
<p id='43'>तस्माद्वर्णा ऋजवो ज्ञातिवर्णाः संसृज्यन्ते तस्य विकार एव। एकं साम यजुरेकमृगेका विप्रश्चैको निश्चये तेषु सृष्टः॥<br />Therefore, all the four castes are holy. All the castes are allied to one another by blood through the intermediate classes. They have all originated from Brahmanas. In ascertaining (the priority of origin) it will be seen that amongst all the cases the Brahmana was created first. Originally Saman was one; Yajus was one, and Rich was one.</p>
<p id='44'>अत्र गाथा यज्ञगीताः कीर्तयन्ति पुराविदः। वैखानसानां राजेन्द्र मुनीनां यशुमिच्छताम्॥<br />Regarding it, persons, conversant with ancient histories, cite a verse, O king, sung in praise of sacrifice by the Vaikhanasa Munis on the occasion of performing a sacrifice of theirs.</p>
<p id='45'>उदितेऽनुदिते वापि श्रद्दधानो जितेन्द्रियः। वहिं जुहोति धर्मेण श्रद्धा वै कारणं महत्॥<br />Before or after sun rise, a person of controlled senses, with heart filled with devotion poured libations on the (sacrificial) fire according to the Vedic prescription. Devotion is a powerful agent.</p>
<p id='46'>यत् स्कन्नमस्य तत् पूर्वं यदस्कन्नं तदुत्तरम्। बहूनि यज्ञरूपाणि नानाकर्मफलानि च॥<br />Respecting homas again, that variety which is called skanna is the first one, while that which is called askanna is the last though the most important. Sacrifices are many, their rites and fruits again are many.</p>
<p id='47'>तानि यः सम्प्रजानाति ज्ञाननिश्चयनिश्चितः। द्विजातिः श्रद्धयोपेतः स यशुं पुरुषोऽर्हति॥<br />That Brahmana, possessed of devotion who, gifted with scriptural learning, knows all the rites, is competent to celebrate sacrifices.</p>
<p id='48'>स्तेनो वा यदि वा पापो यदि वा पापकृत्तमः। यशुमिच्छति यज्ञं यः साधुमेव वदन्ति तम्॥<br />That person who desires to celebrate a sacrifice is regarded as righteous even if he happens to be a thief, a sinner or the worst of sinners.</p>
<p id='49'>ऋषयस्तं प्रशंसन्ति साधु चैतदसंशयम्। सर्वथा सर्वदा वर्णैर्यष्टव्यमिति निर्णयः॥<br />The Rishis speak highly of such a man. Forsooth they are right. This then is the conclusion that all the castes should always and by every means in their power celebrate sacrifices.</p>
<p id='50'>न हि यज्ञसमं किञ्चित् त्रिषु लोकेषु विद्यते। तस्माद् यष्टव्यमित्याहुः पुरुषेणानसूयता। श्रद्धापवित्रमाश्रित्य यथाशक्ति यथेच्छया।॥<br />There is nothing in the three worlds equal to sacrifice. Therefore, it has been said that every one,-with heart shorn of malice, should celebrate sacrifices, helped by devotion which is sacred to the best of his ability and as he pleases.</p>
<p id='51'>न हि यज्ञसमं किञ्चित् त्रिषु लोकेषु विद्यते। तस्माद् यष्टव्यमित्याहुः पुरुषेणानसूयता। श्रद्धापवित्रमाश्रित्य यथाशक्ति यथेच्छया।॥<br />There is nothing in the three worlds equal to sacrifice. Therefore, it has been said that every one,-with heart shorn of malice, should celebrate sacrifices, helped by devotion which is sacred to the best of his ability and as he pleases.</p>
