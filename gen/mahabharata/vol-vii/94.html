<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 94</h3><h4>The same subject</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच अयुद्धेनैव विजयं वर्धयेद् वसुधाधिपः। जघन्यमाहुर्विजयं युद्धेन च नराधिप॥<br />Yudhishthira said The king should acquire victories without battles. Victories won by battles are not spoken of highly, O king, by the wise.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>न चाप्यलब्धं लिप्सेत मूले नातिदृढे सति। न हि दुर्बलमूलस्य राज्ञो लाभो विधीयते॥<br />When the sovereign's own power has not been consolidated, he should not try to make new acquisitions. It is not proper that a king whose power has not been confirmed should try to make such acquisitions.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>यस्य स्फीतो जनपदः सम्पन्नः प्रियराजकः। संतुष्टपुष्टसचिवो दृढमूलः स पार्थिवः॥<br />The power of that king whose territories are vast and contain immense wealth, whose subjects are loyal and contented, and who has a large number of officers, is said to be confirmed.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>यस्य योधाः सुसंतुष्टाः सान्त्विताः सूपधास्थिताः। अल्पेनापि स दण्डेन महीं जयति पार्थिवः॥<br />That king whose soldiers are contented, gratified and competent to impose on foes, can, with even a small force, subjugate the whole Earth.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>पौरजानपदा यस्य भूतेषु च दयालवः। सधना धान्यवन्तश्च दृढमूलः स पार्थिवः॥<br />The power of that king, whose subjects whether living in the cities or the provinces, have mercy for all creatures, and posses wealth and gain, is said to be confirmed.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>प्रतापकालमधिकं यदा मन्येत चात्मनः। तदा लिप्सेत मेधावी परभूमिधनान्युत॥<br />When the king thinks that his power is greater than that of an enemy, he should then, helped by his intelligence, seek to acquire the latter's territories and wealth.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>भोगेषूदयमानस्य भूतेषु च दयावतः। वर्धते त्वरमाणस्य विषयो रक्षितात्मनः॥<br />A king, whose resources are increasing, who is compassionate to all creatures, who never loses time by idleness, and who is careful in protecting his own self, succeeds in advancing himself.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>तक्षेदात्मानमेवं स वनं परशुना यथा। यः सम्यग् वर्तमानेषु स्वेषु मिथ्या प्रवर्तते॥<br />That king, who treats deceitfully his own people that have not been guilty of any fault, cuts his own self like a person cutting down a forest with an axe.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>नैव द्विषन्तो हीयन्ते राज्ञो नित्यमनिघ्नतः। क्रोधं निहन्तुं यो वेद तस्य द्वेष्टा न विद्यते॥<br />If the king does not always attend to the task of killing his enemies, the latter do not diminish. That king, again, who knows to destroy his own anger, finds no enemies.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>यदार्यजनविद्विष्टं कर्म तन्नाचरेद् बुधः। यत् कल्याणमभिध्यायेत् तत्रात्मानं नियोजयेत्॥<br />If the king be wise, he would never do any act that is disapproved by good men. He would, however, always perform such acts as would do him and others good.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>नैनमन्येऽवजानन्ति नात्मना परितप्यते। कृत्यशेषेण यो राजा सुखान्यनुबुभूषति॥<br />That king, who, having performed all his duties, becomes satisfied with the verdict of his own conscience, has never to incur the displeasure of others nor has he any occasion to indulge in regrets.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>इदं वृत्तं मनुष्येषु वर्तते यो महीपतिः। उभौ लोकौ विनिर्जित्य विजये सम्प्रतिष्ठते॥<br />That king, who deals with men in such a way, succeeds in subjugating both the worlds and enjoy the fruits of victory.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>भीष्म उवाच इत्युक्तो वामदेवेन सर्वं तत् कृतवान् नृपः। तथा कुर्वंस्त्वमप्येतौ लोको जेता न संशयः॥<br />Bhishma said Thus accosted by Vamadeva, king Vasumanas did as he was directed. Forsooth, following these counsels, you will succeed in conquering both the worlds.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>भीष्म उवाच इत्युक्तो वामदेवेन सर्वं तत् कृतवान् नृपः। तथा कुर्वंस्त्वमप्येतौ लोको जेता न संशयः॥<br />Bhishma said Thus accosted by Vamadeva, king Vasumanas did as he was directed. Forsooth, following these counsels, you will succeed in conquering both the worlds.</p>
