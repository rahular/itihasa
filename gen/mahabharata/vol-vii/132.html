<h3>APADDHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 132</h3><h4>When robbers attack a kingdom how should a Brahman maintain his own people</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच हीने परमके धर्म सर्वलोकाभिसंहिते। सर्वस्मिन् दस्युसाद्भूते पृथिव्यामुपजीवने॥ केन स्विद् ब्राह्मणो जीवेज्जघन्ये काल आगते। असंत्यजन् पुत्रपौत्राननुक्रोशात् पितामह॥<br />Yudhishthira said When virtuous practices calculated to be beneficial the worlds, disappear, when all the means and resources for subsistence fall into the hands of robbers, when such a calamitous time appears, by what means should a Brahmana, O grandfather, who from affection cannot leave his sons and grandsons maintain himself?</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच विज्ञानबलमास्थाय जीवितव्यं तथागते। सर्वं साध्वर्थमेवेदमसाध्वर्थं न किंचन॥<br />Bhishma said When such a time appears the Brahmana should live by the help of knowledge. Everything in this world is for the good. Nothing here is for the wicked.</p>
<p id='3'>असाधुभ्योऽर्थमादाय साधुभ्यो यः प्रयच्छति। आत्मानं संक्रमं कृत्वा कृच्छ्रधर्मविदेव सः॥<br />He, who, himself being an instrument of acquisition, takes wealth from the wicked and gives it to the good, is said to be conversant with the virtue of adversity.</p>
<p id='4'>आकाङ्क्षन्नात्मनो राज्यं राज्ये स्थितिमकोपयन्। अदत्तमेवाददीत दातुर्वित्तं ममेति च॥<br />Desirous of preserving his rule, the king, O monarch, without making his subjects indignant and rebellious may take what is not given to him by the owner, of his own accord, saying,-This is mine.</p>
<p id='5'>विज्ञानबलपूतो यो वर्तते निन्दितेष्वपि। वृत्तिविज्ञानवान् धीरः कस्तं वा वक्तुमर्हति॥<br />That wise man, who, purified by the possession of knowledge, power and righteous conduct at other times, acts censurably in such times, does not really deserve to be blamed.</p>
<p id='6'>येषां बलकृता वृत्तिस्तेषामन्या न रोचते। तेजभासिप्रवर्तन्ते बलवन्तो युधिष्ठिर।॥<br />They, who always support themselves by displaying their power, never prefer any other mode of living. The powerful, O Yudhishthira, always live by the help of prowess.</p>
<p id='7'>यदैव प्राकृतं शास्त्रमविशेषेण वर्तते। तदैवमभ्यसेदेवं मेधावी वाप्यथोत्तरम्॥<br />The ordinary injunctions of the scriptures, without exceptions of any kind, should be followed by a king at such times, while following those scriptures, an intelligent king would do something more.</p>
<p id='8'>ऋत्विकपुरोहिताचार्यान् सत्कृतानभिसत्कृतान्। न ब्राह्मणान् घातयीत दोषान् प्राप्नोति घातयन्॥<br />At such times, however, the king should not oppress Ritwijas, Purohitas preceptors and Brahmanas, all of whom are respected and held in high esteem. By oppressing them, even at such times, he incurs blame and sin.</p>
<p id='9'>एतत् प्रमाणं लोकस्य चक्षुरेतत् सनातनम्। तत् प्रमाणोऽवगाहेत तेन तत् साध्वसाधु वा॥<br />This is considered as an authority in the world. Indeed, this is the eternal eye. One should be guided by this authority. This determines whether a king is to be called good or wicked.</p>
<p id='10'>बहवो ग्रामवास्तव्या रोषाद् ब्रूयुः परस्परम्। न तेषां वचनाद् राजा सत्कुर्याद् घातयीत वा॥<br />It is seen that moved by jealousy and anger many persons, living in villages and towns, vilify one another. The king should never, as said by them, honour or punish any body.</p>
<p id='11'>न वाच्यः परिवादोऽयं न श्रोतव्यः कथञ्चन। कर्णावथ पिधातव्यौ प्रस्थेयं चान्यतो भवेत्॥<br />Slander should never be circulated. If spoken, it should never be heard. When any slanderous conversation goes on, one should close one's ears or leave the place immediately.</p>
<p id='12'>असतां शीलमेतद् वै परिवादोऽथ पैशुनम्। गुणानामेव वक्तारः सन्तः सत्सु नराधिप॥<br />Slanderous conversation becomes only wicked men. It is assign of depravity. They, on the cther hand, O king, who mention the virtues of others in assemblies of the god, are good men.</p>
<p id='13'>यथा सुमधुरौ दम्यौ सुदान्तौ साधुवाहिनौ। धुरमुद्यम्य वहतस्तथा वर्ते: वै नृपः॥<br />As a pair of good-tempered bulls, governable and well-trained to bear loads, put their necks to the yoke and drag the cart willingly, so should the king bear his burden in times of difficulty.</p>
<p id='14'>यथा यथास्य बहवः सहायाः स्युस्तथा परे। आचारमेव मन्यन्ते गरीयो धर्मलक्षणम्॥<br />Others say that a king should behave in such a way that he may succeed in acquiring a large number of allies. Some consider ancient practices as the highest mark of righteousness.</p>
<p id='15'>अपरे नैवमिच्छन्ति ये शङ्खलिखितप्रियाः। मात्सर्यादथवा लोभान ब्रूयुर्वाक्यमीदृशम्॥<br />They, however, who laud the conduct followed by Shankha towards Likhita, do not hold this opinion. They do not pass such an opinion through either malice or covetousness.</p>
<p id='16'>आर्षमप्यत्र पश्यन्ति विकर्मस्थस्य पातनम्। न तादृक्सदृशं किञ्चित् प्रमाणं दृश्यते क्वचित्॥<br />There are even great Rishis who have laid down that even preceptors, if addicted to evil practices, should be punished. But there is no recognised authority for such a holding.</p>
<p id='17'>देवताश्च विकर्मस्थं पातयन्ति नराधमम्। व्याजेन विन्दन् वित्तं हि धर्मात् स परिहीयते॥<br />The gods will punish such men when they happen to be vile and guilty of wicked practices. The king, who replenishes his treasury by fraudulent means, certainly deviates from the path of righteousness.</p>
<p id='18'>सर्वतः सत्कृतः सद्भिर्भूतिप्रवरकारणैः। हृदयेनाभ्यनुज्ञातो यो धर्मस्तं व्यवस्यति॥<br />That code of morality which is honoured by good persons in affluent circumstances, and which is approved by every honest man, should be followed.</p>
<p id='19'>यश्चतुर्गुणसम्पन्नं धर्मं ब्रूयात् स धर्मवित्। अहेरिव हि धर्मस्व पदं दुःखं गवेषितुम्॥<br />He is the master of duty who knows it as depending on all the four foundations. It is as difficult to find out the reasons of duties as it is difficult to find out the legs of the snake.</p>
<p id='20'>यथा मृगस्य विद्धस्य पदमेकं पदं नयेत्। स्रक्षेद् रुधिरलेपेन तथा धर्मपदं नयेत्॥<br />As a hunter discovers the track of a deer wounded with arrow by marking spots of blood on the ground, so should one try to find out the reasons of duties.</p>
<p id='21'>एवं सद्धिविनीतेन पथा गन्तव्यमित्युत। राजर्षीणां वृत्तमेतदवगच्छ युधिष्ठिर।॥<br />Thus should a man follow humbly the path of the good. Such was the conduct of the great royal sages of yore, O Yudhishthira.</p>
