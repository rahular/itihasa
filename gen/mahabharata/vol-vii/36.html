<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>व्यास उवाच अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। सिद्धानां चैव संवादं मनोश्चैव प्रजापतेः॥<br />Vyasa said “Regarding it is cited a old discourse between the ascetics and that lord of creation, viz., Manu.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>ऋषयस्तु व्रतपरा: समागम्य पुरा विभुम्। धर्मं पप्रच्छुरासीनमादिकाले प्रजापतिम्॥ कथमन्नं कथं पात्रं दानमध्ययनं तपः। कार्याकार्यं च यत् सर्वं शसं वै त्वं प्रजायते॥ तैरेवमुक्तो भगवान् मनुः स्वायम्भुवोऽब्रवीत्। शुश्रूषध्वं यथावृत्तं धर्मं व्याससमासतः॥<br />In the Krita age, a concourse of Rishis, of rigid vows, having approached the great and powerful lord of creation, Manu, while seated at his case requested him to describe duties, saying,-What food should be taken, who is to be considered a deserving person (for gifts), what gifts should be made, how should a person study and what penances should one perform and how, and what acts should be done and what acts should not be done. O lord of creation, tell us everything in detail. Thus solicited by them, the divine and self-sprung Manu said to them,-Listen to me as I describe the duties in brief and in detail.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>अनादेशे जपो होम उपवासस्तथैव च। आत्मज्ञानं पुण्यनद्यो यत्र प्रायश्च तत्पराः॥ अनादिष्टं तथैतानि पुण्यानि धरणीभृतः। सुवर्णप्राशनमपि रत्नादिस्नानमेव च॥<br />In regions which have not been forbidden, silent recitation of sacred Mantras, homa round fasts, knowledge of soul, sacred rivers, regions inhabited by men devoted to pious acts,-these have been laid down as purifying acts and objects. Certain mountains also are purifying, as also the eating of gold and bathing in waters into which have been washed gems and precious stones.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>देवस्थानाभिगमनमाज्यप्राशनमेव च। एतानि मेध्यं पुरुषं कुर्वन्त्याशु न संशयः॥<br />Sojourn to sacred pilgrimages and eating of sanctified butter,-these also, forsooth, speedily cleanse a man.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>न गर्वेण भवेत् प्राज्ञः कदाचिदपि मानवः। दीर्घमायुरथेच्छन् हि त्रिरात्रं चोष्णपो भवेत्॥<br />No man would ever be called wise if he is proud. If he wishes to live long, he should for three nights drink hot water as an expiation for the same.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>अदत्तस्यानुपादानं दानमध्ययनं तपः। अहिंसा सत्यमक्रोध इज्या धर्मस्य लक्षणम्॥<br />Refusal to take what is not given, gift, study of sacred books, penance, abstention from injury, truth, freedom from anger, and adoration of the gods in sacrifices,-these are the marks of virtue.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>स एव धर्मः सोऽधर्मो देशकाले प्रतिष्ठितः। आदानमनृतं हिंसा धर्मो ह्यावस्थिकः स्मृतः॥<br />Virtue again, according to time and place, becomes sin. Thus misappropriation of another's property, untruth, and injury and killing, may under special circumstances, become virtue.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>द्विविधौ चाप्युभावेतौ धर्माधर्मी विजानताम्। अप्रवृत्तिः प्रवृत्तिश्च द्वैविध्यं लोकवेदयोः॥ अप्रवृत्तेरमर्त्यत्वं मर्त्यत्वं कर्मणः फलम्। अशुभस्याशुभं विद्याच्छुभस्य शुभमेव च। एतयोश्चोभयोः स्यातां शुभाशुभतया तथा॥<br />To persons capable of judging, acts are of two kinds, viz., virtuous and sinful. From the worldly and the Vedic points of view again, virtue and vice become good or bad. From the Vedic point of view, virtue and vice, would be classed under action and inaction. Inaction, i.e., abstention from Vedic rites leads to liberation (from re-birth while the fruits of action) i.e., performance of Vedic rites, leads to repeated death and re-birth. From the worldly point of view, acts that are evil, lead to sins and those that are good, or virtue. From the worldly point of view, therefore, virtue and vice are to be marked out by the good and the evil character of their fruits.</p>

<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>ऊर्ध्वं भवति संदेहादिह दृष्टार्थमेव च। अपेक्षापूर्वकरणात् प्रायश्चित्तं विधीयते॥<br />Expiation has been laid down, for an act undertaken for the purpose of doing mischief (to some one) in the future, as well as for an act done whose consequence is apparently mischievous.</p>
