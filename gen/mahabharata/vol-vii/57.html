<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 57</h3><h4>Royal duties</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच नित्योद्युक्तेन वै राज्ञा भवितव्यं युधिष्ठिर। प्रशस्यते न राजा हि नारीवोद्यमवर्जितः॥<br />'The king, O Yudhishthira, should always address himself for action. That king does not deserve praise who, like a woman, is destitute of exertion.</p>
