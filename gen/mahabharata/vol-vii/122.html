<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 122</h3><h4>The story of Vasuhoma</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीपमितिहासं पुरातनम्। अङ्गेषु राजा द्युतिमान् वसुहोम इति श्रुतः॥<br />Bhishma said “Regarding it is cited the following old story. There was among the Angas a highly effulgent king called Vasuhoma.</p>
<p id='2'>स राजा धर्मविन्नित्यं सह पत्न्या महातपाः। मुञ्जपृष्ठं जगामाथ पितृदेवर्षिपूजितम्॥<br />That king was always engaged in acts of piety, and accompanied by his wife he always practised the austerest penances. He went to the spot called Munjaprishtha highly respected by the Pitris and the celestial Rishis.</p>
<p id='3'>तत्र शृङ्गे हिमवतो मेरौ कनकपर्वते। यत्र मुजावटे रामो जटाहरणमादिशत्॥<br />There, on that peak of Himavat, near the golden mountain of Meru. Rama, sitting under the shade of a well-known banian, had tied his matted locks together.</p>
<p id='4'>तदाप्रभृति राजेन्द्र ऋषिभिः संशितव्रतैः। मुजपृष्ठ इति प्रोक्तः स देशो रुद्रसेवितः॥<br />From that time, O king, the spot, which is a favourite resort of Rudra, passed by the naine of Munjaprishtha among Rishis of rigid vows.</p>
<p id='5'>स तत्र बहुभुिर्यक्तस्तदा श्रुतिमयैर्गुणैः। ब्राह्मणानामनुमतो देवर्षिसदृशोऽभवत्॥<br />Living there, king Vasuhoma acquired many pious attributes and, having gained the regard of the Brahmanas, came to be regarded as a celestial Rishi in holiness.</p>
<p id='6'>तं कदाचिददीनात्मा सखा शक्रस्य मानितः। अभ्यगच्छन्महीपालो मान्धाता शत्रुकर्शनः॥<br />One day, that grinder of enemies, that friend of Shakra, viz., king Mandhata of great soul, came to Vasuhoma on his mountain retreat.</p>
<p id='7'>सोपसृत्य तु मान्धाता वसुहोमं नराधिपम्। दृष्ट्वा प्रकृष्टतयसं विनेतोऽग्रेऽभ्यतिष्ठत॥<br />Arrived there, and seeing king Vasuhoma of austere penances, stood humbly before the latter.</p>
<p id='8'>वसुहोमोऽपि राज्ञो वै पाद्यमयँ न्यवेदयत्। सप्ताङ्गस्य तु राज्यस्य पप्रच्छ कुशलाव्यये॥<br />Vasuhoma offered his guest water to wash his feet, and the Arghya consisting of the usual articles, and enquired of him about the wellbeing or otherwise of his kingdom consisting of seven limbs.</p>
<p id='9'>सद्भिराचरितं पूर्वं यथावदनुयायिनम्। अपृच्छद् वसुहोमस्तं राजन् किं करवाणि ते॥<br />After this, Vasuhoma addressed his royal guest who strictly followed the conduct of the righteous men of old, saying,-What, О king, shall I do for you.</p>
<p id='10'>सोऽब्रवीत्परमप्रीतो मान्धाता राजसत्तमम्। वसुहोमं महाप्राज्ञमासीनं कुरुनन्दन॥<br />Thus addressed, O delighter of the Kurus, Mandhatri, that best of kings, highly pleased, answered the greatly wise Vasuhoma seated at his ease, in the following words.</p>
<p id='11'>मान्धातोवाच बृहस्पतेर्मतं राजन्नधीतं सकलं त्वया। तथैवोशनसं शास्त्रं विज्ञातं ते नरोत्तम॥<br />Mandhatri said You have, O king, studied all the doctrines of Brihaspati! O best of men, you know also the doctrines laid down by Ushanas.</p>
<p id='12'>तदहं ज्ञातुमिच्छामि दण्ड उत्पद्यते कथम्। किं चास्य पूर्वं जागर्ति किं वा परममुच्यते॥<br />I wish to know what is the origin of Punishment? What also is said to be its end?</p>
<p id='13'>कथं क्षत्रियसंस्थश्च दण्डः सम्प्रत्यवस्थितः। ब्रूहि मे समुहाप्राज्ञ ददाम्याचार्यवेतनम्॥<br />How Came Punishment to depend upon the Kshatriya? Tell me all this, O you of great wisdom. I approach you as a disciple ready to give you the tuition fee.</p>
<p id='14'>वसुहोम उवाच शृणु राजन् यथा दण्डः सम्भूतो लोकसंग्रहः। प्रजाविनयरक्षार्थं धर्मस्यात्मा सनातनः॥<br />Vasuhoma said Listen, O king, as to how Punishment, that upholder of the world, sprang up. It is the soul of righteousness, and eternal, and was created for preserving the proper government of all creatures.</p>
<p id='15'>ब्रह्मा यियक्षुर्भगवान् सर्वलोकपितामहः। ऋत्विजं नात्मनस्तुल्यं ददर्शेति हि नः श्रुतम्॥<br />We have heard that once upon a time, the Grandfather of all the worlds, viz., the divine Brahmana, desiring to celebrate a sacrifice, could not find a priest equally qualified like himself.</p>
<p id='16'>स गर्भ शिरसा देवो बहुवर्षाण्यधारयत्। पूर्णे वर्षसहस्रे तु स गर्भः क्षुवतोऽपतत्॥<br />Therefore, he once conceived in his brain and held the foetus there for many long years. After a thousand years, the great god sneezed. In that act, the foetus dropped from his head.</p>
<p id='17'>स क्षुपो नाम सम्भूतः प्रजापतिररिंदम्। ऋत्विगासीन्महाराज यज्ञे तस्य महात्मनः॥<br />The divine being, O chastiser of foes, who was thus born from Brahman passed by the name of Kshupa. Highly powerful be became a lord of creatures. That Kshupa officiated as priest, O king, in the sacrifice of the highsouled Grandfather.</p>
<p id='18'>तस्मिन् प्रवृत्ते सत्रे तु ब्रह्मणः पार्थिवर्षभ। दृष्ट्रपप्रधानत्वाद् दण्डः सोऽन्तर्हितोऽभवत्॥<br />Upon the commencement of that sacrifice, of Brahman, O best of kings, punishment disappeared on account of the visible form that the Grandfather was then obliged to assume.</p>
<p id='19'>तस्मिन्नन्तर्हिते चापि प्रजानां संकरोऽभवत्। नैव कार्यं न वाकार्यं भोज्याभोज्यं न विद्यते॥<br />Punishment having disappeared, a great confusion arose among all creatures. There was no longer any distinction between what should be done and what should not. All difference, again, between clean and unclean food disappeared.</p>
<p id='20'>पेयापेये कुतः सिद्धिर्हिसन्ति च परस्परम्। गम्यागम्यं तदा नासीत् स्वं परस्वं च वै समम्॥<br />Men could not distinguish between what drink was allowable and what drink was not. All creatures began to injure one another. There were no restraints about the union of the sexes. All idea of property disappeared.</p>
<p id='21'>परस्परं विलुम्पन्ति सारमेया यथामिषम्। अबलान् बलिनो मन्ति निर्मर्यादमवर्तत॥<br />All creatures began to rob, snatching meat from one another. The strong began to kill the weak. Nobody cared the least for his neighbour.</p>
<p id='22'>ततः पितामहो विष्णुं भगवन्तं सनातनम्। सम्पूज्य वरदं देवं महादेवमथाब्रवीत्॥ अत्र त्वमनुकम्पां वै कर्तुमर्हसि शंकर। संकरो न भवेदत्र यथा तद् वै विधीयताम्॥<br />Then, having adored the divine and eternal Vishnu, the grandfather addressed that great boon-giving god, saying,-You should, O Keshava, show mercy on the present occasion. Let it be so ordained by you that the confusion that has already set in may disappear.</p>
<p id='23'>ततः स भगवान् ध्यात्वा चिरं शूलवरायुधः। आत्मानमात्मना दण्डं ससृजे देवसत्तमः॥<br />Thus addressed, that foremost of gods, armed with an enormous Shula, thinking for some time, converted his ownself into the form of Punishment.</p>
<p id='24'>तस्माच्च धर्मचरणानीतिर्देवी सरस्वती। ससृजे दण्डनीतिं सा त्रिषु लोकेषु विश्रुता॥<br />From that form, having Righteousness for its legs, the goddess Sarasvati created Dandaniti (Science of Punishment) which very soon became celebrated all over the world.</p>
<p id='25'>भूयः स भगवान् ध्यात्वा चिरं शूलवरायुधः। तस्य तस्य निकायस्य चकारैकैकमीश्वरम्॥<br />Thereafter the great god armed with a huge Shula, having again reflected for sometime, appointed a few among the gods as the rulers of their respective classes.</p>
<p id='26'>देवानामीश्वरं चक्रे देवं दशशतेक्षणम्। यमं वैवस्वतं चापि पितृणामकरोत् प्रभुम्॥<br />It was then that he made the divine Indra of a thousand eyes the king of gods. Yama the son of Vivasvat was made the lord of the departed manes.</p>

<p id='29'>रुद्राणामपि चेशानं गोप्तारं विदधे प्रभुम्। महात्मानं महादेवं विशलाक्षं सनातनम्॥<br />The powerful Ishana the great and eternal Mahadeva, of three eyes, was made the king of the Rudras.</p>
<p id='30'>वसिष्ठमीशं विप्राणां वसूनां जातवेदसम्। तेजसा भास्करं चक्रे नक्षत्राणां निशाकरम्॥<br />Vashishtha was made the king of the Brahmanas, and Jatavedas was made the chief of the Vasus. Surya was made the lord of all luminous bodies and Chandramas was made the lord of Stars and constellations,</p>

<p id='33'>ईश्वरः सर्वदेवस्तु राजराजो नराधिपः। सर्वेषामेव रुद्राणां शूलपाणिरिति श्रुतिः॥<br />The Shrutis say that the great god Mahadeva, the lord of lords, O king, armed with Shula, is the lord of the Rudras.</p>
<p id='34'>तमेनं ब्रह्मणः पुत्रमनुजातं क्षुपं ददौ। प्रजानामधिपं श्रेष्ठं सर्वधर्मभृतामपि॥<br />The rod of punishment was given to Brahmana's latest-born son, viz., Kshupa, the lord of all creatures and the foremost of the virtuous.</p>
<p id='35'>महादेवस्ततस्तस्मिन् वृत्ते यज्ञे यथाविधि। दण्डं धर्मस्य गोप्तारं विष्णवे सत्कृतं ददौ॥<br />Upon the completion of that sacrifice according to due rites, Mahadeva after making proper reverence handed over Punishment, that protector of Righteousness, to Vishnu.</p>
<p id='36'>विष्णुरङ्गिरसे प्रादादङ्गिरा मुनिसत्तमः। प्रादादिन्द्रमरीचिभ्यां मरीचि गवे ददौ॥<br />Vishnu gave it to Angiras, and Angiras, that foremost of ascetics, handed it over to Indra and Marichi. Marichi gave it to Bhrigu.</p>

<p id='39'>विभज्य दण्डः कर्तव्यो धर्मेण न यदृच्छया। दुष्टानां निग्रहो दण्डो हिरण्यं बाह्यतः क्रिया॥<br />Punishment should be meted out with discrimination, guided by righteousness and not by caprice. It is intended for checking the wicked. Fines and confiscation are intended for creating terror, and not for replenishing the king's treasury.</p>
<p id='40'>व्यङ्गत्वं च शरीरस्य वधो नाल्पस्य कारणात्। शरीरपीडास्तास्ताश्च देहत्यागो विवासनम्॥<br />The wounding of one's body or the infliction of death should not be made for trivial causes. The infliction of physical pain by various means, hurling from tops of mountains, and punishment also, should not be guided by similar causes.</p>
