<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 129</h3><h4>The discourse on Morality between Gotama and Yama</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच नामृतस्येव पर्याप्तिर्ममास्ति ब्रुवति त्वयि। यथा हि स्वात्मवृत्तिस्थस्तथा तृप्तोऽस्मि भारत॥<br />Yudhishthira said Like one who drinks ambrosia my thirst is never satiated with the nectar of your words of wisdom as they fall from your mouth. As a person endued with a knowledge of self is never satiated with meditation, even so I am never satiated with hearing you.</p>
<p id='2'>तस्मात् कथय भूयस्त्वं धर्ममेव पितामह। न हि तृप्तिमहं यामि पिबन् धर्मामृतं हि ते॥<br />Do you, therefore, O grandfather, describe again morality. I am never satiated with drinking the ambrosia of your discourses upon morality.</p>
<p id='3'>भीष्म उवाच अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। गौतमस्य च संवादं यमस्य च महात्मनः॥<br />Bhishma said “Regarding it is cited the old discourse between Gotama ard the illustrious Yama.</p>
<p id='4'>पारियानं गिरिं प्राप्य गौतमस्याश्रमो महान्। उवास गौतमो यं च कालं तमपि मे शृणु॥ षष्टिं वर्षसहस्राणि सोऽतप्यद् गौतमस्तपः।<br />Gotama had a wide retrert on the Paripatra hills. Listen to me as to how many years he lived in that asylum. For sixty thousand years that sage practises ascetic austerities in that asylum.</p>
<p id='5'>तमुग्रतपसा युक्तं भावितं सुमहामुनिम्॥ उपयातो नरव्याघ्र लोकपालो यमस्तदा। तमपश्यत् सुतपस पृषि वै गौतमं तदा॥<br />One day, the Regent of the dead. Yama, O foremost of men, went to that great sage of purified soul while he was practising the severest austerities. Yama saw the great ascetic Gotama of rigid penances.</p>
<p id='6'>स तं विदित्वा ब्रह्मर्षिर्यममागतमोजसा। प्राञ्जलिः प्रयतो भूत्वा उपविष्टस्तपोधनः॥<br />Understanding that it was Yama who had come, the twice-born quickly saluted him and sat with closed hands in an attentive attitude,</p>
<p id='7'>तं धर्मराजो दृष्दैव सत्कृत्यैव द्विजर्षभम्। न्यमन्त्रयत धर्मेण क्रियतां किमिति ब्रुवन्॥<br />Beholding that foremost of Brahmanas, the royal Dharma duly saluted him and addressing him asked what he should do for him.</p>
<p id='8'>गौतम उवाच मातापितृभ्यामानृण्यं किं कृत्वा समवाप्नुयात्। कथं च लोकानाप्नोति पुरुषो दुर्लभाशुचीन्॥<br />Gotama said How does a man liberate his self from the debt he owes to his parents? How, also, does he succeed in acquiring blissful regions which it is so difficult to acquire.</p>
<p id='9'>यम उवाच तप:शौचवता नित्यं सत्यधर्मरतेन च। मातापित्रोरहरहः पूजनं कार्यमञ्जसा॥<br />Yama said Practising truth, purity and penances, one should continuously adore his parents.</p>
<p id='10'>अश्वमेधैश्च यष्टव्यं बहुभिः स्वाप्तदक्षिणैः। तेन लोकानवाप्नोति पुरुषोऽद्भुतदर्शनान्॥<br />One should, also, celebrate Horse-sacrifices with profuse presents to the Brahmanas. By such acts one acquires many happy and wonderful regions.'</p>
