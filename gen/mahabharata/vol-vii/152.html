<h3>APADDHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 152</h3><h4>The purificatory rites of a king</h4><p id='1'>शौनक उवाच तस्मात् तेऽहं प्रवक्ष्यामि धर्ममावृतचेतसे। श्रीमान् महाबलस्तुष्टः स्वयं धर्ममवेक्षसे॥<br />Shaunaka said I shall for these reasons describe to you virtue, you whose heart has been exceedingly agitated. Endued with knowledge, great strength, and a contented heart, you seek virtue of your own accord.</p>
<p id='2'>पुरस्ताद् दारुणो भूत्वा सुचित्रतरमेव तत्। अनुगृह्णाति भूतानि स्वेन वृत्तेन पार्थिवः॥<br />First becoming exceedingly stern, a king then shows mercy and does good to all creatures by his acts. This is certainly very wonderful.</p>
<p id='3'>कृत्स्नं नूनं स दहति इति लोको व्यवस्यति। यत्र त्वं तादृशो भूत्वा धर्ममेवानुपश्यसि॥<br />People say that that king who begins with sternness consumes the entire world. You were stern before. But you now seck righteousness.</p>
<p id='4'>हित्वा तु सुचिरं भक्ष्यं भोज्यांश्च तप आस्थितः। इत्येतदभिभूतानामद्भुतं जनमेजय॥<br />Forsaking luxurious food and all articles of enjoyment, you are now practising rigid penances for a long time. All this, O Janamejaya, is sure to appear wonderful to those kings who are sunk in sin.</p>
<p id='5'>योऽदुर्लभो भवेद् दाता कृपणो वा तपोधनः। अनाश्चर्यं तदित्याहु तिदूरेण वर्तते॥<br />It is not at all wonderful that he who has wealth should become liberal, or that he who has wealth of asceticism should become unwilling to spend it. It has been said that the one does not live far off from the other.</p>
<p id='6'>एतदेव हि कार्पण्यं समग्रमसमीक्षितम्। यचेत्सममीक्षयैव स्याद्भवेत्तस्मिस्ततो गुणः॥<br />An ill-judged thing produces enough of miserics. That, on the other hand, which is done with the help of sound judgement yields excellent results.</p>
<p id='7'>यज्ञो दानं दया वेदाः सत्यं च पृथिवीपते। पञ्चैतानि पवित्राणि षष्ठं सुचरितं तपः॥ तदेव राज्ञां परमं पवित्रं जनमेजया<br />Sacrifice, gift, mercy, the Vedas, and truth, O king,-these five,-are purifying. The sixth is penance well-practised. This last, O Janamejaya, is highly purifying for kings.</p>
<p id='8'>तेन सम्यग्गृहीतेन श्रेयांसं धर्ममाप्स्यसि॥ पुण्यदेशाभिगमन पवित्रं परमं स्मृतम्।<br />By following it duly, you are sure to acquire great merit and blessedness. Pilgrimage to sacred places has also been described to be highly purifying</p>
<p id='9'>अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीमां गाथां गीतां ययातिना॥ यो मर्त्यः प्रतिपद्येत आयुर्जीवितमात्मनः। यज्ञमेकान्ततः कृत्वा तत् संन्यस्य तपश्चरेत्॥<br />Regarding it is cited the following verse sung by Yayati-That mortal who would acquire life and longevity should, after having celebrated sacrifices with devotion, renounce them and practise penances.</p>
<p id='10'>पुण्यमाहुः कुरुक्षेत्रं कुरुक्षेत्रात् सरस्वतीम्। सरस्वत्याश्च तीर्थानि तीर्थेभ्यश्च पृथूदकम्॥ यत्रावगाह्य पीत्वा च नैनं श्वोमरणं तपेत्। महासरः पुष्कराणि प्रभासोत्तरमानसे॥<br />The field of Kuru has been described to be sacred. The river Sarasvati is considered more so. The Tirthas of the Sarasvati are inore sacred than the Sarasvati herself; and the Tirtha called Prithudaka is more sacred than all the Tirthas of the Sarasvati. One that has bathed in Prithudaka and drunk its waters will not have to be sorry for a premature death.</p>
<p id='11'>कालोदकं च गन्तासि लब्धायुर्जीविते पुनः। सरस्वतीदृषद्वत्योः संगमो मानसः सरः॥ स्वाध्यायशीलः स्थानेषु सर्वेषु समुपस्पृशेत्। त्यागधर्मः पवित्राणां संन्यासं मनुरब्रवीत्॥<br />You should go to Mahasaras, to all the Tirthas known by the name of Pushkara, to Prabhasa, to the northern lake Manasa, and to Kalodaka. You will then regain life and acquire longevity. Lake Manasa is where the Sarasvati and the Drishadvati join each other. A person endued with Vedic lore should bathe in these places. Manu has said that liberality is the highest of all duties, and that renunciation is better than liberality.</p>

<p id='13'>न ह्यस्ति सर्वभूतेषु दुःखमस्मिन् कुतः सुखम्। एवं प्रकृतिभूतानां सर्वसंसर्गयायिनाम्॥<br />For all creatures there is in this world neither misery nor happiness. Such is the true nature of all living creatures.</p>
<p id='14'>त्यजतां जीवितं श्रेयो निवृत्ते पुण्यपापके। यत्त्वेव राज्ञो ज्यायिष्ठं कार्याणां तद् ब्रवीमि ते ॥<br />Of all creatures, they are superior who have betaken themselves to renunciation and abstained from acts both meritorious and sinful, I shall now tell you those acts which are best for a king.</p>

<p id='17'>अपि धिक्रियमाणोऽपि त्यज्यमानोऽप्यनेकधा। आत्मनो दर्शनाद् विप्रान्न हन्तास्मीति मार्गया घटमानः स्वकार्येषु कुरु निःश्रेयसं परम्॥<br />Though they have censured you and though they have deserted you, do you still, guided by knowledge of self, solemnly promise never to injure them, Engaged in becoming acts, try to do what is for your highest good.</p>

<p id='19'>न विशेषेण गन्तव्यमविच्छिन्नेन वा पुनः। न जातु नाहमस्मीति सुप्रसक्तमसाधुषु।॥<br />He who wishes to prevent self-destruction, should never mix with wicked persons for general or particular purposes.</p>

By committing such an act again and again, one may purify himself by visiting sacred places.</p>
<p id='22'>कल्याणमनुकर्तव्यं पुरुषेण बुभूषता। ये सुगन्धीनि सेवन्ते तथागन्धा भवन्ति ते॥ ये दुर्गन्धीनि सेवन्ते तथागन्धा भवन्ति ते!<br />One who wishes to acquire prosperity should do all that yields blessedness. They who live amidst fragrance themselves become fragrant by virtue thereof. They, on the other hand, who live in the midst of foul smell themselves become foui.</p>
<p id='23'>तपश्चर्यापरः सद्यः पापाद् विपरिमुच्यते॥ संवत्सरमुपास्याग्निमभिशस्तः प्रमुच्यते।<br />One who practises ascetic austerities is soon purged of all one's sins. By adoring the sacrificial fire for a year, one sullied by various sins becomes purified.</p>
<p id='24'>त्रीणि वर्षाण्युपास्याग्निं भ्रूणहा विप्रमुच्यते।।२७ महासरः पुष्कराणि प्रभासोत्तरमानसे। अभ्येत्य योजनशतं भ्रूणहा विप्रमुच्यते॥ यावतः प्राणिनो हन्यात् तज्जातीयांस्तु तावतः प्रमीयमानानुन्मोच्य प्राणिहा विप्रमुच्यते॥<br />One guilty of foeticide is purified by adoring the fire for three years. One guilty for foeticide becomes purifies at even a hundred Yojanas from Mahasara, or the Tirthas called Pushkara, or Prabhasa, or Manasa on the north, if only he sets out for any of them. A slayer of creatures is purged of his sins by saving from impending danger as many creatures of that particular kind as have been killed by him.</p>

<p id='28'>उभे तु यस्य सदृशे भवेतां किंस्वित्तयोस्तत्र जयोथ न स्यात्। आचक्ष्व नः पुण्यपैलं महर्षे कथं पापं नुदते धर्मशीलः।।३३।<br />Can not that person free himself from both virtue and sin who regards the two (happiness and inisery) equally?
