<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 125</h3><h4>An account of hope</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच शीलं प्रधानं पुरुषे कथितं ते पितामह। कथं त्वाशा समुत्पन्ना या चाशा तद् वदस्व मे॥<br />Yudhishthira said You have said, O grandfather, that conduct is the first thing (for a man). Whence, however, does Hope arise? Tell me what it is.</p>
<p id='2'>संशयो मे महानेष समुत्पन्नः पितामह। छेत्ता च तस्य नान्योऽस्ति त्वत्तः परपुरजय॥<br />This great doubt has occupied my mind. There is no other person than you, Osubjugator of hostile towns, who can remove it!</p>
<p id='3'>पितामहाशा महती ममासीद्धि सुयोधने। प्राप्ते युद्धे तु तद् युक्तं तत् कर्तायमिति प्रभो॥<br />O grandfather, I had great hope about Suyodhana that when a battle was about to take place, he would, O lord, do what was proper.</p>
<p id='4'>सर्वस्याशा सुमहती पुरुषस्योपजायते। तस्यां विहन्यमानायां दुःखो मृत्युर्न संशयः॥<br />Hope is tne sheet-anchor of every man. When that hope is destroyed, great grief follows which, forsooth, is almost equal to death itself.</p>
<p id='5'>सोऽहं हताशो दुर्बुद्धिः कृतस्तेन दुरात्मना। धार्तराष्ट्रेण राजेन्द्र पश्य मन्दात्मतां मम॥<br />Fool that I am, Dhritarashtra's wicked son, Duryodhana, destroyed the hope I had entertained. Mark, O king, the foolishness of my mind.</p>
<p id='6'>आशां महत्तरां मन्ये पर्वतादपि सदुमात्। आकाशादपि वा राजनप्रमेयैव वा पुनः॥<br />I think that hope is bigger than a mountain with all its trees. Or, perhaps, it is bigger than the sky itself. Or, perhaps, O king, it is really immeasurable.</p>
<p id='7'>एषा चैव कुरुश्रेष्ठ दुर्विचिन्त्या सुदुर्लभा। दुर्लभत्वाच्च पश्यामि किमन्यद् दुर्लभं ततः॥<br />Hope, O chief of the Kurus, is highly difficult of being understood and equally difficult of being conquered. Seeing this last attribute of Hope, I ask, what else is so unconquerable as this?</p>
<p id='8'>भीष्म उवाच अत्र ते वर्तयिष्यामि युधिष्ठिर निबोध तत्। इतिहासं सुमित्रस्य निर्वृत्तमृषभस्य च॥<br />Bhishma said I shall describe to you, O Yudhishthira, regarding it, the discourse between Sumitra and Rishabha that took place in days of yore, Listen to it!</p>
<p id='9'>सुमित्रो नाम राजर्षिर्हहयो मृगयां गतः। ससार स मृगं विद्ध्वा बाणेनानतपर्वणा॥<br />A royal sage of the Haihaya family, Sumitra by namre, went a hunting. Having pierced a deer with a straight arrow, he pursued it.</p>
<p id='10'>स मृगो बाणमादाय यथामितविक्रमः। स च राजा बलात् तूर्णं ससार मृगयूथपम्॥<br />Endued with great strength, the deer ran ahead, with the arrow sticking to him. The king was equally powerful, and accordingly pursued his precious game with great speed.</p>
<p id='11'>ततो निम्न स्थलं चैव स मृगोऽद्रवदाशुगः। मुहूर्तमिव राजेन्द्र समेन स पथागमत्॥<br />The animal, highly fleet, quickly ran a low ground and then a level plain.</p>
<p id='12'>ततः स राजा तारुण्यादौरसेन बलेन च। ससार बाणासनभृत् सखगोऽसौ तनुत्रवान्॥<br />The king, young, active, and strong, and armed with bow and sword and protected with a coat of mail, still pursued it.</p>
<p id='13'>ततो नदान नदीश्चैव पल्वलानि बनानि च। अतिक्रम्याभ्यतिक्रम्य ससारैको वनेचरः॥<br />Having none with him to chase the animal through the forest, the king crossed many rivers and lakes.</p>
<p id='14'>स तु कामान्मृगो राजन्नासाद्यासाद्य तं नृपम्। पुनरभ्येति जवनो जवेन महता ततः॥<br />Possessed of great fleetness the animal, at its will, appearing now and then before the king, ran on with great quickness.</p>
<p id='15'>स तस्य बाणैर्बहुभिः समभ्यस्तो वनेचरः। प्रक्रीडन्निव राजेन्द्र पुनरभ्येति चान्तिकम्॥<br />Pierced with many arrows by the king, that wild animal, O monarch, as if in sport, again and again lessened the distance between itself and the pursuer.</p>
<p id='16'>पुनश्च जवमास्थाय जवनो मृगयूथपः। अतीत्यातीत्य राजेन्द्र पुनरभ्येति चान्तिकम्॥<br />Repeatedly showing its quickness and crossing one forest after another, it now and then appeared before the king at a near point.</p>
<p id='17'>तस्य मर्मच्छिदं घोरं तीक्ष्णं चामित्रकदर्शनः। समादाय शरं श्रेष्ठं कार्मुके तु तथासृजत्॥<br />At last, taking up a very excellent arrow, sharp, terrible, and capable of cutting the very vitals, the crusher of foes, set it on his bowstring.</p>
<p id='18'>ततो गव्यूतिमात्रेण मृगयूथपयूथपः। तस्य बाणपथं मुक्त्वा तस्थिवान् प्रहसन्निव॥<br />That huge animal then, as if laughing at the pursuer's efforts, suddenly went to a great distance by reaching a point full four miles ahead of the range of the arrow.</p>
<p id='19'>तस्मिन् निपतिते बाणे भूमौ ज्वलिततेजसि। प्रविवेश महारण्यं मृगो राजाप्यथाद्रवत्॥<br />That effulgent arrow accordingly fell on the ground. The deer entered a large forest, but the king still pursued it.</p>
