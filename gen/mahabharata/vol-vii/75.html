<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 75</h3><h4>The virtues by which a king acquires happiness in the next world.</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच यथा वृत्त्या महीपालो विवर्धयति मानवान्। पुण्यांश्च लोकान् जयति तन्मे ब्रूहि पितामह॥<br />Yudhishthira said Describe to me, O grandfather, the conduct by which a king succeeds in advancing his subjects and earning regions of happiness in the other world.</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच दानशीलो भवेद् राजा यज्ञशीलश्च भारत। उपवासतप:शीलः प्रजानां पालने रतः॥<br />Bhishma said "The king should be liberal and should celebrate sacrifices, O Bharata. He should observe vows and penances, and should be devoted to the duty of protecting his subjects.</p>
<p id='3'>सर्वाश्चैव प्रजा नित्यं राजा धर्पण पालयन्। उत्थानेन प्रदानेन पूजयेच्चापि धार्मिकान्॥<br />Virtuously protecting all his subjects he should honour all pious persons by standing up when they come and by making presents to them.</p>
<p id='4'>राज्ञा हि पूजितो धर्मस्ततः सर्वत्र पूज्यते। यद् यदाचरते राजा तत् प्रजानां स्म रोचते॥<br />If the king honours it, righteousness is honoured everywhere. Whatever acts and things a king likes they are liked by his subjects.</p>
<p id='5'>नित्यमुद्यतदण्डश्च भवेन्मृत्युरिवारिषु। निहन्यात् सर्वतो दस्यून न कामात् कस्यचित् क्षमेत्॥५<br />The king should always be like Death to his enemies with the rod of punishment uplifted in his hands, He should root out robbers in his kingdom and never pardon any one capriciously.</p>
<p id='6'>यं हि धर्मं चरन्तीह प्रजा राज्ञा सुरक्षिताः। चतुर्थं तस्य धर्मस्य राजा भारत विन्दति॥<br />The king, O Bharata, acquires a fourth part of merit that his subjects acquire under his shelter.</p>
<p id='7'>यदधीते यद् ददाति यज्जुहोति यदर्चति। राजा चतुर्थभाक् तस्य प्रजा धर्मेण पालयन्॥ यद् राष्ट्रेऽकुशलं किञ्चिद् राज्ञोऽरक्षयतः प्रजाः। चतुर्थं तस्य पापस्य राजा भारत विन्दति॥<br />By only protecting his subjects the king acquires a fourth part of merit that his subjects acquire by study, by gift, by pouring libations, and by adoring the gods. The king acquires a fourth part of also the sin that his subjects commit on account, any distress in the kingdom arising from the king's neglect in satisfying the duty of protection.</p>
<p id='8'>अप्याहुः सर्वमेवेति भूयोऽर्धमिति निश्चयः। कर्मणः पृथिवीपाल नृशंसोऽनृतवागपि॥<br />Some say that the king earns a half, and some say the full measure, of whatever sin is caused by his becoming cruel and a liar.</p>
<p id='9'>तादृशात् किल्बिषाद् राजा शृणु येन प्रमुच्यते। प्रत्याहर्तुमशक्यं स्याद् धनं चोरैर्हतं यदि। तत् स्वकोशात् प्रदेयं स्यादशक्तेनोपजीवतः॥<br />Listen now to the means by which the king may purge off such sins. If the king fails to restore to a subject the wealth that has been stolen away by thieves he should then make good the loss from his own treasury, or, in case of inability, with wealth taken from his dependants.</p>
<p id='10'>सर्ववर्णः सदा रक्ष्यं ब्रह्मस्वं ब्राह्मणा यथा। न स्थेयं विषये तेन योऽपकुर्याद् द्विजातिषु॥<br />All the cases should protect the wealth of a Brahmana as well as his body and life. The person that offends against Brahmanas should be banished from the kingdom.</p>
<p id='11'>ब्रह्मस्वे रक्ष्यमाणे तु सर्वं भवति रक्षितम्। तस्मात् तेषां प्रसादेन कृतकृत्यो भवेन्नृपः॥<br />Everything is protected by protecting Brahmana's wealth. Through the favour of the Brahmanas, which may thus be secured, the king becomes crowned with success.</p>
<p id='12'>पर्जन्यमिव भूतानि महाद्रुममिव द्विजाः। नरास्तमुपजीवन्ति नृपं सर्वार्थसाधकम्॥<br />Men seek the shelter of a capable king like creatures seeking relief from the clouds or birds seeking refuge in a large tree.</p>
<p id='13'>न हि कामात्मना राज्ञा सततं कामबुद्धिना। नृशंसेनातिलुब्धेन शक्यं पालयितुं प्रजाः॥<br />A cruel and covetous king, always lustful and seeking the gratification of his desires can never protect his subject.'</p>
<p id='14'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच नाहं राज्यसुखान्वेषी राज्यमिच्छाम्यपि क्षणम्। धर्मार्थं रोचये राज्यं धर्मश्चात्र न विद्यते॥<br />Yudhishthira said I do not, for a moment, seek the happiness of sovereignty itself for its own sake. I desire it, however, for the sake of the merit one may gain from it. It seems to me that it has no merit.</p>
<p id='15'>तदलं मम राज्येन यत्र धर्मो न विद्यते। वनमेव गमिष्यामि तस्माद् धर्मचिकीर्षया॥ तत्र मेध्येष्वरण्येषु न्यस्तदण्डो जितेन्द्रियः। धर्ममाराधयिष्यामि मुनिर्मूलफलाशनः॥<br />There is no such necessity by which no merit can be acquired. I shall, therefore, retire. into the forest acquiring religious merit. Laying aside the rod of punishment and controlling my senses, I shall go to the forest which is sacred and seek to acquire the merit of righteousness by becoming an ascetic living upon fruits and roots."</p>
<p id='16'>भीष्म उवाच वेदाहं तव या बुद्धिरानृशंस्यगुणैव सा। न च शुद्धनृशंस्येन शक्यं राज्यमुपासितम्॥<br />Bhishma said 'I know, O Yudhishthira, what the nature of your heart is, and how inoffensive you are. You will not, however, by inoffensiveness alone, succeed in governing your kingdom.</p>
<p id='17'>अपि तु त्वां मृदुप्रज्ञमत्यार्यमतिधार्मिकम्। क्लीबं धर्मघृणायुक्तं न लोको बहु मन्यते॥<br />Your heart is mild by nature, you are merciful, and highly righteous. You are without energy, are virtuous and full of compassion. People, however, do not respect you.</p>
<p id='18'>वृत्तं तु स्वमपेक्षस्व पितृपैतामहोचितम्। नैव राज्ञां तथा वृत्तं यथा त्वं स्थातुमिच्छसि॥<br />Follow the conduct of your father and grandfather. Kings should never follow the conduct which you seek to adopt.</p>
<p id='19'>न हि वैक्लव्यसंसृष्टमानृशंस्यमिहास्थितः। प्रजापालनसम्भूतमाप्ता धर्मफलं ह्यसि॥<br />Never be affected by anxiety, and never adopt such inoffensive conduct. By becoming so, you would not earn that merit of righteousness which arises from protecting subjects.</p>
<p id='20'>न ह्येतामाशिषं पाण्डुर्न च कुन्ती त्वयाचता तथैतत् प्रज्ञया तात यथाऽऽचरसि मेधया॥<br />The conduct you wish to follow urged on by your intelligence and wisdom, is not quiet of a piece with those blessings which your father Pandu or your mother Kunti used to solicit for you.</p>
<p id='21'>शौर्य बलं च सत्यं च पिता तव सदाब्रवीत्। माहात्म्यं च महौदार्यं भवतः कुन्त्ययाचत॥<br />Your father always prayed for your courage, might, and truth. Kunti always prayed for your high-mindedness and liberality.</p>
<p id='22'>नित्यं स्वाहा स्वधा नित्यं चोभे मानुषदैवते। पुढेष्वाशासते नित्यं पितरो दैवतानि च।॥<br />The offerings with Svaha and Svadha in Shraddhas and sacrifices are always solicited from children by the Pitris and the deities.</p>
<p id='23'>दानमध्ययनं यज्ञं प्रजानां परिपालनम्। धर्ममेतदधर्मं वा जन्मनैवाभ्यजायथाः॥<br />Whether gifts, study, sacrifices and the protection of subjects, virtuous of sinful you are born to practise and perform them.</p>
<p id='24'>काले धुरि च युक्तानां वहतां भारमाहितम्। सीदतामपि कौन्तेय न कीर्तिरवसीदति॥<br />The fame of men never suffers, even it they fail in bearing the burden which is placed on them and to which they are wedded for life.</p>
<p id='25'>समन्ततो विनियतो वहत्यस्खलितो हि यः। निर्दोषः कर्मवचनात् सिद्धिः कर्मण एव सा॥<br />Even a horse, if properly trained, succeeds in carrying without dropping down a burden. One incurs no blame if only his acts and words be proper, for success depends upon them,</p>
<p id='26'>नैकान्तविनिपातेन विचचारेह कश्चन। धर्मी गृही वा राजा वा ब्रह्मचारी यथा पुनः॥<br />No person, be he a virtuous house-holder, or be he a king, or be he a Brahmacharin, has ever succeeded in conducting himself without failure.</p>
<p id='27'>अल्पं हि सारभूयिष्ठं यत् कर्मोदारमेव तत्। कृतमेवाकृताच्छ्रेयो न पापीयोऽस्त्यकर्मणः॥<br />It is better to do an act which is good and which carries but limited merit than to totally abstain from all acts, for perfect inaction is very culpable.</p>
<p id='28'>यदा कुलीनो धर्मज्ञः प्राणोत्यैश्वर्यमुत्तमम्। योगक्षेमस्तदा राज्ञः कुशलायैव कल्प्यते॥<br />When a high-born and righteous person acquires profuse wealth the king then succeeds in obtaining prosperity in all his works.</p>
<p id='29'>दानेनान्यं बलेनान्यमन्यं सूनृतया गिरा। सर्वतः प्रतिगृह्णीयाद् राज्यं प्राप्येह धार्मिकः॥<br />A virtuous king, having obtained a kingdom, should try to subdue some by presents, some by force, and some by sweet words.</p>
<p id='30'>यं हि वैद्याः कुले जाता ह्यवृत्तिभयपीडिताः। प्राप्य तृप्ताः प्रतिष्ठन्ति धर्मः कोऽभ्यधिकस्ततः॥<br />There is no one more virtuous than he, upon whom high-born and learned persons depend from fear of losing their means of sustenance and depending upon upon whom they live contentedly.</p>
<p id='31'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच किं तात परमं स्वयँ का ततः प्रीतिरुत्तमा। किं ततः परमैश्वर्यं ब्रूहि मे यदि पश्यसि॥<br />Yudhishthira said What acts, O sir, lead to heaven? What is the nature of the great happiness that is derived from them? What also is the high prosperity that may be obtained from them? Tell me all this, if you know.</p>
<p id='32'>भीष्म उवाच यस्मिन् भयादितः सम्यक् क्षेमं विन्दत्यपि क्षणम्। स स्वर्गजित्तमोऽस्माकं सत्यमेतद् ब्रवीमि ते॥<br />Bhishma said That man, from whom a person assailed by fear obtains even a momentary relief, deserves heaven from amongst the best of us. What I tell you is very true.</p>
