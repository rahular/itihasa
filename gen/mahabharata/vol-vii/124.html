<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 124</h3><h4>The characteristics of virtuous conduct and how it can be acquired</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच इमे जना नरश्रेष्ठ प्रशंसन्ति सदा भुवि। धर्मस्य शीलमेवादी ततो मे संशयो महान्॥शा<br />Yudhishthira said All persons on Earth, O foremost of men, speak highly of virtuous conduct, I have, however, great misgivings regarding this subject of their praise.</p>
<p id='2'>यदि तच्छक्यमस्माभिर्जातुं धर्मभृतां वर। श्रोतुमिच्छामि तत् सर्वं यथैतदुपलभ्यते॥<br />If the subject be not far from our comprehension, O foremost of virtuous men, I wish to hear everything about the way in which virtuous conduct can be acquired.</p>
<p id='3'>कथं तत् प्राप्यते शीलं श्रोतुमिच्छामि भारत। किंलक्षणं च तत् प्रोक्तं ब्रूहि मे वदतां वरः॥<br />How is, that conduct acquired, O Bharata! I wish to hear it. Tell me also, O foremost of orators, what are the characteristics of that conduct.</p>
<p id='4'>भीष्म उवाच पुरा दुर्योधनेनेह धृतराष्ट्राय मानद। आख्यातं तप्यमानेन श्रियं दृष्ट्वा तथागताम्॥ इन्द्रप्रस्थे महाराज तव सभ्रातृकस्य ह। सभायां चाह वचनं तत् सर्वं शृणु भारत॥<br />Bhishma said 'Formerly, O givers of honours, Duryodhana while burning within at your and your brothers' prosperity at Indraprastha, and for the jeers he received for his mistakes at the grand palace, had asked his father Dhritarashtra the same question. Hear what transpired at that time, O Bharata.</p>
<p id='5'>भवतस्तां सभां दृष्ट्वा समृद्धिं चाप्यनुत्तमाम्। दुर्योधनस्तदाऽऽसीनः सर्वं पित्रे न्यवेदयत्॥<br />Having seen that grand palace and that great prosperity of yours, Duryodhana, while sitting before his father described to him of all he had seen.</p>
<p id='6'>श्रुत्वा हि धृतराष्ट्रश्च दुर्योधनवचस्तदा। अब्रवीत् कर्णसहितं दुर्योधनमिदं वचः॥<br />Having heard the words of Duryodhana, Dhritarashtra, addressing his son and Karna, replied to him as follows.</p>
<p id='7'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच किमर्थं तप्यसे पुत्र श्रोतुमिच्छामि तत्त्वतः। श्रुत्वा त्वामनुनेष्यामि यदि सम्यग् भविष्यति॥<br />Dhritarashtra said Why do you grieve, O son! I wish to hear the cause fully. If after hearing the reasons they appear to be sufficient, I shall then try to instruct you.</p>
<p id='8'>त्वया च महदैश्वर्यं प्राप्तं परपुञ्जय। किंकरा भ्रातरः सर्वे मित्रसम्बन्धिनः सदा॥<br />O subjugator of hostile towns, you too have acquired great affluence. All your brothers are ever obedient to your, as also all your friends and relatives.</p>
<p id='9'>आच्छादयसि प्रावारान नासि पिशितौदनम्। आजानेया वहन्त्यश्वाः केनासि हरिणः कृशः॥<br />You are clad in the best robes. You take the richest food. Horses of the best species bear you. Why then have you become pale and emaciated?</p>
<p id='10'>दुर्योधन उवाच दश तानि सहस्राणि स्नातकानां महात्मनाम्। भुञ्जते रुक्मपात्रीभिर्युधिष्ठिरनिवेशने॥<br />Duryodhana said Ten thousands of great Snataka Brahmanas daily take their food at Yudhishthira's palace from plates of gold.</p>
<p id='11'>दृष्ट्वा च तां सभां दिव्यां दिव्यपुष्पफलान्विताम्। अश्वांस्तित्तिरकल्माषान् वस्त्राणि विविधानि च॥ दृष्ट्वा तां पाण्डवेयानामृद्धिं वैश्रवणीं शुभाम्। अमित्राणां सुमहतीमनुशोचामि भारत॥<br />Seeing his beautiful palaces adorned with excellent flowers and fruits, his horses of the Tittiri and the Kalmasha breeds, his dresses of various sorts, indeed, seeing that high prosperity of my enemies, viz., the sons of Pandu,-a prosperity resembling that of Vaishravana himself,-I am burning with grief, O Bharata!-</p>
<p id='12'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच यदीच्छसि श्रियं तात तादृशी सा युधिष्ठिरे। विशिष्टां वा नरव्याघ्र शीलवान् भव पुत्रक॥<br />Dhritarashtra said If you wish, O sire, to acquire prosperity like that of Yudhishthira or that which is even superior to it, do you then, O son, try to be of virtuous conduct.</p>
<p id='13'>शीलेन हि त्रयो लोकाः शक्या जेतुं न संशयः। न हि किंचिदसाध्यं वै लोके शीलवतां भवेत्॥<br />Forsooth, one may, by his conduct alone, conquer the three words. There is nothing which virtuous persons cannot obtain.</p>
<p id='14'>एकरात्रेण मान्धाता त्र्यहेण जनमेजयः। सप्तरात्रेण नाभागः पृथिवीं प्रतिपेदिरे॥<br />Mandhata conquered the whole word in only one night, Janamejaya, in course of three; and Nabhaga, in course of seven.</p>
<p id='15'>एते हि पार्थिवाः सर्वे शीलवन्तो दयान्विताः। अतस्तेषां गुणक्रीता वसुधा स्वयमागता॥<br />All these kings were endued with mercy and virtuous conduct. Therefore, the Earth came to them at their will, won over by their virtues!</p>
<p id='16'>दुर्योधन उवाच कथं तत् प्राप्यते शीलं श्रोतुमिच्छामि भारत। येन शीलेन तैः प्राप्ता क्षिप्रमेव वसुन्धरा॥<br />Duryodhana said I wish to hear, O Bharata, how that conduct may be acquired, by which the Earth was won by them so quickly!-</p>
<p id='17'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। नारदेन पुरा प्रोक्तं शीलमाश्रित्य भारत॥<br />Dhritarashtra said Regarding it the following old narrative is cited. It was formerly recited by Narada, with regard to virtuous conduct.</p>
<p id='18'>प्रहादेन हृतं राज्यं महेन्द्रस्य महात्मनः। शीलमाश्रित्या दैत्येन त्रैलोक्यं च वशे कृतम्॥<br />In days of yore, the Daitya Prahlada, by the merit of his conduct, snatched from the great Indra his sovereignty and brought the three worlds under subjection.</p>
<p id='19'>ततो बृहस्पति शक्रः प्राञ्जलिः समुपस्थितः। तमुवाच महाप्राज्ञः श्रेय इच्छामि वेदितुम्॥<br />Shakra then, with joined hands, approached Brihaspati. Endued with great wisdom, the god of the celestials addressed to the great preceptor, saying,-I desire you to tell me the source of happiness.</p>
<p id='20'>ततो बृहस्पतिस्तस्मै ज्ञानं नैःश्रेयसं परम्। कथयामास भगवान् देवेन्द्राय कुरूद्वह॥<br />Thus accosted, Brihaspati said to him that Knowledge is the source of the greatest happiness.</p>
<p id='21'>एतावच्छ्रेय इत्येव बृहस्पतिरभाषत। इन्द्रस्तु भूयः पप्रच्छ को विशेषो भवेदिति॥<br />Indeed, Brihaspati pointed out knowledge to be the source of supreme happiness. Indra, however, once more asked him as to whether there was any thing superior to that.</p>
<p id='22'>बृहस्पतिरुवाच विशेषोऽस्ति महांस्तात भार्गवस्य महात्मनः। अत्रागमय भद्रं ते भूय एवं सुरर्षभ॥<br />Brihaspati said There is some thing, O son, which is still higher. The great Bhargava (Ushanas) will instruct your better. Go to him, blessed be you, and enquire of him, O king of the celestials!</p>
<p id='23'>आत्मनस्तु ततः श्रेयो भार्गवात् सुमहातपाः। ज्ञानमागमयत् प्रीत्या पुनः स परमद्युतिः।।२५]<br />Endued with great ascetic merit and effulgence, the king of the celestials then went to Bhargava and acquired from him, with a gratified heart, a knowledge of that which was to his greatest good.</p>
<p id='24'>तेनापि समनुज्ञातो भार्गवेण महात्मना। श्रेयोऽस्तीति पुनर्भूयः शुक्रमाह शतक्रतुः॥<br />Acquiring the permission of the great Bhargava, the celebrator of a hundred sacrifices once more asked the sage as to whether there was anything superior to what the sage had already told him.</p>
<p id='25'>भार्गवस्त्वाह सर्वज्ञः प्रहादस्य महात्मनः। ज्ञानमस्मि विशेषेणेत्युक्तो हृष्टश्च सोऽभवत्॥<br />The omniscient Bhargava said,-The great Prahlada has better knowledge!-Learning this, Indra became highly pleased.</p>
<p id='26'>स ततो ब्राह्मणो भूत्वा प्रहादं पाकशासनः। गत्वा प्रोवाच मेधावी श्रेय इच्छामि वेदितुम्॥<br />The chastiser of Paka, endued with supreme intelligence, assumed the form of a Brahman and going to Prahlada, asked him saying-I desire to hear what conduces to felicity.</p>
<p id='27'>प्रहादस्त्वब्रवीद् विप्रं क्षणो नास्ति द्विजर्षभ। त्रैलोक्यराज्यसक्तस्य ततो नोपदिशामि ते॥<br />Prahlada answered the Brahmana, saying,-O chief of the twice-born, I have no time, being wholly engaged with the task of ruling the three worlds!-I cannot therefore, instruct you.</p>
<p id='28'>ब्राह्मणस्त्वब्रवीद् राजन् यस्मिन् काले क्षणो भवेत्। तदोपादेष्टुमिच्छामि यदाचयमनुत्तमम्॥<br />The Brahmana said,-O king when you may have leisure, I wish to listen to your instructions about that conduct which yields good!</p>
<p id='29'>ततः प्रीतोऽभवद् राजा प्रह्लादो ब्रह्मवादिनः। तथेत्युक्त्वा शुभे काले ज्ञानतत्त्वं ददौ तदा॥<br />At this answer, king Prahlada became pleased with that Brahmavadin. Saying,-So be it!-he availed of a favourable opportunity for delivering to the Brahma the truths of knowledge.</p>
<p id='30'>ब्राह्मणोऽपि यथान्यायं गुरुवृत्तिमनुत्तमाम्। चकार सर्वभावेन यदस्य मनसेप्सितम्॥<br />The Brahmana duly treated Prahlada as a disciple should his preceptor, and began with his whole heart to do what Prahlada wished.</p>
<p id='31'>पृष्टश्च तेन बहुशः प्राप्तं कथमनुत्तमम्। त्रैलोक्यराज्यं धर्मज्ञ कारणं तद् ब्रवीहि मे। प्रह्लादोऽपि महाराज ब्राह्मणं वाक्यमब्रवीत्॥<br />Many a time the Brahmana enquired, saying,O chastiser of enemies by what means have you been able to acquire the sovereignty of the three worlds? Tell me, O pious king, what those means are!-Prahlada, O king, answered the question of the Brahmana.</p>
<p id='32'>प्रह्लाद उवाच नासूयामि द्विजान् विप्र राजास्मीति कदाचन। काव्यानि वदतां तेषां संयच्छामि वहामि च॥<br />Prahlada said I do not, O twice-born one, feel any pride for my being a king, nor do I entertain any hostile feeling towards the Brahmanas! On the other hand, I accept and follow the policy they describe to me based upon the teachings of Shukra.</p>
<p id='33'>ते विश्रब्धाः प्रभाषन्ते संयच्छन्ति च मां सदा। ते मां काव्यपथे युक्तं शुश्रूषुमनसूयकम्॥<br />Full confident they say to me what they wish to say, and restrain me from unrighteous or improper courses. I am ever obedient to the teachings of Shukra. I wait upon and serve the Brahmanas and my elders. I bear no malice.</p>
<p id='34'>धर्मात्मानं जितक्रोधं नियतं संयतेन्द्रियम्। समासिञ्चन्ति शास्तारः क्षौद्रं मध्विव मक्षिकाः॥<br />I am of righteous soul. I have conquered anger. I am self-controlled, and all my senses are under restraint. Those twice-born ones that are my instructors give me wholesome advice like bees dropping honey into the cells of their comb.</p>
<p id='35'>सोऽहं वागाविद्यानां रसानामवलेहिता। स्वजात्यानधितिष्ठामि नक्षत्राणीव चन्द्रमाः॥<br />I taste the ambrosia dropped by those learned men, and like the Moon among the stars I live among the members of my family.</p>
<p id='36'>एतत् पृथिव्याममृतमेतच्चक्षुरनुत्तमम्। यद् ब्राह्मणमुखे काव्यमेतच्छुत्वा प्रवर्तते॥<br />Even listening to the teachings of Shukra from the lips of Brahmanas and following them in practise, is this nectar on Earth, even this is the clearest eye.</p>
<p id='37'>एतावच्छ्रेय इत्याह प्रह्लादो ब्रह्मवादिनम्। शुश्रूषितस्तेन तदा दैत्येन्द्रो वाक्यमब्रवीत्॥ यथावद् गुरुवृत्त्या ते प्रीतोऽस्मि द्विजसत्तमा वरं वृणीष्व भद्रं ते प्रदातास्मि न संशयः॥<br />The good of a man consists in these, Thus said Prahlada to that utterer of Brahma. Served dutifully by him, the chief of the Asuras once more said,-O foremost of twice-born ones, I am highly pleased with you for your dutiful conduct towards me. Ask of me the boon you wish, blessed be you, for I shall grant you what you will ask.</p>
<p id='38'>कृतमित्येव दैत्येन्द्रमुवाच स च वै द्विजः। प्रह्लादस्त्वब्रवीत् प्रीतो गृह्यतां वर इत्युत॥<br />The Brahmana answered the king of the Asuras saying,-Very well. I will obey you.-Prahlada, pleased with him, said,-Take what you wish.</p>
<p id='39'>ब्राह्मण उवाच यदि राजन् प्रसन्नस्त्वं मम चेदिच्छसि प्रियम्। भवतः शीलमिच्छामि प्राप्तुमेष वरो मम॥<br />The Brahmana said for. If, O king, you have been pleased with me and if you wish to do what is agreeable to me, I wish then to acquire your behaviour? This is the boon that I pray</p>
<p id='40'>ततः प्रीतस्तु दैत्येन्द्रो भयमस्याभवन्महत्। वरे प्रदिष्टे विप्रेण नाल्पतेजायमित्युत॥<br />At this, though pleased, Prahlada became stricken with a great fear. Indeed when this boon was indicated by the Brahmana, the Asura king thought that the solicitor could not be an ordinary person.</p>
<p id='41'>एवमस्त्विति स प्राह प्रह्लादो विस्मितस्तदा। उपाकृत्य तु विप्राय वरं दुःखान्वितोऽभवत्॥<br />Wondering much, Prahlada at last said,-Let it be so!-Having, however, granted the boon, the Asura king became filled with grief.</p>
<p id='42'>दत्ते वरे गते विप्रे चिन्ताऽऽसीन्महती तदा। प्रह्लादस्य महाराज निश्चयं न च जग्मिवान्॥<br />Having received the boon, the Brahmana went away, but Prahlada, O king, was stricken with a deep anxiety and knew not what to do.</p>
<p id='43'>तस्य चिन्तयतस्तावच्छायाभूतं महाद्युति। तेजो विग्रहवत् तात शरीरमजहात् तदा॥ तमपृच्छन्महाकायं प्रह्लादः को भवानिति। प्रत्याहतं तु शीलोऽस्मि त्यक्तो गच्छाम्यहं त्वया।॥<br />While the Asura king sat brooding over the matter, a flame of light came out of his person. It had a shadowy form of great effulgence and huge proportions. Prahlada asked the form, saying,-Who are You?-The form answered, saying-—I am the embodiment of your conduct. Renounced by you I am going away.</p>
<p id='44'>तस्मिन् द्विजोत्तमे राजन् वत्स्याम्यहमनिन्दिते। योऽसौ शिष्यत्वमागम्य त्वयि नित्यं समाहितः॥<br />I shall henceforth, O king, dwell in that blameless and foremost of Brahmanas who had become your devoted disciple!-Having said these words, the form vanished and soon after entered the body of Shakra.</p>
<p id='45'>तस्मिंस्तेजसि याते तु तादृगरूपस्ततोऽपरः॥ शरीरानिःसृतस्तस्य को भवानिति चाब्रवीत्।<br />After the disappearance of that form, another of similar form issued out of Prahlada's body. The Daitya king addressing it, said,-Who are you?</p>
<p id='46'>इत्युक्त्वान्तर्हितं तद् वै शक्रं चान्वाविशत् प्रभो। धर्म प्रह्लाद मां विद्धि यत्रासौ द्विजसत्तमः॥ तत्र यास्यामि दैत्येन्द्र यतः शीलं ततो ह्यहम्।<br />The form answered, saying,-Know me, O Prahlada, for the embodiment of Righteousness, I shall go there where that foremost of Brahmanas is, for, o king of the Daityas, I reside there where Conduct lives!</p>
<p id='47'>ततोऽपरो महाराज प्रज्वलन्निव तेजसा॥ शरीरानिःसृतस्तस्य प्रह्लादस्य महात्मनः।<br />Upon the disappearance of Righteousness, a third highly effulgent form, O monarch, issued out of the body of the great Prahlada.</p>
<p id='48'>को भवानिति पृष्टश्च तमाह स महाद्युतिः॥ सत्यं विद्ध्यसुरेन्द्राद्य प्रयास्ये धर्ममन्वहम्।<br />Asked by Prahlada as to who he was, that highly effulgent form answered, sayingKnow, O king of the Daityas, that I am Truth. I shall leave you, following the way of Righteousness!</p>
<p id='49'>तस्मिन्ननुगते सत्ये महान् वै पुरुषोऽपरः॥ निश्चक्राम ततस्तस्मात् पृष्टश्चाह महाबलः। वृत्तं प्रह्लाद मां विद्धि यतः सत्यं ततो ह्यहम्॥<br />After Truth had left Prahlada, following Righteousness, another great person issued out of Prahlada's body. Asked by the Daitya king, the mighty being answered, being answered, I am the embodiment of good works. Know, O Prahlada, that I live there were the Truth lives!</p>
<p id='50'>तस्मिन् गते महाशब्दः शरीरात् तस्य निर्ययौ। पृष्टश्चाह बलं विद्धि यतो वृत्तमहं ततः॥<br />After this one had left Prahlada, another being come out, giving vent to loud and deep cries. Addressed by Prahlada, he answered,-Know that I am Power. I live there where good works are.</p>
<p id='51'>इत्युक्त्वा प्रययौ तत्र यतो वृत्तं नराधिप। ततः प्रभामयी देवी शरीरात् तस्य निर्ययौ॥<br />Having said these words, Power went away where good works had gone. After this, a goddess of great effulgence came out of Prahlada's person.</p>
<p id='52'>तामपृच्छत् दैत्येन्द्रः सा श्रीरित्येनमब्रवीत्। उषितास्मि स्वयं वीर त्वयि सत्यपराक्रम॥ त्वया त्यक्ता गमिष्यामि बलं ह्यनुगता ह्यहम्।<br />The Daitya king asked her and she answered him saying that she was the embodiment of Prosperity, adding,-I lived in you, O hero, O you of prowess incapable of being baffled. Renounced by you, I shall follow Power.</p>
<p id='53'>ततो भयं प्रादुरासीत् प्रह्लादस्य महात्मनः॥ अपृच्छत् स ततो भूयः क्व यासि कमलालये।<br />The great Prahlada, stricken with fear, once more asked the goddess, saying,-Where do you go, O goddess, O you that live amid lotuses?</p>
<p id='54'>त्वं हि सत्यव्रता देवी लोकस्य परमेश्वरी। कश्चासौ ब्राह्मणश्रेष्ठस्तत्त्वमिच्छामि वेदितुम्॥<br />You are ever devoted to truth, O goddess, and you are the foremost of deities. Who is that foremost of Brahmanas? I wish to know the truth!</p>
<p id='55'>श्रीरुवाच स शक्रो ब्रह्मचारी यस्त्वत्तश्चैवोपशिक्षितः। त्रैलोक्ये ते यदैश्वर्यं तत् तेनापहृतं प्रभो॥<br />The goddess of Prosperity said Practising the vow of Brahmacharya, that Brahmana who was instructed by you was Shakra. O foremost one, he robbed you of that sovereignty which you had over the three worlds.</p>
<p id='56'>शीलेन हि त्रयो लोकास्त्वया धर्मज्ञ निर्जिताः। तद्विज्ञाय सुरेन्द्रेण तव शीलं हृतं प्रभो॥<br />O Righteous one, it was by your conduct that you had reduced the three worlds to subjection. Knowing this the king of the gods robbed you of your conduct!</p>
<p id='57'>धर्मः सत्यं तथा वृत्तं बलं चैव तथाप्यहम्। शीलमूला महाप्राज्ञ सदा नास्त्यत्र संशयः॥<br />Righteousness and Truth and good works and Power and myself, O you of great wisdom, all originate from conduct.</p>
<p id='58'>भीष्म उवाच एवमुक्त्वा गता श्रीस्तु ते च सर्वे युधिष्ठिर। दुर्योधनस्तु पितरं भूय एवाब्रवीद् वचः॥<br />Bhishma said Having said these words, the goddess of Prosperity went away, as also all the rest, O Yudhishthira. Once more addressing his father.</p>
<p id='59'>शीलस्य तत्त्वमिच्छामि वेत्तुं कौरवनन्दन। प्राप्यते च यथा शीलं तं चोपायं वदस्व मे॥<br />Duryodhana said O delighter of the Kurus, I wish to know the truth about conduct. Tell me the means by which it may be acquired.</p>
<p id='60'>धृतराष्ट्र उवाच सोपायं पूर्वमुद्दिष्टं प्रह्लादेन महात्मना। संक्षेपेण तु शीलस्य शृणु प्राप्तिं नरेश्वर॥<br />Dhritarashtra said Those means were described by the great Prahlada while discoursing to Indra. Listen, however, O king, as to how in brief conduct may be acquired.</p>
<p id='61'>अद्रोहः सर्वभूतेषु कर्मणा मनसा गिरा। अनुग्रहश्च दानं च शीलमेतत् प्रशस्यते॥<br />Abstention from injury, by act, thought, and word to all creatures, mercy, and gift, constitute the praise-worthy behaviour.</p>
<p id='62'>यदन्येषां हितं न स्यादात्मनः कर्म पौरुषम्। अपत्रपेत वा येन न तत् कुर्यात् कथंचन॥<br />That act or exertion which does not do good to other, or that act for which one has to feel shame, should never be done.</p>
<p id='63'>तत्तु कर्म तथा कुर्याद् येन श्लाध्येत संसदि। शीलं समासेनैतत् ते कथितं कुरुसत्तम॥<br />That act, on the other hand, should be done for which one may be lauded in society. O best of the Kurus, I have now told you briefly as to what conduct is.</p>
<p id='64'>यद्यप्यशीला नृपते प्राप्नुवन्ति श्रियं क्वचित्। न भुञ्जते चिरं तात समूलाश्च न सन्ति ते॥<br />If, O king, wicked persons do ever acquire prosperity, they do not enjoy it long, O son, and are soon rooted out.</p>
<p id='65'>एतद् विदित्वा तत्त्वेन शीलवान् भव पुत्रका यदीच्छसि श्रियं तात सुविशिष्टां युधिष्ठिरात्॥<br />Dhritarashtra said Knowing all this truly, do you, O son, be of good conduct, if you wish to obtain greater prosperity than Yudhishthira.'</p>
<p id='66'>भीष्म उवाच एतत् कथितवान् पुत्रे धृतराष्ट्रो नराधिपः। एतत् कुरुष्व कौन्तेय ततः प्राप्स्यसि तत्फलम्॥<br />Bhishma said This was what king Dhritarashtra said to his son. Do you follow these instructions, O son of Kunti, and you will then surely acquire their fruit.</p>
