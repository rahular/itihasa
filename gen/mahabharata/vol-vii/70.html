He should have faith. He should earn wealth without persecution and cruelty. He should seek pleasure without attachment.</p>

He should never employ persons who are not devoted to him as his spies and secret emissaries. He should never accomplish his works by oppression.</p>

He should be clever in business but should always wait for the opportune moment. He should solace men and never send them away with empty words. Having favoured a person, he should not case him off.</p>

He should display anger, but should never do so when there is no occasion. He should be mild, but never to the offenders.</p>

<p id='14'>वैशम्पायन उवाच इदं वचः शान्तनवस्य शुश्रुवान् युधिष्ठिरः पाण्डवमुख्यसंवृतः। तदा ववन्दे च पितामहं नृपो यथोक्तमेतच्च चकार बुद्धिमान्॥<br />Vaishampayana said Hearing these words of Shantanu's son, king Yudhishthira, always obedient in receiving instructions, endued with great intelligence, and protected by Bhima and others, then adored his grandfather and from that time began to rule according to his dictates.</p>
