<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 2</h3><h4>The account of Karna's life. Drona's curse-Karna becomes Rama's pupil</h4><p id='1'>वैशम्पायन उवाच स एवमुक्तस्तु मुनि रदो वदतां वरः। कथयामास तत् सर्वं यथा शप्तः स सूतजः॥<br />Thus accosted that best of orators, viz., the sage Narada, described everything about the manner in which he who was known as a charioteers' son had been cursed.</p>
<p id='2'>नारद उवाच एवमेतन्महाबाहो यथा वदसि भारत। न कर्णार्जुनयोः किंचिदविषह्यं भवेद् रणे॥<br />Narada said "What you say, O mighty-armed one, is true O Bharata! Nothing could resist Karna and Arjuna in battle.</p>
<p id='3'>गुह्यमेतत् तु देवानां कथयिष्यामि तेऽनघ। तन्निबोध महाबाहो यथा वृत्तमिदं पुरा॥<br />This, O sinless one, that I am about to tell you is unknown to the very celestials. Listen to me, O mighty-armed one, as it happened formerly.</p>
<p id='4'>क्षत्रं स्वर्ग कथं गच्छेच्छस्त्रपूतमिति प्रभो। संघर्षजननस्तस्मात् कन्यागर्भो विनिर्मितः॥<br />The question was mooted, how all the Kshatriyas, purified by weapons, should attain to blissful regions. For this, a child was conceived by Kunti while she was a maid, capable of creating a general war.</p>
<p id='5'>स बालस्तेजसा युक्तः सूतपुत्रत्वमागतः। चकाराङ्गिरसां श्रेष्ठाद् धनुर्वेदं गुरोस्तदा॥<br />Highly energetic that child became known as a Suta. He subsequently learnt the science of arms from the preceptor (Drona), that foremost of Angirasa's race.</p>
<p id='6'>स बलं भीमसेनस्य फाल्गुनस्य च लाघवम्। बुद्धिं च तव राजेन्द्र यमयोर्विनयं तदा॥ सख्यं च वासुदेवेन बाल्ये गाण्डीवधन्वनः। प्रजानामनुरागं च चिन्तयानो व्यदह्यत॥<br />Thinking of the prowess of Bhimasena, the quickness of Arjuna in the use of arms, your intelligence, O King, the humility of the twins, the friendship, from earliest years, between Vasudeva and the holder of Gandiva, and the love of the people for you all, that young man was burnt with envy.</p>
<p id='7'>स सख्यमकरोद् बाल्ये राज्ञा दुर्योधनेन च। युष्माभिनित्यसंद्विष्टो दैवाच्चापि स्वभावतः॥<br />In early age he contracted friendship with king Duryodhana, led by accident and his own nature and the hate he cherished against you all.</p>
<p id='8'>वीर्याधिकमथालक्ष्य धनुर्वेदे धनंजयम्। द्रोणं रहस्युपागम्य कर्णो वचनमब्रवीत्॥ ब्रह्मास्त्रं वेत्तुमिच्छामि सरहस्यनिवर्तनम्। अर्जुनेन समं चाहं युध्येयमिति मे मतिः॥<br />Making that Dhananjaya was superior to every one in the science of arms, Karna one day approached Drona privately and said these words to him,-I desire to master the Brahma weapon, with all its Mantras and the power of withdrawing it, for I wish to fight Arjuna.</p>
<p id='9'>समः शिष्येषु वः स्नेहः पुत्रे चैव तथा ध्रुवम्। त्वत्प्रसादान्न मां ब्रूयुरकृतास्त्रं विचक्षणाः॥<br />Forsooth, the love you bear for every one of your pupils is equal to what you cherish for your own son! I pray that all masters of the science of arms may, by your favour consider me as one accomplished in weapons.</p>
<p id='10'>द्रोणस्तथोक्तः कर्णेन सापेक्षः फाल्गुनं प्रति। दौरात्म्यं चैव कर्णस्य विदित्वा तमुवाच ह॥ ब्रह्मास्त्रं ब्राह्मणो विद्याद् यथावच्चरितव्रतः। क्षत्रियो वा तपस्वी यो नान्यो विद्यात् कथंचन।॥<br />Thus accosted by him, Drona, on account of partial love for Phalguna, as also from his knowledge of the wickedness of Karna, told him,-None save a Brahmana, who has duly practised all vows, should master the Brahma weapon, or a Kshatriya who has practised austere penances, and no other.</p>
<p id='11'>इत्युक्तोऽङ्गिरसां श्रेष्ठमामन्त्र्य प्रतिपूज्य च। जगाम सहसा रामं महेन्द्रं पर्वतं प्रति॥<br />When Drona had answered thus, Karna, having adored him, took his permission and proceeded forthwith to Rama then living on the Mahendra mountains.</p>
<p id='12'>स तु राममुपागम्य शिरसाऽभिप्रणम्य च। ब्राह्मणो भार्गवोऽस्मीति गौरवेणाभ्यगच्छत॥<br />Approaching Rama, hc bowed to him and said,-I am a Brahmana of Bhrigu's race!-This secured honour for him.</p>
<p id='13'>समस्तं प्रतिजग्राह पृष्ट्वा गोत्रादि सर्वशः। उष्यतां स्वागतं चेति प्रीतिमांश्चाभवद् भृशम्॥<br />With this knowledge about his birth and family, Rama received him kindly and said, You are welcome!-at which Karna became highly pleased.</p>
<p id='14'>तत्र कर्णस्य वसतो महेन्द्रे स्वर्गसंनिभे। गन्धर्व राक्षसैर्यक्षैर्देवैश्चासीत् समागमः॥<br />While living on the Mahendra mountains resembling heaven itself, Karna met and mixed with many Gandharvas, and Yakshas, and gods.</p>
<p id='15'>स तत्रेष्वस्त्रमकरोद् भृगुश्रेष्ठाद् यथाविधि। प्रियश्चाभवदत्यर्थं देवदानवरक्षसाम्॥<br />While living there, he learnt the use of all the weapons duly, and became a great favourite of the gods, the Gandharvas, and the Rakshasas.</p>
<p id='16'>स कदाचित् समुद्रान्ते विचरन्नाश्रमान्तिके। एकः खड्गधनुष्पाणिः परिचक्राम सूर्यजः॥<br />One day he walked on the sea shore by the side of that hermitage. Armed with bow and sword, Surya's son wandered alone.</p>
<p id='17'>सोऽग्निहोत्रप्रसक्तस्य कस्यचिद् ब्रह्मवादिनः। जघानाज्ञानतः पार्थ होमधेनुं यदृच्छया।॥<br />While thus walking, O Partha, he inadvertently and unwittingly killed the Homa Cow of a certain Brahmavadin who daily performed his Agnihotra rite.</p>
<p id='18'>तदज्ञानकृतं मत्वा ब्राह्मणाय न्यवेदयत्। कर्णः प्रसादयंश्चैनमिदमित्यब्रवीद् वचः॥ अबुद्धिपूर्वं भगवन् धेनुरेषा हता तव। मया तत्र प्रसादं च कुरुष्वेति पुनः पुनः॥ तं स विप्रोऽब्रवीत्क्रुद्धो वाचा निर्भर्त्सयन्निव। दुराचार वधार्हस्त्वं फलं प्रात्नुहि दुर्मते॥<br />Knowing that he had perpetrated that crime from carelessness, he informed the Brahmana of it. For pleasing the owner, Karna repeatedly said,-O Rishi, I have killed this your cow against my will. Forgive the act! Filled with anger the Brahmana, rebuking him, said, O wicked wight, you should be killed! May you suffer the fruit of this act, O you of wicked soul!</p>
<p id='19'>येन विस्पर्धसे नित्यं यदर्थं घटसेऽनिशम्। युध्यतस्तेन ते पाप भूमिश्चक्रं गृसिष्यति॥<br />While fighting him, O wretch, whom you always challenge, and for whom you are trying so much every day, the Earth shall swallow the wheel of your car.</p>
<p id='20'>ततश्चक्रे महीग्रस्ते मूर्धानं ते विचेतसः। पातयिष्यति विक्रम्य शत्रुर्गच्छ नराधम॥<br />And while the wheel of your car shall thus be swallowed up by the Earth, your enemy displaying his prowess, will cut off your head, you being stupefied then. Leave me, O vile man!</p>
<p id='21'>यथेयं गौर्हता मूढ प्रमत्तेन त्वया मम। प्रमत्तस्य तथारातिः शिरस्ते पातयिष्यति॥ शप्तः प्रसादयामास कर्णस्तं द्विजसत्तमम्। गोभिर्घनैश्च रत्नैश्च स चैनं पुनरब्रवीत्॥ न हि मेऽव्याहृतं कुर्यात् सर्वलोकोऽपि केवलम्। गच्छ वा तिष्ठ वा यद् वा कार्यं ते तत् समाच।।२८। इत्युक्तो ब्राह्मणेनाथ कर्णो दैन्यादधोमुखः। राममभ्यगमद् भीतस्तदेव मनसा स्मरन्।॥<br />As you have carelessly killed this my cow, so will your enemy cut off your head while you will be careless!-Though cursed, Karna still tried to gratify that foremost of Brahmanas by offering him kine and wealth and gems. The latter, however, once more answered him,-All the worlds will not falsify the words of mine. Go hence or remain, do what you like.-Thus addressed by the Brahmana, Karna, Handing down his head in depression, returned timidly to Rama."</p>
