<p id='4'>सर्वं वैनयिकं कृत्वा विनयज्ञो बृहस्पतिम्। दक्षिणानन्तरो भूत्वा प्रणम्य विधिपूर्वकम्॥ विधिं पप्रच्छ राज्यस्य सर्वलोकहिते रतः। प्रजानां सुखमन्विच्छन् धर्मशीलं बृहस्पतिम्॥<br />Always humble, king Vasumanas ever devoted to well-being of all, having observed the proper humilities, and having gone round the great sage and bowed to him duly enquired of the virtuous Brihaspati about the institutes of a kingdom, actuated by the desire of securing the happiness of men.</p>
