<p id='2'>वैशम्पायन उवाच कृतोदकास्ते सुहृदां सर्वेषां पाण्डुनन्दनाः। विदुरो धृतराष्ट्रश्च सर्वाश्च भरतस्त्रियः॥ तत्र ते सुमहात्मानो न्यवसन् पाण्डुनन्दनाः। शौचं निवर्तयिष्यन्तो मासमानं बहिः पुरात्॥<br />“Having offered oblations of water to all their friends and kinsmen, the sons of Pandu, Vidura, Dhritarashtra, and all the Bharata ladies, continued to live on the banks of the sacred river. The noble sons of Pandu wished to pass the period of mourning, which lasted for a month, outside the Kuru city.</p>
<p id='3'>कृतोदकं तु राजानं धर्मपुत्रं युधिष्ठिरम्। अभिजग्मुर्महात्मानः सिद्धा ब्रह्मर्षिसत्तमाः॥<br />After king Yudhishthira had performed the water-rites, many great sages endued with ascetic success and many sainted Rishis came there to see the king.</p>
<p id='4'>द्वैपायनो नारदश्च देवलश्च महानृषिः। देवस्थानश्च कण्वश्च तेषां शिष्याश्च सत्तमाः॥<br />Among them were the Dvaipayana Vyasa, Narada, the great Rishi Devala, Devasthana, and Kanva. They had in their company the best of their pupils.</p>
<p id='5'>अन्ये च वेदविद्वांसः कृतप्रज्ञा द्विजातयः। गृहस्थाः स्नातकाः सन्तो ददृशुः कुरुसत्तमम्॥<br />Many other Rishis, of great wisdom and well versed in the Vedic in the Vedic Lore. living as householders or belonging to the Snataka class, came to see the Kuru king.</p>
<p id='6'>तेऽभिगम्य महात्मानः पूजिताश्च यथाविधि। आसनेषु महार्हेषु विविशुस्ते महर्षयः॥ प्रतिगृह्य ततः पूजां तत्कालसदृशीं तदा। पर्युपासन् यथान्यायं परिवार्य युधिष्ठिरम्॥<br />Those high-souled ones, as they came, were duly adored by Yudhishthira. The great Rishis then took their seats on rich carpets. Accepting the adoration suited to the period of mourning, they sat in due order around the king.</p>
<p id='7'>पुण्ये भागीरथीतीरे शोकव्याकुलचेतसम्। आश्वासयन्तो राजानं विप्राः शतसहस्रशः॥<br />Thousands of Brahmanas consoled and comforted that king of kings living on the sacred banks of the Bhagirathi with heart exceedingly shaken by sorrow.</p>
<p id='8'>नारदस्त्वब्रवीत् काले धर्मपुत्रं युधिष्ठिरम्। सम्भाष्य मुनिभिः सार्धं कृष्णद्वैपायनादिभिः॥ भवता बाहुवीर्येण प्रसादान्माधवस्य च। जितेयमवनिः कृत्स्ना धर्मेण च युधिष्ठि॥<br />Having accosted first the Rishis headed by Vyasa, Narada addressed Yudhishthira the son of Dharma, saying, “Through the strength of your arms and the kindness of Krishna, the whole Earth, O Yudhishthira, has been righteously acquired by you.</p>
<p id='9'>दिष्ट्या मुक्तस्तु संग्रामादस्माल्लोकभयंकरात्। क्षत्रधर्मरतश्चापि कच्चिन्मोदसि पाण्डव॥<br />By dint of good fortune, you have escaped alive from this dreadful battle. Ever abiding by the duties of a Kshatriya, why do you not rejoice, O son of Pandu?</p>
<p id='10'>कच्चिच्च निहतामित्रः प्रीणासि सुहृदो नृप। कच्चिच्छ्रियमिमां प्राप्य न त्वां शोकः प्रबाधते॥<br />Having killed all you foes, will you not please your friends, O King? Having secured this prosperity, I hope, you have nothing to be sorry of now.'."</p>
<p id='11'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच विजितेयं मही कृत्स्ना कृष्णबाहुबलाश्रयात्। ब्राह्मणानां प्रसादेन भीमार्जुनबलेन च॥<br />Yudhishthira said Indeed, I have conquered the whole Earth through my reliance on the might of Krishna's arms, through the favour of the Brahmanas, and through the strength of Bhima and Arjuna.</p>
<p id='12'>इदं मम महद् दुःखं वर्तते हृदि नित्यदा। कृत्वा ज्ञातिक्षयमिमं महान्तं लोभकारितम्॥ सौभद्रं द्रौपदेयांश्च घातयित्वा सुतान् प्रियान्। जयोऽयमजयाकारो भगवन् प्रतिभाति मे॥<br />But his heavy grief, is always preying on my mind, that through covetousness I have brought about this dreadful destruction of kinsmen. Having caused the death of the darling son of Subhadra, and of the sons of Draupadi, this victory, O Holy one, appears to me as being tantamount to defeat.</p>
<p id='13'>किं नु वक्ष्यति वार्ष्णेयी वधूर्मे मधुसूदनम्। द्वारकावासिनी कृष्णमितः प्रतिगतं हरिम्॥<br />What will Subhadra of Vrishni's race, that sister-in-law of mine, say to me? what also will the inhabitants of Dwaraka say to the destroyer of Madhu when he goes there from this place?</p>
<p id='14'>द्रौपदी हतपुत्रेयं कृपणा हतबान्धवा। अस्मत्प्रियहिते युक्ता भूयः पीडयतीव माम्॥<br />This Draupadi, again, who is eve busy with pleasing us, bereaved of son and kinsmen, is causing me great pain.</p>
<p id='15'>इदमन्यत् तु भगवन् यत् त्वां वक्ष्यामि नारद। मन्त्रसंवरणेनास्मि कुन्त्या दुःखेन योजितः॥<br />There is another subject, O holy Narada, about which I will speak to you. For Kunti having hidden a very important matter, great has been my grief.</p>
<p id='16'>यः स नागायुतबलो लोकेऽप्रतिरथो रणे। सिंहखेलगतिर्धीमान् घृणी दाता यतव्रतः॥ आश्रयो धार्तराष्ट्राणां मानी तीक्ष्णपराक्रमः। अमर्षी नित्यसंरम्भी क्षेप्तास्माकं रणे रणे।॥ शीघ्रास्त्रश्चित्रयोधी च कृती चाद्भुतविक्रमः। गूढोत्पन्नः सुतः कुन्त्या भ्रातास्माकमसौ किल॥<br />That hero who had the strength of ten thousand elephants, who in this world was peerless car-warrior, who was endued with the pride and gait of a lion, who was gifted with great intelligence and compassion, whose liberality was unbounded, who practised many high vows, who was the refuge of the Dhartarashtras, who was sensitive about his honour, whose prowess was irresistible, who was ready to repay all injuries and was always wrathful [in battle], who defeated us in various encounters, who was quick in the use of arms, conversant with every mode of battle, skilful and endued with wonderful courage, that Karna was a son of Kunti, given birth to by her .secretly, and, therefore, a uterine brother of ours.</p>
<p id='17'>तोयकर्मणि तं कुन्ती कथयामास सूर्यजम्। पुत्रं सर्वगुणोपेतमवकीर्णं जले पुरा॥<br />Whilst we were offering oblations of water to the dead, Kunti described him as the son of Surya (Sun-God). Possessed of every accomplishment, that child had been thrown into the water.</p>
<p id='18'>मञ्जूषायां समाधाय गङ्गास्रोतस्यमज्जयत्। यं सूतपुत्रं लोकोऽयं राधेयं चाभ्यमन्यत॥ स ज्येष्ठपुत्रः कुन्त्या वै भ्रातास्माकं च मातृजः। अजानता मया भ्रात्रा राज्यलुब्धेन घातितः॥ तन्मे दहति गात्राणि तूलराशिमिवानलः।<br />Having placed him in a basket made of grass, Kunti Floated it in the water of Ganga. He who was known to the world as the son of the charioteer Radha, was really the eldest son of Kunti, and, therefore, our uterine brother! Hankering after kingdom, alas, I have unknowingly brought about the death of that brother of mine. It is this that is burning my body, like a fire consuming a heap of cotton.</p>
<p id='19'>न हि तं वेद पार्थोऽपि भ्रातरं श्वेतवाहनः॥ नाहं न भीमो न यमौ स त्वस्मान् वेद सुव्रतः।<br />Arjuna having white horses knew him not for a brother! Neither I, Nor Bhima, Nor the twins, knew him as such! He, however, a great bowman knew us (for his brothers).</p>
<p id='20'>गता किल पृथा तस्य सकाशमिति नः श्रुतम्॥ अस्माकं शमकामा वै त्वं च पुत्रो ममेत्यथ।<br />We have heard that once Pritha went to him for seeking our well-being and addressed him, saying, You are my son.</p>
<p id='21'>पृथाया न कृतः कामस्तेन चापि महात्मना॥ अपि पश्चादिदं मातर्यवोचदिति नः श्रुतम्।<br />That illustrious hero, however, refused to satisfy Pritha's desire. Subsequently, we are informed, he said to his mother these words:न हि शक्ष्याम्यहं त्यत्वें नृपं दुर्योधनं रणे॥</p>
<p id='22'>अनार्यत्वं नृशंसत्वं कृतघ्नत्वं च मे भवेत्।<br />I am unable to leave Duryodhana's side in battle! If I do so, it would be a dishonourable, crucl, and ungrateful act.</p>
<p id='23'>युधिष्ठिरेण संधिं हि यदि कुर्या मते तव॥ भीतो रणे श्वेतवाहादिति मां मंस्यते जनः।<br />If, in pursuance of your wishes, I make peace with Yudhishthira, people will say that I ani afraid of Arjuna having white horses.</p>
<p id='24'>सोऽहं निर्जित्य समरे विजयं सहकेशवम्॥ संधास्ये धर्मपुत्रेण पश्चादिति च सोऽब्रवीत्।<br />Having defeated Arjuna with Keshava, therefore, in battle, I will afterwards make peace with Dharma's son! These were his words as we have heard.</p>
<p id='25'>तमुवाच किल पृथा पुनः पृथुलवक्षसम्॥ चतुर्णामभयं देहि कामं युध्यस्व फाल्गुनम्।<br />Thus answered, Pritha once more addressed her son having broad chest and said,-'Fight with Phalguna then, but spare my four other sons.</p>
<p id='26'>सोऽब्रवीन्मातरं धीमान् वेपमानां कृताञ्जलिः॥ प्राप्तान् विषह्यांश्चतुरो न हनिष्यामि ते सुतान्।<br />The intelligent Karna, with joined palms then replied to his trembling mother, saying,-'If I get your four other sons even under my power, I will not kill them.</p>
<p id='27'>पञ्चैव हि सुता देवि भविष्यन्ति तव ध्रुवाः॥ सार्जुना वा हते कर्णे सकर्णा वा हतेऽर्जुने।<br />Forsooth, O goddess, you will always have five sons! If Karna be killed with Arjuna, You will have five! If, on the other hand, Arjuna be killed, You will have five, with me.'</p>
<p id='28'>तं पुत्रगृद्धिनी भूयो माता पुत्रमथाब्रवीत्॥ भ्रातृणां स्वस्ति कुर्वीथा येषां स्वस्ति चिकीर्षसि।<br />Seeking the well-being of her children, his mother once more said to him,-'Go, O Karna, do good to those brothers of yours whose good you always seek.'</p>
<p id='29'>एवमुक्त्वा किल पृथा विसृज्योपययौ गृहान्॥ सोऽर्जुनेन हतो वीरो भ्रात्रा भ्राता सहोदरः।<br />Having said these words, Pritha took his leave and returned to her residence. That hero has been killed by Arjuna,-the uterine brother by the brother.</p>
<p id='30'>न चैव विवृतो मन्त्रः पृथायास्तस्य वा विभो॥ अथ शूरो महेष्वासः पार्थेनाजौ निपातितः।<br />Neither Pritha, nor he, had ever divulged the secret, O Sir! That hero and great bowman, was therefore killed by Arjuna in battle.</p>
<p id='31'>अहं त्वज्ञासिषं पश्चात् स्वसोदर्यं द्विजोत्तम॥ पूर्वजं भ्रातरं कर्णं पृथाया वचनात् प्रभो।<br />Afterwards I have come to know, O best of Rishis, that he was my uterine brother! Indeed, according to Pritha's words, I am informed that Karna was our eldest-born.</p>
<p id='32'>तेन मे दूयते तीव्र हृदयं भ्रातृघातिनः॥ कर्णार्जुनसहायोऽहं जयेयमपि वासवम्।<br />Having caused my brother to be killed, my heart is burning greatly. If I had both Karna and Arjuna for helping me, I could have defeated Vasudeva himself.</p>
<p id='33'>सभायां क्लिश्यमानस्य धार्तराष्ट्रैर्दुरात्मभिः॥ सहसोत्पतितः क्रोधः कर्णं दृष्ट्वा प्रशाम्यति।<br />Whilst I was tormented in the court by the wicked sons of Dhritarashtra, my anger suddenly excited, became cooled on seeing Karma.</p>
<p id='34'>यदा ह्यस्य गिरो रूक्षाः शृणोमि कटुकोदयाः॥ सभायां गदतो द्यूते दुर्योधनहितैषिणः। तदा नश्यति मे रोषः पादौ तस्य निरीक्ष्य ह॥ कुन्त्या हि सदृशौ पादौ कर्णस्येति मतिर्ममा<br />Even while hearing the harsh and bitter words of Karna himself on the occasion of our match at dice, which he uttered for pleasing Duryodhana, my wrath became cooled on seeing Karna's feet. It appeared to me that Karna's feet resembled the feet of our mother Kunti.</p>
<p id='35'>सादृश्यहेतुमन्विच्छन् पृथायास्तस्य चैव ह॥ कारणं नाधिगच्छामि कथंचिदपि चिन्तयन्।<br />To make out the reason of that resemblance between him and our mother, I thought for a long time. Even trying my level best I could not find the cause.</p>
<p id='36'>कथं नु तस्य संग्रामे पृथिवी चक्रमग्रसत्॥ कथं नु शप्तो भ्राता मे तत्त्वं वक्तुमिहार्हसि।<br />Why, indeed, did the Earth swallow up the wheels of his car at the time of battle? Why was my brother cursed? You should relate all this to me.</p>
<p id='37'>श्रोतुमिच्छामि भगवंस्त्वत्तः सर्वं यथातथम्। भवान् हि सर्वविद् विद्वान् लोके वेद कृताकृतम्।।४४।<br />I wish to hear everything from you, O Rishi. You know everything of this world, as also of both the past and the future.</p>
