Feeling at the same time a great curiosity, he looked at Rajadharman without being able to with draw his eyes from him.</p>
<p id='2'>राजधर्मोवाच भोः कश्यपस्य पुत्रोऽहं माता दाक्षायणी च मे। अतिथिस्त्वं गुणोपेतः स्वागतं ते द्विजोत्तम॥<br />Rajadharman said O Brahmana, I am the son of Kashyapa by one of the daughters of (the sage) Dhaksha. Highly meritorious as you are, you are my guest to-day! You are welcome, O foremost of Brahmana.</p>
<p id='3'>भीष्म उवाच तस्मै दत्त्वा स सत्कारं विधिदृष्टेन कर्मणा। शालपुष्मयीं दिव्यां बृसीं वै समकल्पयत्।॥<br />Bhishma said Having offered him hospitality according to the scriptural rites, the crane made an excellent bed of the Shala flowers that lay all around.</p>
<p id='4'>भगीरथरथाक्रान्तदेशान् गङ्गानिषेवितान्। ये चरन्ति महामीनास्तांश्च तस्यान्वकल्पयत्॥<br />He also gave him several large fishes caught from the deep waters of the Bhagirathi.</p>
<p id='5'>वह्निं चापि सुसंदीप्तं मीनांश्चापि सुपीवरान्। स गौतमायातिथये न्यवेदयत काश्यपिः॥<br />Indeed, the son of Kashyapa offered for the acceptance of his guest Gautama a burning fire and certain large fishes.</p>
<p id='6'>भुक्तवन्तं च तं विप्रं प्रीतात्मानं महातपाः। क्लमापनयनार्थं स पक्षाभ्यामभ्यवीजयत्॥<br />After the Brahmana had eaten and became satisfied, the bird having asceticism for his wealth began to fan him with his wings for removing his fatigue.</p>
<p id='7'>ततो विश्रान्तमासीनं गोत्रप्रश्नमपृच्छत। सोऽब्रवीद् गौतमोऽस्मीति ब्रह्म नान्यदुदाहरत्॥<br />Seeing his guest seated at his ease, he asked him about his birth. The man answered, saying, I am a Brahmana by the name of Gautama!-and then became silent.</p>
<p id='8'>तस्मै पर्णमयं दिव्यं दिव्यपुष्पाधिवासितम्। गन्धाढ्यं शयनं प्रादात् स शिश्ये तत्र वै सुखम्॥<br />The bird offered his guest a soft bed made of leaves and perfumed with many sweetscented flowers. Gautama lay on it, and felt great happiness.</p>
<p id='9'>अथोपविष्टं शयने गौतमं धर्मराट् तदा। पप्रच्छ काश्यपो वाग्मी किमागमनकारणम्॥<br />When Gautama had laid himself down, the eloquent son of Kashyapa, who was like Yama himself in his knowledge of duties, asked him about the cause of his arrival there.</p>
<p id='10'>तोऽब्रवीद् गौतमस्तं दरिद्रोऽहं महामते। समुद्रगमनाकाङ्क्षी द्रव्यार्थमिति भारत॥<br />Gautama answered him, saying, I am, O great one, very poor. For acquiring riches I wish to go to the sea.</p>
<p id='11'>तं काश्यपोऽबवीत् प्रीतो नोत्कण्ठां कर्तुमर्हसि। कृतकार्यो द्विजश्रेष्ठ सद्रव्यो यास्यसे गृहान्॥<br />The son of Kashyapa cheerfully told him,You should not feel any anxiety. You shall succeed, O foremost of Brahmanas, and shall return home with property.</p>
<p id='12'>चतुर्विधा ह्यर्थसिद्धिवृहस्पतिमतं यथा। पारम्पर्य तथा दैवं काम्यं मैत्रमिति प्रभो॥<br />The sage Brihaspati has mentioned four kinds of expedients for the acquisition of wealth, viz., inheritance, sudden acquisition due to good luck or the favour of the gods, acquisition by labour, and acquisition through the help or kindness of friends.</p>
<p id='13'>प्रादुर्भूतोऽस्मि ते मित्रं सुहत्त्वं च मम त्वयि। सोऽहं तथा यतिष्यामि भविष्यसि यथार्थवान्॥<br />I have become your friend. I entertain good feelings towards you! I shall, therefore, try in such a way that you may acquire wealth.</p>
<p id='14'>ततः प्रभातसमये सुखं दृष्ट्वाब्रवीदिदम्। गच्छ सौम्य पथानेन कृतकृत्यो भविष्यसि॥<br />The night passed away and morning came. Seeing his guest rise cheerfully from bed, the bird said, Go, O amiable one, along this very path and you are sure to succeed.</p>
<p id='15'>इतस्त्रियोजनं गत्वा राक्षसाधिपतिर्महान्। विरूपाक्ष इति ख्यातः सखा मम महाबलः॥<br />At the distance of about three Yojanas from this place, there is a powerful king of the Rakshasas. Highly strong as he is, his name is Virupaksha, and he is a friend of mine.</p>
<p id='16'>तं गच्छ द्विजमुख्यं त्वं स मद्वाक्यप्रचोदितः। कामानभीप्सितांस्तुभ्यं दाता नास्त्यत्र संशयः॥<br />Go to him, O foremost of Brahmanas! That chief, at my request, will, forsooth, give you as much wealth as you wish to have.</p>
<p id='17'>इत्युक्तः प्रययौ राजन् गौतमो विगतक्लमः। फलान्यमृतकल्पानि भक्षयन् स यथेतः॥<br />Thus addressed, O king, Gautama cheerfully started from that place, eating on the way, to his best satisfaction, fruits sweet as nectar.</p>
<p id='18'>चन्दनागुरुमुख्यानि त्वक्पत्राणां वनानि च। तस्मिन् पथि महाराज सेवमानो द्रुतं ययौ॥<br />Seeing the sandal and aloe and birch trees that stood along the road, and enjoying their refreshing shade, the Brahmana went on quickly.</p>
<p id='19'>ततो मेरुव्रजं नाम नगरं शैलतोरणम्। शैलप्राकारवप्रं च शैलयन्त्राकुलं तथा॥<br />He then reached the city of Meruvraja. It had lare porches made of stone, and high stone walls. It was also girted on all sides with a ditch, and large pieces of rock and engines of many kinds were kept in readiness on the ramparts.</p>
<p id='20'>विदितश्चाभवत् तस्य राक्षसेन्द्रस्य धीमतः। प्रहितः सुहृदा राजन् प्रीयमाण: प्रियातिथिः॥<br />He soon became known to the highly intelligent Rakshasa chief O king, as a dear guest sent to him by the chief's friend (the crane). The chief received Gautama very gladly.</p>
<p id='21'>ततः स राक्षसेन्द्रः स्वान् प्रेष्यानाह युधिष्ठिर। गौतमो नगरद्वाराच्छीघ्रमानीयतामिति॥<br />The king of the Rakshasas then, O Yudhishthira, ordered his attendants, saying,Bring Gautama soon here from the gate.</p>
<p id='22'>ततः पुरवरात् तस्मात् पुकषा: श्येनचेष्टनाः। गौतमेत्यभिभाषन्तः पुरद्वारमुपागमन्॥<br />At the behest of the king, certain persons, quick as hawks, went out from the splendid palace of their ruler, and proceeding to the gate accosted Gautama.</p>
<p id='23'>ते तमूचुर्महाराज राजप्रेष्यास्तदा द्विजम्। त्वरस्व तूर्णमागच्छ राजा त्वां द्रष्टुमिच्छति॥<br />The royal messengers, O monarch, said to that Brahmana,-Come quickly, the king wishes to see you.</p>
<p id='24'>राक्षसाधिपतिर्वीरो विरूपाक्ष इति श्रुतः। स त्वां त्वरति वै द्रष्टुं तत् क्षिप्रं संविधीयताम्॥<br />You may have heard of the king of the Rakshasas, Virupaksha by name, endued with great courage. He is impatient of seeing you! Come quickly and delay not.</p>
<p id='25'>ततः स प्राद्रवद् विप्रो विस्मयाद् विगलक्लमः। गौतमः परमधिं तां पश्यन् परमविस्मितः॥<br />Thus accosted, the Brahmana, forgetting is exhaustion in his surprise, ran with the messengers. Seeing the great prosperity of the city, he was filled with wonder.</p>
<p id='26'>तैरेव सहितो राज्ञो वेश्म तूर्णमुपाद्रवत्। दर्शनं राक्षसेन्द्रस्य काङ्खमाणो द्विजस्तदा।॥<br />He soon entered the king's palace in the company of the messengers, desirous of seeing the king of the Rakshasas.
