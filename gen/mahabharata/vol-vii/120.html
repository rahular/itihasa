<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 12O</h3><h4>An abridgement of royal duties</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच राजवृत्तान्यनेकानि त्वया प्रोक्तानि भारत। पूर्वैः पूर्वनियुक्तानि राजधर्मार्थवेदिभिः॥१॥<br />Yudhishthira said You have, O Bharata, described the many duties of king-craft, which were observed and laid down in days of yore by persons of ancient times conversant with royal duties.</p>
<p id='2'>तदेव विस्तरेणोक्तः पूर्वदृष्टं सतां मतम्। प्रणेयं राजधर्माणां प्रब्रूहि भरतर्षभ॥<br />You have, indeed, described fully those duties as approved by the wise. Do you, however, O foremost of Bharata's race give us an abridgement of the same, so that we may keep it in memory.</p>
<p id='3'>भीष्म उवाच रक्षणं सर्वभूतानामिति क्षात्रं परं मतम्। तद् यथा रक्षणं कुर्यात् तथा शृणु महीपते॥<br />Bhishma said The protection of all creatures is considered the highest duty of the Kshatriya. Listen now to me, o king, as to how the duty of protection to be performed.</p>
<p id='4'>यथा बर्हाणि चित्राणि बिभर्ति भुजगाशनः। तथा बहुविधं राजा रूपं कुर्वीत धर्मवित्॥<br />A king conversant with his duties should put on many forms and the peacock displays plumes of various hues.</p>
<p id='5'>तैक्ष्ण्यं जिह्मत्वमादाल्भ्यं सत्यमार्जवमेव च। मध्यस्थः सत्त्वमातिष्ठंस्तथा वै सुखमृच्छति॥<br />Keenness, crookedness, truth, and sincerity, are the qualities which should be present in him. He should practise impartially the qualities of goodness if he is to acquire happiness.</p>
<p id='6'>यस्मिन्नर्थे हितं यत् स्यात् तद्वर्ण रूपमादिशेत्। बहुरूपस्य राज्ञो हि सूक्ष्मोऽप्यर्थो न सीदति॥<br />He must assume that particular colour or form which is beneficial for the particular object which he tries to achieve. A king who can put on various forms succeeds in achieving even the most subtile objects.</p>
<p id='7'>नित्यं रक्षितमन्त्रः स्याद् यथा मूकः शरच्छिखी। श्लक्ष्णाक्षरतनुः श्रीमान् भवेच्छास्त्रविशारदः॥<br />Dumb like the peacock in autumn, he should keep his counsels close. He should speak little and that little should be sweet. He should be of good features and well-read in the scriptures.</p>
<p id='8'>आपद्वारेषु युक्तः स्याज्जलप्रस्त्रवणेष्विव। शैलवर्षोदकानीव द्विजान् सिद्धान् समाश्रयेत्। अर्थकामः शिखां राजा कुर्याद्धर्मध्वजोपमाम्॥<br />He should always be very careful about those gates through which dangers may come and befall him, like men guarding breaks in embankments through which the waters of large tanks may rush and flood their fields and houses. He should seek the protection of Brahmanas crowned with ascetic success as men seek the refuge of powerful rivers caused by the rain-water deposited within mountain lakes. That king, who wishes to amass riches should act like religious hypocrites who keep Sikha or tuft of hair.</p>
<p id='9'>नित्यमुद्यतदण्डः स्यादाचरेदप्रमादतः। लोके चायव्ययौ दृष्ट्वा बृहवृक्षमिवास्त्रवत्॥<br />The king should always have the rod of Punishment uplifted in his hands. He should always levy taxes carefully after examining the incomes and expenses of his subjects, like men going to a full-grown palmyra for drawing juice.</p>
<p id='10'>जावान् स्यात् स्वयूथ्येषु भौमानि चरणैः क्षिपेत्। जातपक्षः परिस्पन्देत् प्रेक्षेद् वैकल्यमात्मनः॥<br />He should treat equitably his own subjects; cause the crops of his enemies to be crushed by the foot of his cavalry, march against enemies when his own wings have become strong; and mark all the sources of his own weakness.</p>
<p id='11'>दोषान् विवृणुयाच्छत्रोः परपक्षान् विधूनयेत्। काननेष्विव पुष्पाणि बहिरर्थान् समाचरन्॥<br />He should announce the faults of his enemies; crush those who are their partisans; and collect riches from outside like a person plucking flowers from the forest.</p>
<p id='12'>उच्छ्रितान् नाशयेत् स्फीतान् नरेन्द्रानचलोपमान्। श्रयेच्छायामविज्ञातां गुप्तं रणमुपाश्रयेत्॥<br />He should kill those foremost of kings who are puffed up with might and stand with upraised heads like mountains; by bribing the governors of the forests and by ambuscades and sudden attacks.</p>
<p id='13'>प्रावृषीवासितग्रीवो मज्जेत निशि निर्जने। मायूरेण गुणेनैव स्त्रीभिश्चालक्षितश्चरेत्॥<br />Like the peacock in the rains, he should enter his nightly habitations alone and unseen. Indeed, he should enjoy, like the peacock, within his inner apartments, the company of his wives.</p>
<p id='14'>न जह्याच्च तनुत्राणं रक्षेदात्मानमात्मना। चारभूमिष्वभिगतान् पाशांश्च परिवर्जयेत्॥<br />He should not put off his coat of mail. He should himself guard his own self and avoid the nets spread out for him by the spies and secret agents of his enemies.</p>
<p id='15'>प्रणयेद् वापि तां भूमि प्रणश्येद् गहने पुनः। हन्यात्क्रुद्धानतिविषांस्तान् जिह्मगतयोऽहितान्॥ नाशयेद् बलबर्हाणि संनिवासान् निवासयेत्। सदा बर्हिनिभः कामं प्रशस्तं कृतमाचरेत्। सर्वतश्चाददेत् प्रज्ञा पतङ्गं गहनेष्विव॥<br />He should also gain over the spies of his enemies, but destroy them fully when opportunity presents itself. Like the peacocks the king should destroy his powerful and angry foes of crooked policy, and kill their force and drive them away from home. The king should also like the peacocks do what is good to him, and gather wisdom from all sides as they collect insects even from the forest.</p>
<p id='16'>एवं मयूरवद् राजा स्वराज्यं परिपालयेत्। आत्मवृद्धिकरी नीतिं विदधीत विचक्षणः॥<br />An wise and peacock-like king should thus govern his kingdom and pursue a policy which is good for him.</p>
<p id='17'>आत्मसंयमनं बुद्ध्या परबुद्ध्यावधारणम्। बुद्ध्या चात्मगुणप्राप्तिरेतच्छास्त्रनिदर्शनम्॥<br />By dint of his own intelligence, he should determine what he is to do. By consulting with others he should either leave off or conform such resolution. Helped by that intelligence which is sharpened by the scriptures, one can fix his courses of action. Herein consists the utility of the scriptures.</p>
<p id='18'>परं विश्वासयेत् साम्ना स्वशक्तिं चोपलक्षयेत्। आत्मनः परिमर्शेन बुद्धि बुद्ध्या विचारयेत्॥<br />By following the means of conciliation, he should create confidence in the hearts of his enemies. He should show his own strength. By judging of various courses of action in his own mind he should by dint of his own intelligence, make his decision.</p>
<p id='19'>सान्त्वयोगमतिः प्राज्ञः कार्याकार्यप्रयोजकः। निगूढबुद्धेर्धारस्य वक्तव्ये वा कृतं तथा॥<br />The king should be a master of the arts of conciliating policy; he should be endued with wisdom and should be able to do what should be done and avoid the otherwise. A highly wise and intelligent person does not require counsels or instruction.</p>
<p id='20'>स निकृष्टां कथां प्राज्ञो यदि बुद्ध्या बृहस्पतिः। स्वभावमेष्यते तप्तं कृष्णायसमिवोदके॥ अनुयुञ्जीत कृत्यानि सर्वाण्येव महीपतिः। आगमैरुपदिशनि स्वस्य चैव परस्य च॥<br />A wise man, who is endued with the intelligence of Brihaspati, if he incurs obloquy, soon regains his true nature like heated iron dipped in water. A king should perform objects, of his own or of others, according to the injunctions of the scriptures.</p>
<p id='21'>मृदुशीलं तथा प्राज्ञं शूरं चार्थविधानवित्। स्वकर्मणि नियुञ्जीत ये चान्ये च बलाधिकाः॥<br />A king, who knows well the means of acquiring riches, should always engage in his acts such men as are mild by nature and endued with wisdom, courage and great strength.</p>

<p id='24'>व्यवसायं समाधाय सूर्यो रश्मीनिवायतान्। धर्ममेवाभिरक्षेत कृत्वा तुल्ये प्रियाप्रिये॥<br />While settling the claims of litigants, the king, without making any difference between persons who are liked and those who are disliked by him, should preserve justice.</p>
<p id='25'>कुलप्रकृतिदेशानां धर्मज्ञान् मृदुभाषिणः। मध्ये वयसि निर्दोषान् हिते युक्तानविक्लवान्॥ अलुब्धाशिक्षितान् दान्तान् धर्मेषु परिनिष्ठितान्। स्थापयेत् सर्वकार्येषु राजा धर्मार्थरक्षिणः॥<br />The king should appoint in all his offices such men as know very well the characteristics of particular families of the people in general and of various countries; as are mild in words; as are of middle age; as have no shortcomings, as are devoted to good acts; as are never careless; as are free from rapacity; as are possessed of learning and self-control; and as are firm in virtue and always ready to preserve the interests of both virtue and profit.</p>
<p id='26'>एतेन च प्रकारेण कृत्यानामागतिं गतिम्। युक्तः समनुतिष्ठेत तुष्टश्चारैरुपस्कृतः॥<br />In this way, having determined the course of actions and their final ends, the king should accomplish them carefully; and instructed in all matters by his spies, he may live happily.</p>
<p id='27'>अमोघक्रोधहर्षस्य स्वयं कृत्यान्ववेक्षितुः । आत्मप्रत्ययकोशस्य वसुधैव वसुन्धरा॥<br />That king, who never yields to anger and joy without sufficient cause, who looks after all his acts himself, and who superintends his income and expenditure with his own eyes, succeeds in acquiring great wealth from the Earth.</p>

He should never announce what he does. Like an intelligent person milking his cow every day, the king should milk his kingdom everyday.</p>

That king, who is acquainted with duties and who is gifted with intelligence, would never squander what has been stored.</p>

<p id='34'>धृतिर्दाक्ष्यं संयमो बुद्धिरात्मा धैर्य शौर्य देशकालाप्रमादः। अल्पस्य वा बहुनो वा विवृद्धौ धनस्यैतान्यष्ट समिन्धनानि॥ अग्निः स्तोको वर्धतेऽप्याज्यसिक्तो बीजं चैकं रोहसहस्रमेति। आयव्ययौ विपुलौ संनिशाम्य तस्मादल्पं नावमन्येत वित्तम॥<br />Steadiness, cleverness, self-control, intelligence, health, patience, bravery, and attention to the requirements of time and place,-these eight qualities always multiply wealth, be it small or be it much. A little fire, fed with clarified butter, may end into a conflagration. A single seed may produce a thousand trees. A king, therefore, even when he knows that his income and expenditure are great, should not neglect the smaller items.</p>
<p id='35'>बालोऽप्यबालः स्थविरो रिपुर्यः सदा प्रमत्तं पुरुषं निहन्यात्। कालेनान्यस्तस्य मूलं हरेत कालज्ञाता पार्थिवानां वरिष्ठः॥<br />An enemy, whether he be a child, a young man, or an aged one, succeeds in killing a careless person.

For this reason the king should seek the help of an intelligent minister.</p>

Exertion of embodied creatures is governed by intelligence. Exertion, therefore, is the greatest of all things.</p>

Every kind of fault is seen in covetous men. The king, therefore, should never appoint a covetous man as his minister or officer.</p>
