<h3>Rajadharmanushasana Parva: Chapter 19</h3><h4>Yudhishthira's decisions. He holds that it is a mistake to think that there is nothing superior to wealth.</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच वेदाहं तात शास्त्राणि अपराणि पराणि च। उभयं वेदवचनं कुरु कर्म त्यजेति च॥<br />Yudhishthira said I know both the Vedas and the scriptures that lead to the attainment of Brahma. In the Vedas there are both kinds of precepts, viz., those that preach action and those that preach the renouncement of action,</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>आकुलानि च शास्त्राणि हेतुभिश्चिन्तितानि च। निश्चयश्चैव यो मन्त्रे वेदाहं तं यथाविधि॥<br />The scriptures are conflicting and their conclusions are based upon reasons. The truth of the mantras is duly known to me.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>त्वं तु केवलमस्त्रज्ञो वीरव्रतसमन्वितः। शास्त्रार्थं तत्त्वतो गन्तुं न समर्थः कथंचन॥<br />You are conversant only with weapons and the practices of heroes. You are unable to understand correctly the meaning of the scriptures.</p>

<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>युद्धशास्त्रविदेव त्वं न वृद्धाः सेवितास्त्वया। संक्षिप्तविस्तरविदां न तेषां वेत्सि निश्चयम्॥ तपस्त्यागोऽविधिरिति निश्चयस्त्वेष धीमताम्। परं परं ज्याय एषां येषां नैश्रेयसी मतिः॥<br />You are, a master of the science of battle, but you have never waited upon the aged. You know not the conclusions arrived at by those that have studied the subject briefly and fully. The conclusion of intelligent men who want salvation, is that of ascetic penances, renunciation, and knowledge of Brahma, the second is superior to the first, and the third is superior to the second.</p>
