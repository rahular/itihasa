<h3>APADDHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 138</h3><h4>How should a king act when attacked by any enemies, with whom should he make war</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच सर्वत्र बुद्धिः कथिता श्रेष्ठा ते भरतर्षभ। अनागता तथोत्पन्ना दीर्घसूत्रा विनाशिनी॥<br />Yudhishthira said You have, O foremost of Bharata's race, said that, that intelligence which provides for the future, as well as that which can meet present difficulties, is always superior, while idleness brings about destruction.</p>
<p id='2'>तदिच्छामि परां श्रोतुं बुद्धिं ते भरतर्षभ। यथा राजा न मुह्येत शत्रुभिः परिवारितः॥ धर्मार्थकुशलो राजा धर्मशास्त्रविशारदः। पृच्छामि त्वां कुरुश्रेष्ठ तन्मे व्याख्यातुमर्हसि॥<br />I wish, O grandfather, to hear of that superior intelligence by which king, conversant with the scriptures and well-versed in virtue and profit, may not be stupefied even when surrounded by many enemies. I ask you this, O Kuru chief! You should describe it to a me.</p>
<p id='3'>शत्रुभिर्बहुभिर्गस्तो यथा वर्तेत पार्थिवः। एतदिच्छाम्यहं श्रोतुं सर्वमेव यथाविधि।॥<br />I wish to hear everything in connection with the duties of king when he is attacked by many foes, as has been laid down in the scriptures.</p>
<p id='4'>विषमस्थं हि राजानं शत्रवः परिपन्थिनः। बहवोऽप्येकमुद्धर्तुं यतन्ते पूर्वतापिताः॥<br />When a king meets with distress, a large number of enemies, provoked by his past deeds, rise against him and try to defeat him.</p>
<p id='5'>सर्वत्र प्रार्थ्यमानेन दुर्बलेन महाबलैः। एकेनैवासहायेन शक्यं स्थातुं भवेत् कथम्॥<br />How can king, weak and alone, hold his own, when attacked on all sides by many powerful kings joined in a body?</p>
<p id='6'>कथं मित्रमरिं चापि विन्दते भरतर्षभ। चेष्टितव्यं कथं चात्र शत्रोमित्रस्य चान्तरे॥<br />How does a king at such times make friends and enemies? How should he, O foremost of Bharata's race, treat at such a time, both his friends and enemies?</p>
<p id='7'>प्रज्ञातलक्षणे मित्रे तथैवामित्रतां गते। कथं तु पुरुषः कुर्यात् कृत्वा किं वा सुखी भवेत्॥<br />When those, who are friends really become his enemies, what should the king then do if he is to secure happiness?</p>
<p id='8'>विग्रहं केन वा कुर्यात् संधिं वा केन योजयेत्। कथं वा शत्रुमध्यस्थो वर्तेत बलवानपि॥<br />With whom should he make war and with whom should he make peace? Even if he be strong, how should he act by his foes?</p>
<p id='9'>एतद् वै सर्वकृत्यानां परं कृत्यं परंतप। नैतस्य कश्चिद् वक्तास्ति श्रोता वापि सुदुर्लभः॥ ऋते शान्तनवाद् भीष्मात् सत्यसंधाज्जितेन्द्रियात्। तदन्विष्य महाभाग सर्वमेतद् वदस्व मे।" ।।<br />O scorcher of foes, this I consider to be the most momentous of all questions regarding the satisfaction of royal duties. There are few men, who wish to listen to the answer of this question, and none answer it except Shantanu's truthful son Bhishma, who has ail his senses under control. O you, who are highly blessed, think on it and describe it to me. to</p>
<p id='10'>भीष्म उवाच त्वयुक्तोऽयमनुप्रश्नो युधिष्ठिर सुखोदयः। शृणु मे पुत्र कात्स्र्थेन गुह्यमापत्सु भारत॥<br />'O Yudhishthira, this question certainly becomes you. Its answer yields great happiness. Listen to me, O son, as I describe to you, O Bharata, all the duties which are not generaliy known, but which should be practised in times of distress.</p>
<p id='11'>अमित्रो मित्रतां याति मित्रं चापि प्रदुष्यति। सामर्थ्ययोगात् कार्याणामनित्या वै सदा गतिः॥<br />An enemy becomes a friend, and a friend also becomes an enemy. Through combination of circumstances, human actions become uncertain.</p>
<p id='12'>तस्माद् विश्वसितव्यं च विग्रहं च समाचरेत्। देशं कालं च विज्ञाय कार्याकार्यविनिश्चये॥<br />Regarding what should be done and what should not, it is necessary that in view of the requirements of time and place, one should either trust one's enemies or make war.</p>
<p id='13'>संधातव्यं बुधैर्नित्यं व्यवस्य च हितार्थिभिः। अमित्रैरपि संधेयं प्राणा रक्ष्या हि भारत॥<br />Trying his very best, one should make friends with intelligent and wise men who desire his welfare. one should make peace with even his enemy, when, O Bharata his life cannot be saved by any other means.</p>
<p id='14'>यो ह्यमित्रैर्नरो नित्यं न संदध्यादपण्डितः। न सोऽर्थं प्राप्नुयात् किंचित् फलान्यपि च भारत॥<br />That foolish wight, who never makes peace with enemies, cannot acquire any profit or any of those fruits for which others try.</p>
<p id='15'>यस्त्वमित्रेण संदध्यान्मित्रेण च विरुद्ध्यते। अर्थयुक्तिं समालोक्य सुमहद् विन्दते फलम्॥<br />He, again, who makes peace with enemies and falls out with even friends after carefully considering all circumstances, acquires great fruits.</p>
<p id='16'>अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। मार्जारस्य च संवादं न्यग्रोधे मूषिकस्य च॥<br />Regarding it is cited the old story of the conversation between a cat and mouse at the foot of a banian tree.</p>
<p id='17'>वनो महति कस्मिंश्चिन्यग्रोधः सुमहानभूत्। लताजालपरिच्छिन्नो नानाद्विजगणान्वितः॥<br />Bhishma said There was a huge banian tree in the midst of a vast forest. Covered with many sorts of creepers, and various sorts of birds used to live on it.</p>
<p id='18'>स्कन्धवान् मेघसङ्काशः शीतच्छायो मनोरमः। अरण्यमभितो जातः स तु व्यालमृगाकुलः॥<br />It had a large trunk from which numerous branches spread on all sides. Delightful to look at, its shade was very refreshing. It stood in the midst of the forest, and various animals lived on it.</p>
<p id='19'>तस्य मूलं समाश्रित्य कृत्वा शतमुखं बिलम्। वसति स्म महाप्राज्ञः पलितो नाम मूषिकः॥<br />A highly wise mouse, named Palita, lived at the foot of that tree, having made a hole there with a hundred outlets.</p>
<p id='20'>शाखां तस्य समाश्रित्य वसति स्म सुखं पुरा। लोमशो नाम मार्जारः पक्षिसंघातखादकः॥<br />On the branches of the tree there lived happily a cat, by name Lomasha, daily devouring large number of birds.</p>
<p id='21'>तत्र चागत्य चाण्डालो शरण्ये कृतकेतनः प्रयोजयति चोन्माथं नित्यमस्तंगते रवौ॥<br />Sometime after, a Chandala came to that forest and built a hut for himself. Every evening after sunset he spread his traps.</p>
<p id='22'>तत्र स्नायुमयान् पाशान् यथावत् संविधाय सः। गृहं गत्वा सुखं शेते प्रभातामेति शर्वरीम्॥<br />Spreading his nets made a leathern strings, he returned to his hut, and, passing the night happily in sleep, returned thert at the dawn of day.</p>
<p id='23'>तत्र स्म नित्यं बध्यन्ते नक्तं बहुविधा मृगाः। कदाचिदत्र मार्जारस्त्वप्रमत्तो व्यबध्यत॥<br />Various sorts of animals fell into his traps nightly. And it so took place that one day the cat in a moment of carelessness was caught in the trap.</p>
<p id='24'>तस्मिन् बधे महाप्राणे शत्रौ नित्याततायिनि। तं कालं पलितो ज्ञात्वा प्रचचार सुनिर्भयः॥<br />O you of great wisdom, when his enemy the cat, who is always an enemy of the mice, was thus caught in the trap, the mouse Palita came out of his hole and began to move about fearlessly.</p>
<p id='25'>तेनानुचरता तस्मिन् वने विश्वस्तचारिणा। भक्ष्यं मृगयमाणेन चिराद् दृष्टं तदामिषम्॥<br />While confidently passing through the forest in search of food, the mouse after a little while saw the meat.</p>
<p id='26'>स तमुन्माथमारुह्य तदामिषमभक्षयत्॥ तस्योपरि सपत्नस्य बद्धस्य मनसा हसन्।<br />Getting upon the trap, the little animal began to eat the flesh. Laughing in his mind, he even got upon his enemy caught in the net.</p>
<p id='27'>आमिषे तु प्रसक्तः स कदाचिदवलोकयन्॥ अपश्यदपरं घोरमात्मनः शत्रुमागतम्।<br />Busy with eating the flesh, did not see his own danger, and as he suddenly cast his eyes, he saw there a dreadful enemy of his.</p>
<p id='28'>शरप्रसूनसङ्काशं महीविवरशायिनम्॥ नकुलं हरिणं नाम चपलं ताम्रलोचनम्।<br />It was a restless mongoose of coppery eyes, of the name of Harita. Living in holes underneath, its body resembled the flower of a reed.</p>
<p id='29'>तेन मूषिकगन्धेन त्वरमाणमुपागतम्॥ भक्ष्यार्थं संलिहानं तं भूमावूर्ध्वमुखं स्थितम्। शाखागतमरिं चान्यमपश्यत् कोटरालयम्॥ उलूकं चन्द्रकं नाम तीक्ष्णतुण्डं क्षपाचरम्। गतस्य विषयं तत्र नकुलोलूकयोस्तथा॥ अथास्यासीदियं चिन्ता तत् प्राप्य सुमहद्भयम्।<br />Tempted to come there by the scent of the mouse, the animal came quickly for devouring his pray. He stood on his haunches, with head raised up and licking the corners of his mouth with his tongue. The mouse saw at the same time another enemy living in the holes of trees, then sitting on the branch of the banian. It was night-ranging owl, by name Chandraka having sharp beaks. Being seen both by the mongoose and the owl, the mouse, in great fear, began to think thus.</p>
<p id='30'>आपद्यस्यां सुकशयां मरणे प्रत्युपस्थिते॥ समन्ताद् भय उत्पन्ने कथं कार्यं हितैषिणा।<br />In such a great danger, when death itself is staring me in the face, when fear prevails on every side, how should one act who seeks his own well being?</p>
<p id='31'>स तथा सर्वतो रुद्धः सर्वत्र भयदर्शनः॥ अभवद् भयसंतप्तश्चक्रे च परमां मतिम्।<br />Beset with danger, and seeing fear on all sides, the mouse, stricken with fear for his safety, made a high resolution.</p>
<p id='32'>आपद्विनाशभूयिष्ठं गतैः कार्यं हि जीवितम्॥ समन्तात् संशयात् सैषा तस्मादापदुपस्थिता।<br />Preventing numberless dangers by hundreds of means, one should always save his life. Danger, now, besets me on every side.</p>
<p id='33'>गतं मा सहसा भूमिं नकुलो भक्षयिष्यति॥ उलूकश्छेह तिष्ठन्तं मार्जार: पाशसंक्षयात्।<br />If I were to descend from this trap on the ground, without sufficient precautions, the mongoose will surely catch and devour me. If I remain on this trap, the owl will surely catch me. If, again, the cat can free himself for the net, he, also, is certain to devour me.</p>
<p id='34'>न त्वेवास्मद्विधः प्राज्ञः सम्मोहं गन्तुमर्हति॥ करिष्ये जीविते यत्नं यावद् युक्त्या प्रतिग्रहात्।<br />It is not proper, therefore, that a person intelligent like myself should lose his wits. I shall, therefore, try me best to save my life, by having recourse to proper means and intelligence.</p>
<p id='35'>न हि बुद्ध्यान्वितः प्राज्ञो नीतिशास्त्रविशारदः॥ निमज्जत्यापदं प्राप्य महतीं दारुणामपि॥<br />An intelligent and wise person and conversant with the science of policy never sinks, however great and terrible may be the danger which threatens him.</p>
<p id='36'>न त्वन्यामिह मार्जाराद् गतिं पश्यामि साम्प्रतम्। विषमस्थो ह्ययं शत्रुः कृत्यं चास्य महन्मया॥<br />At present, however, I do not see any other refuge than this cat. He is an enemy. But he is in difficulty. The service that I can do him is verygreat.</p>
<p id='37'>जीवितार्थी कथं त्वद्य शत्रुभिः प्रार्थितस्त्रिभिः। तस्मादेनमहं शत्रु मार्जारं संश्रयामि वै॥<br />Three enemies are trying to devour me, and how should I now act for saving my life? I should now seek refuge with one of those enemies, viz., the cat.</p>
<p id='38'>नीतिशास्त्रं समाश्रित्य हितमस्योपवर्णये। येनेमं शत्रुसंघातं मतिपूर्वेण वञ्चये॥<br />Following policy, let me advice the cat for his behoof, so that I may, with my intelligence, escape from all three.</p>
<p id='39'>अयमत्यन्तशत्रुर्मे वैषम्यं परमं गतः। मूढो ग्राहयितुं स्वार्थं सङ्गत्या यदि शक्यते॥ कदाचिद् व्यसनं प्राप्य संधि कुर्यान्मया सह!<br />The cat is my great enemy, but the danger into which he has fallen is very great. Let me see if I can make this foolish creature understand his own interests. Having fallen into such difficulty he may make peace with me.</p>
<p id='40'>बलिना संनिकृष्टस्य शत्रोरपि परिग्रहः॥ कार्य इत्याहुराचार्या विषमे जीवितार्थिना।<br />A person, when attacked by a stronger one, should make peace with even an enemy. People conversant with policy say that such should be the conduct of one, who being beset with danger seeks to save his life.</p>
<p id='41'>श्रेष्ठो हि पण्डितः शत्रुर्न च मित्रमपण्डितः॥ मम त्वमित्रे माजरि जीवितं सम्प्रतिष्ठितम्।<br />It is better to have a learned person for an enemy than a fool for a friend. As for myself, my life now depends entirely on the hands of my enemy the cat.</p>
<p id='42'>हन्तास्मै सम्प्रवक्ष्यामि हेतुमात्माभिरक्षणे॥ अपीदानीमयं शत्रुः सङ्गत्या पण्डितो भवेत्।<br />I shall now speak to the cat about his own liberation. Perhaps, now it would not be wrong to consider the cat an intelligent and learned enemy. Thus did that mouse, surrounded by foes, think.</p>
<p id='43'>एवं विचिन्तयामास मूषिकः शत्रुचेष्टितम्॥ ततोऽर्थगतितत्त्वज्ञः संधिविग्रहकालवित्। सान्त्वपूर्वमिदं वाक्यं मार्जारं मूषिकोऽब्रवीत्॥<br />Having thought thus, the mouse, well-read in the science of Profit and well-acquainted with times when war should be declared and peace made, gently spoke to the cat, saying,</p>
<p id='44'>सौहृदेनाभिभाषे त्वां कच्चिन्मार्जार जीवसि। जीवितं हि तवेच्छामि श्रेयः साधारणं हि नौ॥<br />I speak to you as a friend. O cat! Are you alive? I wish you to live! I seek the good of us both.</p>

<p id='46'>अस्मि कश्चिदुपायोऽत्र दुष्करः प्रतिभाति मे। येन शक्यस्त्वया मोक्षः प्राप्तुं श्रेयस्तथा मया॥<br />There is a very good means I see by which you may obtain escape and I may acquire great benefit.</p>
<p id='47'>मयाप्युपायो दृष्टोऽयं विचार्य मतिमात्मनः। आत्मार्थं च त्वदर्थं च श्रेय: साधारणं हि नौ॥<br />By thinking I have found out this expedient for your sake and for my sake, for it will do us both good.</p>
<p id='48'>इदं हि नकुलोलूकं पापबुद्ध्याभिसंस्थितम्। न धर्षयति मार्जार तेन मे स्वस्ति साम्प्रतम्॥<br />There are the mongoose and the owl, both waiting with evil desire. O cat, so long as they do not attack me, my life is safe.</p>
<p id='49'>कूजंश्चपलनेत्रोऽयं कौशिको मां निरीक्षते। नगशाखाग्रगः पापस्तस्याहं भृशमुद्विजे॥<br />There that wretched owl with restless looks and dreadful cries is seeing me from the branch of that tree! I am stricken with great fear.</p>
<p id='50'>सतां साप्तपदं मैत्रं स सखा मेऽसि पण्डितः। सांवास्यकं करिष्यामि नास्ति ते भयमद्य वै॥<br />Good men become friends by walking together only seven steps. Highly wise as you are, you are my friend. I shall treat you as a friend. You need have no fear now.</p>
<p id='51'>न हि शक्तोऽसि मार्जार पाशं छेत्तुं मया विना। अहं छेत्स्यामि पाशांस्ते यदि मां त्वं न हिंससि॥<br />Without my help, O cat, you will not be able to tear the net. I, however, shall cut the net for serving you, if you do not kill me.</p>
<p id='52'>त्वमाश्रितो दुमस्याग्रं मूलं त्वहमुपाश्रितः। चिरोषितावुभावावां वृक्षेऽस्मिन् विदितं च ते॥<br />You have lived on this tree and I have lived at its foot. Both of us have lived here for many long years, All this is known to you.</p>
<p id='53'>यस्मिन्नाश्वासते कश्चिद् यश्च नाश्वसिति क्वचित्। न तो धीराः प्रशंसन्ति नित्यमुद्विग्नमानसौ॥<br />The wise never laud him whom nobody trusts, nor him who never trusts another. Both of them are unhappy.</p>
<p id='54'>तस्माद् विवर्धतां प्रीतिर्नित्यं संगतमस्तु कालातीतमिहार्थं तु न प्रशंसन्ति पण्डिताः॥<br />Therefore, let our love for each other increase, and let us be united. The wise never speak highly of the attempt of doing an act when its opportunity is gone.</p>
<p id='55'>अर्थयुक्तिमिमां तत्र यथाभूतां निशामय। तव जीवितमिच्छामि त्वं ममेच्छसि जीवितम्॥ नौ।<br />Know this to be the proper time for such a compact between us. I wish that you should live, and you also wish that I should live.</p>

<p id='80'>तथैव तौ सुसंत्रस्तौ दृढमागततन्द्रितौ। दृष्ट्वा तयोः परां प्रीति विस्मयं परमं गतौ॥<br />Marking that close intimacy between the mouse and the cat, both Harita and Chandraka became stricken with fear and wonder.</p>
<p id='81'>बलिनौ मतिमन्तौ च सुवृत्तौ चाप्युपासितौ। अशक्तौ तु नयात् तस्मात् सम्प्रधर्षयितुं बलात्॥<br />Both of them were endued with strength and intelligence. Clever in catching their prey, though near, the mongoose and the owl could not make the mouse and the cat break that agreement.</p>
<p id='82'>कार्यार्थं कृतसंधी तौ दृष्ट्वा मार्जारमूषिको। उलूकनकुलौ तूर्णं जग्मतुस्तौ स्वमालयम्॥<br />Indeed, seeing the cat and the mouse make that agreement for fulfilling their mutual object, the mongoose and the owl both left that spot and repaired to their respective quarters.</p>

Do you disregard me now, having accomplished your own work? O slayer of foes, cut off these strings quickly! The hunter will soon come hereइत्युक्तस्त्वरता तेन मतिमान् पलितोऽब्रवीत्।</p>
<p id='86'>मार्जारमकृतप्रज्ञं पथ्यमात्महितं वचः॥<br />Thus addressed by the impatient cat, the intelligent mouse said these beneficial words to the cat who did not seem to possess much wisdom-</p>

<p id='94'>अथात्मकृत्ये त्वरितः सम्यक् प्रश्रितमाचरन्। उवाच लोमशो वाक्यं मूषिकं चिरकारिणम्॥<br />Indeed, the cat, who had quickly and properly carried his own part of the agreement, addressing the mouse who was not quick enough in fulfilling his part, said,-</p>
<p id='95'>न ह्येवं मित्रकार्याणि प्रीत्या कुर्वन्ति साधवः। यथा त्वं मोक्षितः कृच्छ्रात् त्वरमाणेन वै मया॥<br />I saved you from a great danger with considerable promptness. Alas, honest persons never thus do the business of their friends. Filled with joy while doing it, they do it otherwise.</p>

<p id='99'>तमेवंवादिनः प्राज्ञः शास्त्रबुद्धिसमन्वितः। उवाचेदं वचः श्रेष्ठं मार्जार मूषिकस्तदा॥<br />After the cat had said these words, the intelligent and wise mouse, well-read in the</p>
<p id='100'>श्रुतं मे तव मार्जार स्वमर्थं परिगृह्णतः। ममापि त्वं विजानासि स्वमर्थं परिगृह्णतः॥<br />I have, O cat, heard what you have said to further your own object. Listen, however, to me as I tell you what is proper for my own objects.</p>
<p id='101'>यन्मित्रं भीतवत्साध्यं यन्मित्रं भयसंहितम्। सुरक्षितव्यं तत् कार्यं पाणिः सर्पमुखादिव॥<br />That friendship which is beset with fear and which cannot be maintained without fear, should be preserved with great caution like the hand (of the snake-charmer) from the snake's fangs!</p>
<p id='102'>कृत्वा बलवता संधिमात्मनं यो न रक्षति। अपथ्यमिव तद् भुक्तं तस्य नार्थाय कल्पते॥<br />The person that does not protect himself after having made an agreement with a stronger individual, sees that is yields instead of good.</p>

His appearance was terrible. His hair was black and tawny. His hips were huge and his look was very fierce. Of a large mouth extending from ear to ear, and highly filthy, his ears were very long. man Armed with weapons and accompanied by a pack of dogs, the grim-visaged man came there.</p>
<p id='108'>तं दृष्ट्वा यमदूताभं मार्जारस्त्रस्तचेतनः॥ उवाच वचनं भीतः किमिदानीं करिष्यसि।<br />Seeing that who resembled a messenger of Yama, the cat was stricken with fear. Filled with fear, he addressed Palita, saying,-What will you do now?</p>
<p id='109'>अथ तावपि संत्रस्तौ तं दृष्ट्वा घोरसंकुलम्॥ क्षणेन नकुलोलूको नैराश्यमुपजग्मतुः। बलिनौ मतिमन्तौ च संघाते चाप्युपागतौ॥ अशक्तौ सुनयात् तस्मात् सम्प्रधर्षयितुं बलात्। कार्यार्थे कृतसंधानौ दृष्ट्वा मार्जारमूषिकौ॥ उलूकनकुलौ तत्र जग्मतुः स्वं स्वमालयम्।<br />The two were afraid seeing dreadful Chandala, mongoose and owl came in to hopeless. Indeed they were very strong and intelligent but could not over-press on strength less but with good conduct cat and mouse. Therefore, they both owl and mangoose left for their own place.</p>
<p id='110'>ततश्चिच्छेद तं पाशं मार्जारस्य च मूषिकः॥ विप्रमुक्तोऽथ मार्जारस्तमेवाभ्यपतद् दुमम्। स तस्मात् सम्भ्रमावर्तान्मुक्तो घोरेण शत्रुणा॥ बिलं विवेश पलितः शाखां लेभे स लोमशः।<br />The mouse very quickly cut the remaining string which held fast that cat. Freed from the noose, the cat run quickly and got upon the banian. Palita also, freed from that perilous position and from the presence of a terrible enemy quickly fled and entered his hole. Lomasha meanwhile had got upon the high tree.</p>
<p id='111'>उन्माथमप्यथादाय चाण्डालो वीक्ष्य सर्वशः॥ विहताशः क्षणेनास्ते तस्माद् देशादपाक्रमत्।<br />Seeing everything, the hunter took up his net. His hopes defeated, he also quickly left that place.</p>

I hope you do not suspect me of any evil motive. I am certainly grateful and you have done me a great service.</p>

<p id='123'>वेदितव्यानि मित्राणि विज्ञेयाश्चापि शत्रवः। एतत् सुसूक्ष्मं लोकेऽस्मिन् दृश्यते प्राज्ञसम्मतम्॥<br />Friends should be well tried. Enemies also should be well studied. In this world, a task like this is considered by even the learned as a difficult one requiring sharp intelligence.</p>
<p id='124'>शत्रुरूपा हि सुहृदो मित्ररूपाश्च शत्रवः। संधितास्ते न बुद्ध्यन्ते कामक्रोधवशं गताः॥<br />Friends appear like enemies, and enemies appear like friends. When agreements of friendship are made, it is difficult for the parties to know whether they are really actuated by lust and anger.</p>
<p id='125'>नास्ति जातु रिपुर्नाम मित्रं नाम न विद्यते। सामर्थ्ययोगाज्जायन्ते मित्राणि रिपवस्तथा॥<br />There is no such thing as a friend. It is circumstances which make friends and enemies.</p>

<p id='128'>मित्रं च शत्रुतामेति कस्मिंश्चित् कालपर्यये। शत्रुश्च मित्रतामेति स्वार्थो हि बलवत्तरः॥<br />Friendship becomes enmity in the course of time. An enemy also becomes a friend. Selfinterest is very powerful.</p>
<p id='129'>यो विश्वसिति मित्रेषु न विश्वसिति शत्रुषु। अर्थयुक्तिमविज्ञाय यः प्रीतौ कुरुते मनः॥ मित्रे वा यदि वा शत्रौ तस्यापि चलिता मतिः।<br />He, who blindly places confidence in friends and always treats enemies mistrustfully without paying any heed to considerations of policy, finds his life unsafe. He, who, neglecting all considerations of policy, seeks either friends or foes, is regarded as a person whose understanding has been unhinged.</p>
<p id='130'>न विश्वसेदविश्वस्ते विश्वस्ते नातिविश्वसेत्॥ विश्वासाद् भयमुत्पन्नमपि मूलानि कृन्तति।<br />One should not trust a person undeserving of truth, nor should one trust too much a person worthy of trust. The anger from blind confidence is such that it cuts the very roots.</p>
<p id='131'>अर्थयुक्त्या हि जायन्ते पिता माता सुतस्तथा॥ मातुला भागिनेयाश्च तथा सम्बन्धिबान्धवाः।<br />The father, the mother, the son, the maternal uncle, the sister's son, and other relatives and kinsmen, are all moved by interest and profit.</p>
<p id='132'>पुत्रं हि मातापितरौ त्यजतः पतितं प्रियम्॥ लोको रक्षति चात्मानं पश्य स्वार्थस्य सारताम्।<br />Father and mother may be seen to discard the dear son if he is addicted to irregular practices. People take care of their own selves. See the efficacy of self-interest.</p>
<p id='133'>सामान्या निष्कृतिः प्राज्ञ यो मोक्षात् प्रत्यनन्तरम्॥१४७। कृतं मृगयसे शत्रु सुखोपायमसंशयम्।<br />O highly wise one, his escape is very difficult, who, immediately after he is freed from danger, seeks the means of his enemy's happiness.</p>
<p id='134'>अस्मिन् निलय एव त्वं न्यग्रोधादवतारितः॥ पूर्वं निविष्टमुन्मार्थ चपलत्वान्न बुद्धवान्।<br />You have come down from the top of the tree to this very spot. You could not, from foolishness know that a net had been spread here.</p>
<p id='135'>आत्मनश्चपलो नास्ति कुतोऽन्येषां भविष्यति॥ तस्मात् सर्वाणि कार्याणि चपलो हन्त्यसंशयम्।<br />A person, who has no sense, cannot protect his own self. How can be protect others? Such a person, forsooth, ruins all his acts.</p>
<p id='136'>ब्रवीषि मधुरं यच्च प्रियो मेऽद्य भवानिति॥ तन्मित्र कारणं सर्वं विस्तरेणापि मे शृणु।<br />You speak sweetly that I am very dear to you. Hear me, however, O friends, the reasons which I have on my side.</p>
<p id='137'>कारणात् प्रियतामेति द्वेष्यो भवति कारणात्॥ अर्थार्थी जीवलोकोऽयं न कश्चित् कस्यचित् प्रियः।<br />One becomes dear from a sufficient cause. One becomes an enemy from sufficient cause. The entire world of creatures is actuated by the desire of gain. One never becomes dear to another without cause.</p>
<p id='138'>सख्यं सोदर्ययोर्धात्रोर्दम्पत्योर्वा परस्परम्॥ कस्यचिन्नाभिजानामि प्रीति निष्कारणामिह। यद्यपि भ्रातरः क्रुद्धा भार्या वा कारणान्तरे॥ स्वभावतस्ते प्रीयन्ते नेतरः प्रीयते जनः।<br />The friendship between two uterine brothers, the love between husband and wife, rests upon interest. I do not know any kind of love amongst persons that does not depend upon some motive of self-interest. It is sometimes seen that uterine brothers or husband and wife having quarrelled are united again from a natural affection. But such a thing is not to be seen in persons who are not connected with one another.</p>
<p id='139'>प्रियो भवति दानेन प्रियवादेन चापरः॥ मन्त्रहोमजपैरन्यः कार्यार्थं प्रीयते जनः।<br />One becomes dear for his liberality. Another becomes dear for his sweet words. A third becomes so for his religious acts. Generally, a person becomes dear for the purpose he serves.</p>
<p id='140'>उत्पन्ना कारणे प्रीतिरासीनौ कारणान्तरे॥ प्रध्वस्ते कारणस्थाने सा प्रीतिर्विनिवर्तते।<br />The love between us originated from an adequate cause, That cause no longer exists. On the other hand, from sufficient reasons that friendship between us has terminated,</p>
<p id='141'>किं नु तत् कारणं मन्ये येनाहं भवतः प्रियः॥ अन्यत्राभ्यवहारार्थं तत्रापि च बुधा वयम्।<br />What is that reason, I ask, for which I have become so dear to you, besides your desire for eating me up? You should know that I am not forgetful of this.</p>
<p id='142'>कालो हेतुं विकुरुते स्वार्थस्तमनुवर्तते॥ स्वार्थं प्राज्ञोऽभिजानाति प्राज्ञं लोकोऽनुवर्तते। न त्वीदृशं त्वया वाच्यं विदुषि स्वार्थपण्डिते॥<br />Time spoils reasons. You seek your own interests. Otherwise men, again, understand their own interests. The world is guided by the example of the wise. You should not thus speak to a person who is learned and capable of understanding his own interests.</p>
<p id='143'>अकाले हि समर्थस्य स्नेहहेतुरयं तव। तस्मान्नाहं चले स्वार्थात् सुस्थिरः संधिविग्रहे॥ अभ्राणामिव रूपाणि विकुर्वन्ति क्षणे क्षणे। अद्यैव हि रिपुर्भूत्वा पुनरद्यैव मे सुहृत्॥ पुनश्च रिपुरद्यैव युक्तीनां पश्य चापलम्।<br />You are powerful. The reason which you show for your love for me now is ill-timed. Moved, however, by my own interests, I am always very strong about peace and war that are themselves very unstable. The circumstances under which peace is to be made or war declared change as speedily as the clouds change their form. This very day you were my enemy. This every day again, you becaiae my friend. This very day you have again become my enemy. Mark the considerations that move living creatures!</p>

<p id='146'>सोऽहमेवं प्रणीतानि ज्ञात्वा शास्त्राणि तत्त्वतः॥ प्रविशेयं कथं पाशं त्वत्कृते तद् वदस्व मे।<br />I am well-read in the dictates of policy; tell me, why shall I enter to-day, for your sake, the net that is spread for me?</p>
<p id='147'>त्ववीर्येण प्रमुक्ताऽहं मदूवीर्येण तथा भवान्॥ अन्योन्यानुग्रहे वृत्ते नास्ति भूयः समागमः।<br />Through your power I was freed from a great danger.

<p id='151'>भक्ष्यार्थं ह्यवबद्धस्त्वं स मुक्तः पीडितः क्षुधा॥ शास्त्रजां मतिमास्थाय नूनं भक्षयिताध माम्।<br />You were entangled in the net for the sake of food. You have been freed from it. You feel now the pangs of hunger. Following wisdom of the scriptures, you try to eat me up to-day.</p>
<p id='152'>जानामि क्षुधितं दु त्वामाहारसमयश्च ते॥ स त्वं मानभिसंधाय भक्ष्यं मृगयसे पुनः।<br />I know that you are hungry. I know that this is the time of you taking food. You are seeking your prey, and you have your eyes on me.</p>

<p id='155'>नाहं त्वया समेष्यापि वृत्तो हेतुः समागमे॥ शिवं ध्यायस्व मे स्वस्थः सुकृतं स्मरसे यदि।<br />I shall not, therefore, make friendship with you. There is no reason any longer for such a union. If, indeed, you do not forget my good offices, think of what will be good for me and be comfortable.</p>
<p id='156'>शत्रोरनार्यभूतस्य क्लिष्टस्य क्षुधितस्य च॥ भक्ष्यं मृगयमाणस्य कः प्राज्ञो विषयं व्रजेत्।<br />What sane man will place himself under the power of an enemy who is not well-known for virtue, who is hungry, and who is in search of a prey?</p>
<p id='157'>स्वस्ति तेऽस्तु गमिष्यामि दूरादपि तवोद्विजे॥ विश्वस्तं वा प्रमत्तं वा एतदेव कृतं भवेत्।<br />If you think that I have done you a service, do me a friend's work when I may happen to move trustfully or carelessly. Even that will be gratitude in you.</p>
<p id='158'>बलवत्संनिकर्षो हि न कदाचित् प्रशस्यते॥ नाहं त्वया समेष्यामि निवृत्तो भव लोमश।<br />Be happy then, I will presently leave you. I am afraid even to see you from a distance. I shall not mix with you, give up your attempts, OLomasha!</p>
