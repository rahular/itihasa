<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 1OO</h3><h4>How should kings lead their armies in the battle-field</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच यथा जयार्थिनः सेनां नयन्ति भरतर्षभ। ईषद्धर्मं प्रपीड्यापि तन्मे ब्रूहि पितामह॥<br />Yudhishthira said Tell me, O grandfather, how kings seeking victory should, O foremost of Bharata's race, lead their troops to battle even by acting slightly against the rules of righteousness.</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच सतयेन हि स्थितो धर्म उपपत्त्या तथा परे। साध्वाचारतया केचित् तथैवौपयिकादपि॥<br />Bhishma said Some say that Righteousness is made permanent by Truth; some, by Reasoning; some, by good conduct; and some, by the application of means and contrivances.</p>
<p id='3'>उपायधर्मान् वक्ष्यामि सिद्धार्थानर्थधर्मयोः। निर्मर्यादा दस्यवस्तु भवन्ति परिपन्थिनः॥<br />I shall presently describe to you the means and contrivances, which yield immediate fruit. Robbers, transgressing all wholesome limits, very often become destroyers of property and religious merit.</p>
<p id='4'>तेषां प्रतिविघातार्थं प्रवक्ष्याम्यथ नैगमम्। कार्याणां सर्वसिद्ध्यर्थं तानुपायान् निबोध मे॥<br />For opposing and restraining them, I shall tell you the means indicated in the scriptures. Hear as I describe those means for the success of all deeds.</p>
<p id='5'>उभे प्रज्ञे वेदितव्ये ऋज्वी वक्रा च भारत। जानन् वक्रां न सेवेत प्रतिबाधेत चागताम्॥<br />Both kinds of wisdom, plain and wily, should be within the king's reach. Though acquainted with it, he should not, however, apply the wily wisdom. He may use it for withstanding the dangers that may befall him.</p>
<p id='6'>अमित्रा एव राजानं भेदेनोपचरन्त्युत। तां राजा निकृति जानन् यथामित्रान् प्रबाधते॥<br />Enemies frequently injure a king by creating disunion. The king, conversant with deceit, may, by the help of deceit, counteract those enemies.</p>
<p id='7'>गजानां पार्थ वर्माणि गोवृषाजगराणि च। शल्यकण्टकलोहानि तनुत्रचमराणि च॥ सितपीतानि शस्त्राणि संनाहाः पीतलोहिताः। नानारञ्जनरक्ताः स्युः पताका: केतवश्च ह॥ ऋश्यस्तोमराः खड्गा निशिताश्च परश्वधाः। फलकान्यथ चर्माणि प्रतिकल्प्यान्यनेकशः॥<br />Leathern armour for protecting the bodies of elephants, as also those for bulls, bones, thorns, and keen-pointed iron weapons, coats of mail, yak-tails, sharp and well-tempered weapons, all kinds of armour yellow and red, banners and standards of various colours, swords, lances, sharp scimitars, battle axes, spears and shields should be manufactured and kept profusely in store.</p>
<p id='8'>अभिनीतानि शस्त्राणि योधाश्च कृतनिश्चयाः। चैत्र्यां वा मार्गशीर्थ्यां वा सेनायोगः प्रशस्यते॥<br />The weapons should all be properly whetted. The soldiers should be filled with courage and resolution. It is proper to march the troops in the month of Chaitra Agrahayana.</p>
<p id='9'>पक्वसस्या हि पृथिवी भवत्यम्बुमती तदा। नैवातिशीतो नात्युष्ण: कालो भवति भारत॥<br />The crops ripen about that time and water also is not scarce. That time of the year, O Bharata, is neither very cold nor very hot.</p>
<p id='10'>तस्मात् तदा योजयेत परेषां व्यसनेऽथवा। एते हि योगाः सेनायाः प्रशस्ताः परवाधने॥<br />Troops should, therefore, be marched at that time. If the enemy, however, be reduced to a miserable plight, troops should immediately be despatched. These (two) are the best occasions for the movement of troops for defeating the enemies.</p>
<p id='11'>जलवांस्तृणवान् मार्गः समो गम्यः प्रशस्यते। चारैः सुविदिताभ्यासः कुशलैर्वनगोचरैः॥<br />That road which has profuse water and grass along it, which is level and easy of march, should be taken. The regions lying near the road should previously be reconnoitred through skilful spies having an intimate knowledge of the woods.</p>
<p id='12'>न हरण्येन शक्येत गन्तुं मृगगणैरिव। तस्मात् सेनासु तानेव योजयन्ति जयार्थिनः॥<br />The troops must not, like animals, be marched through forests. Kings desirous of victory should, therefore, follow good roads for marching their army.</p>
<p id='13'>अग्रतः पुरुषानीकं शक्तं चापि कुलोद्भवम्। आवासस्तोयवान् दुर्ग: पर्याकाशः प्रशस्यते॥<br />In the van should be placed a detachment of brave, strong and high born men. As regards forts, one which has walls and a trench full of water on every side and only one entrance, is the best.</p>
<p id='14'>परेषामुपसर्पाणां प्रतिषेधस्तथा भवेत्। आकाशात् तु वनाभ्याशं मन्यन्ते गुणवत्तरम्॥ बहुभिर्गुणजातैश्च ये युद्धकुशला जनाः। उपन्यासो भवेत् तत्र बलानां नातिदूरतः॥<br />While attacking enemies resistance may be offered from within it. In pitching the camp, a region lying near the forest is regarded as much better than one under the open sky by men who are masters of military science and warfare. The camp should be pitched for the troops not far from such a forest.</p>
<p id='15'>उपन्यासावतरणं पदातीनां च गृहनम्। अथ शत्रुप्रतीघातमापदर्थं परायणम्॥<br />Pitching the camp at such a place, placing the infantry in a safe place, and meeting the foe as soon as he comes, are the means for preventing danger and distress.</p>
<p id='16'>सप्तर्षीन् पृष्ठतः कृत्वा युध्येयुरचला इव। अनेन विधिना शत्रून् जिगीषेतापि दुर्जयान्॥<br />Keeping the constellation called Ursa Major behind them, the troops should fight, standing firmly like hills. By this means, one may defeat even irresistible foes.</p>
<p id='17'>यतो वायुर्यतः सूर्यो यतः शुक्रस्ततो जयः। पूर्वं पूर्वं ज्याय एषां संनिपाते युधिष्ठिर॥<br />The soldiers should be placed in such a position that the wind, the sun, and the planet Shukra should blow and shine from behind them. For acquiring victory, the wind is superior to the Sun, and the sun is superior to Shukra, O Yudhishthira.</p>
<p id='18'>अकर्दमामनुदकाममर्यादामलोष्टकाम्। अश्वभूमि प्रशंसन्ति ये युद्धकुशला जनाः॥<br />Men who know the art of warfare approve of a region which is freed from mire, and which is to watery, not uneven, and not abounding with bricks and stone, as well fitted for the operations of cavalry.</p>
<p id='19'>अपङ्का गर्तरहिता रथभूमिः प्रशस्यते। नीचगुमा महाकक्षा सोदका हस्तियोधिनाम्॥<br />A field which is free from mire and holes is best suited for car-warriors. A region which abounds with bushes and large trees and which is under water is suited for elephant warriors.</p>
<p id='20'>बहुदुर्गा महाकक्षा वेणुवेत्रसमाकुला। पदातीनां क्षमा भूमिः पर्वतोपवनानि च॥<br />A region which has many inaccessible spots, which abounds with huge trees and cane bushes, as also a hilly or woody region, is well suiles for the work of infantry.</p>
<p id='21'>पदातिबहुला सेना दृढा भवति भारत। रथाश्वबहुला सेना सुदिनेषु प्रशस्यते॥<br />An army, O Bharata, which has a large infantry, is considered very strong. An army which has a greater number of cars and horsemen is considered to be very powerful in a clear day.</p>
<p id='22'>पदातिनागबहुला प्रावृट्काले प्रशस्यते। गुणानेतान् प्रसंख्याय देशकालौ प्रयोजयेत्॥<br />An army, again, which consists of a greater number of infantry and elephants becomes effective in the rains. Having carefully observed these points, the king should devote his attention to the characteristics of place and time.</p>
<p id='23'>एवं संचिन्त्य यो याति तिथिनक्षत्रपूजितः। विजयं लभते नित्यं सेना सम्यक् प्रयोजयन्।<br />That king, who, having attended to all these points, marches, under a proper constellation and an auspicious luminary, always succeeds in acquiring victory by properly leading his troops.</p>
<p id='24'>प्रसुप्तांस्तृषिताश्रान्तान् प्रकीर्णान् नाभिघातयेत्॥ मोक्षे प्रयाणे चलने पानभोजनकालयोः। अतिक्षिप्तान् व्यतिक्षिप्तान् निहतान् प्रतनूकृतान्॥ सुविश्रब्धान् कृतारम्भानुपन्यासान् प्रतापितान्। बहिश्चरानुपन्यासान् कृतवेश्मानुसारिणः॥ पारम्पर्यागते द्वारे ये केचिदनुवर्तिनः। परिचर्यावतो द्वारे ये च केचन वर्गिणः॥<br />No one should kill the sleepy, or the thirsty, or the fatigued, or one whose armours have fallen away, or one who has set his heart on final liberation, or one who is flying away, or one who is walking along a road, or one engaged in drinking or eating, or one who is mad, or one who is insane, or one who has been wounded morally, or one who has been greatly weakened by his wounds, or one who is residing confidentally, or one who has begun any task without having been able to finish it, or one who is a master of some particular art, or one who is in grief, or one who goes out of the camp for procuring forage or fodder, or men who pitch camps or are camp-followers, or those who wait at the gates of the king or of his ministers, or his menials, or the head of such servants.</p>
<p id='25'>अनीकं ये विभिन्दन्ति भिन्न संस्थापयन्ति च। समानाशनपानास्ते कार्याः द्विगुणवेतनाः॥<br />Those of your warriors who break the ranks of enemies, or rally your retreating soldiers, should have their pay doubled and should be honoured by you with food, drink, and seats equal to your own.</p>
<p id='26'>दशाधिपतयः कार्याः शताधिपतयस्तथा। ततः सहस्राधिपतिं कुर्याच्छूरमतन्द्रितम्॥<br />The heads of ten soldiers amongst them should be made heads of a hundred. And the careful hero who is the head of a hundred soldiers, should be made the head of a thousand.</p>
<p id='27'>यथामुख्यान् संनिपात्य वक्तव्याः संशपामहे। विजयार्थं हि संग्रामे न त्यक्ष्यामः परस्परम्॥<br />Gathering together the leading warriors, they should be addressed, saying,-Let us swear to conquer, and never to leave one another!</p>
<p id='28'>इहैव ते निवर्तन्तां ये च केचन भीरवः। ये घातयेयुः प्रवरं कुर्वाणास्तुमुलं प्रति॥<br />Let those, who are afraid of their life, remain where they are. Let those also stay behind who would cause their chiefs to be killed by themselves neglecting to act heroically in the thick of the fray!</p>
<p id='29'>न संनिपाते प्रदरं वधं वा कुर्युरीदृशाः। आत्मानं च स्वपक्षं च पालयन् हन्ति संयुगे॥<br />Let such men only come as would never retreat from battle or cause their own comrades to be killed! Protecting their own selves as also their comrades, they are sure to kill the enemy in fight.</p>
<p id='30'>अर्थनाशो वधोऽकीर्तिरयशच पलायने। अमनोज्ञासुखा वाचः पुरुषस्य पलायने॥ प्रतिध्वस्तोष्ठदन्तस्य न्यस्तसर्वायुधस्य च। अमित्रैरवरुद्धस्य द्विषतामस्तु नः सदा॥<br />The result of retreating from battle is loss of wealth, death, infamy, and reproach. Unpleasant, sharp and cutting remarks await the fate of him who retreats from battle, who lose his lips and teeth, who casts off all his weapons, or who allows himself to be taken as a captive by the enemy. Let such evil results always befall the warriors of our enemies.</p>
<p id='31'>मनुष्यापसदा ह्येते ये भवन्ति पराङ्मुखा। राशिवर्धनमात्रास्ते नैव ते प्रेत्य नो इह॥<br />Those who retreat from battle are wretches among men. They simply increase the number of men. They will neither pass in this world nor in the next for true manhood.</p>
<p id='32'>अमित्रा हृष्टमनसः प्रत्युद्यान्ति पलायिनम्। जयिनस्तु नरास्तात चन्दनैर्मण्डनेन च॥<br />Victorious enemies, O Sire, proceed gladly in pursuit of the flying combatants, their praises all the while recited by bards.</p>
<p id='33'>यस्य स्म संग्रामगता यशो वै मन्ति शत्रवः। तदसह्यतरं दुःखमहं मन्ये वधादपि॥<br />When enemies, coming to battle spoil the fame of a person, the misery the latter feels is more piercing, I think, than that of death itself.</p>
<p id='34'>जयं जानीत धर्मस्य मूलं सर्वसुखस्य च। या भीरूणां परा ग्लानिः शूरस्तामधिगच्छति॥<br />Know that victory is the source of religious merit and of every sort of happiness. The heroes bear cheerfully what is regarded as the highest misery by cowards.</p>
<p id='35'>ते वयं स्वर्गमिच्छन्तः संग्रामे त्यक्तजीविताः। जयन्तो वध्यमाना वा प्राप्नुयाम च सद्गतिम्॥<br />Determined upon acquiring heaven we should fight not caring for life itself, and prepared to conquer or die, and we would attain then a blessed end in heaven!</p>
<p id='36'>एवं संशप्तशपथाः समभित्यक्तजीविताः। अमित्रवाहिनीं वीराः प्रतिगाहन्त्यभीरवः॥<br />Having taken such an oath, and prepared to cast away his itself, heroes should bravely rush against the enemy's ranks.</p>
<p id='37'>अग्रतः पुरुषानीकमसिचर्मवतां भवेत्। पृष्ठतः शकटानीकं कलत्रं मध्यतस्तथा॥<br />In the van should be posted a detachment of men armed with swords and shields. In the rear should be planted the car-division. In the interstice should be placed other classes of warriors.</p>
<p id='38'>परेषां प्रतिघातार्थं पदातीनां च बृंहणम्। अपि तस्मिन् पुरे वृद्धा भवेयुर्ये पुरोगमाः॥<br />This should be the arrangement for attacking the enemy. The veterans of the army should fight in the van. They would protect their comrades in the rear.</p>
<p id='39'>ये पुरस्तादभिमताः सत्त्ववन्तो मनस्विनः। ते पूर्वमभिवर्तेरंश्चैतानेवेतरे जनाः॥<br />Those who are the foremost of strength and courage, should be placed in the van. The others should stand behind them.</p>
<p id='40'>अपि चोद्धर्षणं कार्य भीरूणामपि यलतः। स्कन्धदर्शनमात्रात्तु तिष्ठेयुर्वा समीपतः॥<br />The fear-stricken should, with care, be comforted and encouraged. These weaker combatants should be placed on the field only to show the number of the army to the foe.</p>
<p id='41'>संहतान् योधयेदल्पान् कामं विस्तारयेद् बहून्। सूचीमुखमनीकं स्यादल्पानां बहुभिः सह॥<br />If the troops are few, they should be arranged closely for the fight. When necessary, if their leader wishes, the close arrangement may be extended wide. When a small number of soldiers is to fight with a great many, they should be arranged like a needle-point.</p>
<p id='42'>सम्प्रयुक्ते निकृष्टे वा सत्यं वा यदि वानृतम्। प्रगृह्य बाहून् क्रोशते भग्ना भग्नाः परे इति॥<br />When a small army is engaged with a larger one, the leader of the former may shake hands with his men and cry aloud, saying,-The enemy is routed! The enemy is routed!</p>
<p id='43'>आगतं मे मित्रबलं प्रहरध्वमभीतवत्। सत्त्ववन्तोऽभिधावेयुः कुर्वन्तो भैरवान् रवान्॥<br />The strong amongst them should resist the enemy, loudly saying to their comrades, Fresh friends have arrived! Fearlessly strike at your enemies!</p>
<p id='44'>क्ष्वेडा: किलकिलाशब्दाः क्रकचा गोविषाणिकाः। भेरीमृदङ्गपणवान नादयेयुः पुरश्चरान्॥<br />Those who have gone in advance should utter loud shouts and make various kinds of noises and should blow and beas Krakachas, cow-horns, drums, cymbals, and kettle-drums.'</p>
