<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 82</h3><h4>The second means described</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच एषा प्रथमतो वृत्तिद्वितीयां शृणु भारत। यः कश्चिज्जनयेदर्थं राज्ञा रक्ष्यः सदा नरः॥<br />Bhishma said This that I have told you is the first means. Listen now, O Bharata, to the second one. That man who seeks the advancement of the king should always be protected by him.</p>
<p id='2'>ह्रियमाणममात्येन भृत्यो वा यदि वा भृतः। यो राजकोशं नश्यन्तमाचक्षीत युधिष्ठिर॥ श्रोतव्यमस्य च रहो रक्ष्यश्चामात्यतो भवेत्। अमात्या ह्यपहर्तारो भूयिष्ठं मन्ति भारत॥<br />If a person O Yudhishthira, who is paid or not, comes to you for informing you of the damage done to your treasury when its contents are being embezzled by a minister, you should grant him an audience in private and protect him also from the minister. The minister guilty of embezzlement seek, O Bharata, to kill such informants.</p>
<p id='3'>राजकोशस्य गोप्तारं राजकोशविलोपकाः। समेत्य सर्वे बाधन्ते स विनश्यत्यरक्षितः॥<br />They who plunder the royal treasury combine together for opposing the person who tries to protect it, and if the latter be left unprotected, he is sure to be destroyed.</p>
<p id='4'>अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। मुनिः कालकवृक्षीयः कौसल्यं यदुवाच ह॥<br />Regarding it an old story also is cited of what the sage Kalakavrikshiya har said to the king of Koshala.</p>
<p id='5'>कोसलानामाधिपत्यं सम्प्राप्तं क्षेमदशि मुनिः कालकवृक्षीय आजगामेति नः श्रुतम्॥<br />We have heard that once on a time the sage Kalakavrikshiya came to Kshemadarshin, who had ascended the throne of Koshala.</p>
<p id='6'>स काकं पञ्जरे बद्ध्वा विषयं क्षेमदर्शिनः। सर्वं पर्यचरद् युक्तः प्रवृत्त्यर्थी पुनः पुनः॥<br />Desirous of examining the conduct of all the officers of Kshemadarshin, the sage, with a crow kept with in cage in his hand, travelled again and again through every part of that king's dominions.</p>
<p id='7'>अधीध्वं वायसी विद्यां शंसन्ति मम वायसाः। अनागतमतीतं च यच्च सम्प्रति वर्तते॥<br />men And he spoke to all the and said,-Study ye the practice of crows! The crows tell me the present, the past, and the future!</p>
<p id='8'>इति राष्ट्रे परिपतन् बहुभिः पुरुषैः सह। सर्वेषां राजयुक्तानां दुष्करं परिदृष्टवान्॥<br />Proclaiming this in the kingdom, the sage, accompanied by a large number of men, began to mark the misdeeds of all the state officers.</p>
<p id='9'>स बुद्ध्वा तस्य राष्ट्रस्य व्यवसायं हि सर्वशः। राजयुक्तापहारांश्च सर्वान् बुद्ध्वा ततस्ततः॥ ततः स काकमादाय राजानं द्रष्टुमागमत्। सर्वज्ञोऽस्मीति वचनं ब्रुवाणः संशितव्रतः॥ स स्म कौसल्यमागम्य राजामात्यमलंकृतम्। प्राह काकस्य वचनादमुत्रेदं त्वया कृतम्॥ असौ चासौ च जानीते राजकोशस्त्वया हतः। एवमाख्याति काकोऽयं तच्छीघ्रमनुगम्यताम्॥<br />Having ascertained all the affairs of the state, and having learnt that all the officers, appointed by the king were guilty of misdeeds, the sage, with his crow, came to see the king. Of rigid vows, he said to the king,-I know everything. Coming to the king, he said to his minister holding the insignia of his office that he had been informed by his crow that the minister had done such a crime in such a place, and that such and such persons know that he had robbed the royal treasury! My crow tells me this. Admit or prove the falsehood of the charge speedily.</p>
<p id='10'>तथान्यानपि स प्राह राजकोशहरांस्तदा। न चास्य वचनं किंचिदनृतं श्रूयते क्वचित्॥<br />The sage then mentioned the names of other officers who had likewise been guilty of embezzlement, adding,-My crow never says anything false!</p>
<p id='11'>तेन विप्रकृताः सर्वे राजयुक्ताः कुरूद्वह। तमस्यभिप्रसुप्तस्य निशि काकमवेधयन्॥<br />Thus accused and injured by the sage, all the officers of the king, O you of Kuru's race, in a body pierced his crow, while the sage slept at night.</p>
<p id='12'>वायसं तु विनिर्भिन्नं दृष्ट्वा बाणेन पञ्जरे। पूर्वाह्ने ब्राह्मणो वाक्यं क्षेमदर्शिनमब्रवीत्॥ राजंस्त्वामभयं याचे प्रभुं प्राणधनेश्वरम्। अनुज्ञातस्त्वया ब्रूयां वचनं भवतो हितम्॥<br />Seeing his crow pierced with a shaft within the cage, the twice-born Rishi going to Kshemadarshin in the morning said to hiin,-O king, I seek your help. You are all powerful and you are the lord of the lives and riches of all! If you permit me I can then say what is for your well-bring. Sorry for you whom I regard as a friend, I have come to you, impelled by my devotion and ready to serve you with my whole heart.</p>
<p id='13'>मित्रार्थमभिसंतप्तो भक्त्या सर्वात्मनाऽऽगतः। अयं तवार्थो ह्रियते यो ब्रूयादक्षमान्वितः॥<br />You are being robbed of your wealth, I have come to you for disclosing it without showing any mercy for the robbers. Like a driver that urges a good horse, I have come here for awakening you whom I consider a friend.</p>
<p id='14'>सम्बुबोधयिषुर्मित्रं सदश्वमिव सारथिः। अतिमन्युप्रसक्तो हि प्रसह्य हितकारणात्॥<br />A friend who knows his own interests and seeks his own prosperity and advancement, should forgive a friend that intruded himself forcibly, actuated by devotion at anger, for doing what is beneficial.</p>
<p id='15'>तथाविधस्य सुहृदा क्षन्तव्यं स्वं विजानता। ऐश्वर्यमिच्छता नित्यं पुरुषेण बुभूषता॥<br />The king replied to him, saying,—Why should I not hear anything which you will say, since I am not blind to what is for my good?</p>
<p id='16'>तं राजा प्रत्युवाचेदं यत् किंचिन्मां भवान् वदेत्। कस्मादहं न क्षमेयमाकाङ्क्षन्नात्मनो हितम्॥<br />I grant you permission, O twice-born one! Tell me what you like. I shall certainly obey your instructions, O Brahmana!</p>
<p id='17'>ब्राह्मण प्रतिजाने ते प्रब्रूहि यदिहेच्छसि। करिष्यामि हि ते वाक्यं यदस्मान्विप्र वक्ष्यसि॥<br />The Sage said, Ascertaining the merits and demerits of your servants, as also the dangers which you may meet with at their hands, I have come to you, actuated by my devotion, for informing you of everything.</p>
<p id='18'>प्रागेवोक्तस्तु दोषोऽयमाचार्यैर्नृपसेविनाम्। अगतीकगतिझैषा पापा राजोपसेविनाम्॥<br />The ancient preceptors have declared what the curses are, O king, of those that serve others. The lot of those that serve the king is very miserable and wretched.</p>
<p id='19'>आशीविषैश्च तस्याहुः संगतं यस्य राजभिः। बहुमित्राश्च राजानो बह्वमित्रास्तथैव च॥<br />He who has any connection with kings is said to have connection with snakes of deadly venom. Kings have many friends as also many enemies.</p>

<p id='21'>नैकान्तेन प्रमादो हि शक्यः कर्तुं महीपतौ। न तु प्रमादः कर्तव्यः कथंचिद् भूतिमिच्छता॥<br />A person serving the king cannot escape the charge of carelessness in doing the king's work. Indeed, a servant who desires to acquire prosperity should never show carelessness in the discharge of his duties.</p>
<p id='22'>मुनिरुवाच ज्ञात्वा पापानपापांश्च भृत्यतस्ते भयानि च। भक्त्या वृत्तिं समाख्यातुं भवतोऽन्तिकमागमम्॥<br />His carelessness may create the king's anger, and such anger may bring about his destruction. Carefully learning how to behave himself, one should sit before the king as he should in the presence of a burning fire.</p>
<p id='23'>आशीविषमिव क्रुद्धं प्रभुं प्राणधनेश्वरम्। यत्नेनोपचरेन्नित्यं नाहमस्मीति मानवः॥<br />Prepared to give up his life itself at every moment, one should serve the king attentively, for the king is all powerful and lord of the lives and the riches of all, and, therefore, like to a snake of deadly venom.</p>
<p id='24'>प्रमादाद्धि स्खलेद् राजा स्वलिते नास्ति जीवितम्। अग्नि दीप्तमिवासीदेद् राजानमुपशिक्षितः॥<br />He should always fear to utter evil words before the king, or to sit cheerlessly or in disrespectful postures, or to walk disdainfully, or to show insolent gestures and disrespectful motions of the limbs.</p>

<p id='26'>देवतेव हि सर्वार्थान् कुर्याद् राजा प्रसादितः। वैश्वानर इव क्रुद्धः समूलमपि निर्दहेत्॥<br />This, O king, was said by Yama. Its truth is seen in the wordly affairs. I shall now do what would increase your prosperity.</p>
<p id='27'>इति राजन् यमः प्राह वर्तते च तथैव तत्। अथ भूयांसमेवार्थं करिष्यामि पुनः पुनः॥<br />Friends like ourselves can give to friends like you the help of their intelligence in times of danger. This crow of mine, O king, has been killed for doing your business.</p>
<p id='28'>ददात्यस्मद्विधोऽमात्यो बुद्धिसाहाय्यमापदि। वायसस्त्वेष मे राजन् ननु कार्याभिसंहितः॥ न च मेऽत्र भवान् गर्यो न च येषां भवान्<br />I cannot, however, blame you for this. You are not loved by those who have killed this bird. Ascertain who are your friends and who, your foes. Do everything yourself without handing over your intelligence to others.</p>
<p id='29'>हिताहितांस्तु बुद्ध्येथा मा परोक्षमतिर्भवे: :॥ ये त्वादानपरा एव वसन्ति भवतो गृहे।<br />Your establishment consists of all miscreants. They do not seek the well-being of your subjects. I have incurred their hostility.</p>

<p id='31'>आन्तरैरभिसंधाय राजन् सिद्ध्यति नान्यथा॥ तेषामहं भयाद् राजन् गमिष्याम्यन्यमाश्रमम्। तैर्हि मे संधितो बाणः काके निपतितः प्रभो॥<br />Through fear of those men, O king, I shall leave this kingdom for some other hermitage. I have no worldly desire, yet those deceitful persons have shot this arrow at my crow, and have, O lord, sent the bird to Yama's abode. I have seen this, O king, with eyes whose vision has been improved by ascetic penances.</p>
<p id='32'>छाकामैरकामस्य गमितो यमसादनम्। दृष्टं ह्येतन्मया राजंस्तपोदीर्धेन चक्षुषा॥<br />With the help of this single crow I have crossed this kingdom of yours that is like a river consisting of alligators, shark, crocodiles and whales.</p>
<p id='33'>बहुनक्रझषग्राहां तिमिङ्गिलगणैर्युताम्। काकेन बालिशेनेमां यामतार्षमहं नदीम्॥<br />Indeed, with the help of that bird, I have passed through your dominions like Himalayan valley, impenetrable and inaccessible for these trunks of (fallen) trees and scattered rocks and thorny shrubs and lions and tigers and other beasts of prey.</p>
<p id='34'>स्थाण्वश्मकण्टकवर्ती सिंहव्याघ्रसमाकुलाम्। दुरासदां दुष्प्रसहां गुहां हैमवतीमिव॥<br />The learned hold that a region inaccessible for darkness can be passed through with the a help of a light, and an unfordable river can be crossed by means of a boat. No means, however, exist for penetrating through the labyrinth of royal affairs.</p>
<p id='35'>अग्निना तामसं दुर्गं नौभिराप्यं च गम्यते। राजदुर्गावतरणे नोपायं पण्डिता तिदुः॥<br />Your kingdom is like an inaccessible forest covered with darkness. You cannot trust it. How then can I.</p>
<p id='36'>गहनं भवतो राज्यमन्धकारं तमोऽन्वितम्। नेह विश्वसितुं शक्यं भवतापि कुतो मया॥<br />Good and evil are seen here in the same light. To live here is not, therefore, safe. Here a righteous person meets with death, while an unrighteous man incurs no danger.</p>
<p id='37'>अतो नायं शुभो वासस्तुल्ये सदसती इह। बधो ह्येवात्र सुकृते दुष्कृते न च संशयः॥<br />For the sake of justice, a person of unrighteous deeds should be killed but never one who is righteous in his deeds. It is not proper, therefore, for one to live in this kingdom long. A sensible man should leave this country soon.</p>
<p id='38'>न्यायतो दुष्कृते घात: सुकृते न कथंचन। नेह युक्तं स्थिरं स्थातुं जवेनैवाव्रजेद् बुधः॥ सीता नाम नदी राजन् प्लवो यस्यां निमज्जति। तथोपमामिमां मन्ये वागुरां सर्वघातिनीम्॥<br />There is a river, O king, of the name of Sita. Boats sink in it. This your kingdom is like that river. An all-destructive net appears to have been cast around it.</p>

Your nature now resembles that of dishonest men and not that of the good. You are like a pit, o king, abounding with snakes of deadly venom.</p>
<p id='40'>नदी मधुरपानीया यथा राजंस्तथा भवान्। श्वगृध्रगोमायुयुतो राजहंससमो ह्यसि॥<br />You resemble, O king, a river full of sweet water but difficult of access, with steep banks overgrown with Kariras and thorny canes. You are like a swan in the midst of dogs, vultures, and jackals.</p>
<p id='41'>यथाऽऽश्रित्य महावृक्षं कक्षः संवर्धते महान्। ततस्तं संवृणोत्येव तमतीत्य च वर्धते॥ तेनैयोगेन्धनेनैनं दावो दहति दारुणः। तथोपमा ह्यमात्यास्ते राजस्तान् परिशोधय॥<br />Parasites, supported by a huge tree, grow luxuriously, and at last covering the tree itself overshadow it entirely. A forest fire sets in, and catching those grasses first, consumes the tree with them. Thy ministers, O king, resemble those parasites of which I speak, Do you check and correct them.</p>

Reflecting upon everything, do you guide me in such a way that I may acquire prosperity!</p>
<p id='51'>अदर्शयनिमं दोषमेकैकं दुर्बलीकुरु। ततः कारणमाज्ञाय पुरुषं पुरुषं जहि॥<br />The sage said Closing your eyes first of all to this offence of theirs, do you weaken them one by one. Prove their faults then and punish them one after another.</p>
