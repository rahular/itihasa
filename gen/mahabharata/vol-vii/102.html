<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 1O2</h3><h4>The signs of a future success</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच जयित्र्याः कानि रूपाणि भवन्ति भरतर्षभ। पृतनायाः प्रशस्तानि तानि चेच्छामि वेदितुम्॥<br />Yudhishthira said What are the well-known signs, O foremost of Bharata's race, of the future success of an army? I wish to know them.</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच जयित्र्या यानि रूपाणि भवन्ति भरतर्षभ। पृतनाया:प्रशस्तानि तानि वक्ष्यामि सर्वशः॥<br />Bhishma said I shall tell you, O foremost of Bharata's race, all the well-known marks of the (future) success of an army?</p>
<p id='3'>दैवे पूर्वं प्रकुपिते मानुषे कालचोदिते। तद्विद्वांसोऽनुपश्यन्ति ज्ञानदिव्येन चक्षुषा॥ प्रायश्चित्तविधिं चात्र जपहोमांश्च तद्विदः। मङ्गलानि च कुर्वन्ति शमयन्त्यहितानि च॥<br />When the gods become angry and men are impelled by Destiny, learned persons, seeing cverything with the eye of divine knowledge, perform various auspicious acts and expiatory rites including Homa and the silent recitation of Mantras, and thus counteract all evils.</p>
<p id='4'>उदीर्णमनसो योधा वाहनानि च भारत। यस्यां भवन्ति सेनायां ध्रुवं तस्यां परो जयः॥<br />That army in which the troops and the animals are all hearty and cheerful, O Bharata is sure to gain a decided success.</p>
<p id='5'>अन्वेतान् वायवो यान्ति तथैवेन्द्रधनूंषि च। अनुप्लवन्तो मेघाश्च तथाऽऽदित्यस्य रश्मयः॥<br />The wind blows favourably from behind such troops. Rainbows appear in the sky. The clouds cast their shadows upon them and occasionally the sun shines upon them.</p>
<p id='6'>गोमायवश्चानुकूला बलगृध्राश्च सर्वशः। अर्हयेयुर्यदा सेनां तदा सिद्धिरनुत्तमा।।७।<br />The jackals, ravens and vultures become auspicious to them. When these show such regard to the army, great success is sure to be achieved by it.</p>
<p id='7'>प्रसन्नभाः पावकचोर्ध्वरश्मिः प्रदक्षिणावर्तशिखो विधूमः। पुण्या गन्धाश्चाहुतीनां भवन्ति जयस्यैतद् भाविनो रूपमाहुः॥<br />Their sacrificial fires burn up with a pure splendour, the light going upwards and the smokeless flames slightly bending towards the south. The libations poured thereon send out a sweet smell. These are the marks of future success.</p>
<p id='8'>गम्भीरशब्दाश्च महास्वनाश्च शङ्खाश्च भेर्यश्च नदन्ति यत्र। युयुत्सवश्चाप्रतीपा भवन्ति जयस्यैतद् भाविनो रूपमाहुः॥<br />The conchs and drums blown and beat, send forth loud and deep peals. The warriors become filled with confidence. These are the marks of future success.</p>
<p id='9'>इष्टा मृगाः पृष्ठतो वामतश्च सम्प्रस्थितानां च गमिष्यतां चा जिघांसतां दक्षिणाः सिद्धिमार्छ ये त्वग्रतस्ते प्रतिषेधन्ति॥<br />If deer and other quadrupeds be seen behind or to the left of those that have already started for battle or of those that are about to start, they are regarded auspicious. If they appear to the right of the warriors about to engage in slaughter, it is considered as a mark of success. If, however, they appear in the van of such persons, they presage disaster and defeat.</p>
<p id='10'>माङ्गल्यशब्दाशकुना वदन्ति हंसाः क्रौञ्चा: शतपत्राश्च चाषा:। हृष्टा योधाः सत्त्ववन्तो भवन्ति जयस्यैतद् भाविनो रूपमाहुः॥<br />If the birds, swans, cranes, Shatapatras and Chashas utter auspicious cries, and all the ablebodied warriors become cheerful, these are considered as marks of future success.</p>
<p id='11'>शस्त्रैर्यन्त्रैः कवचैः केतुभिश्च सुभानुभिर्मुखवणैश्च यूनाम्। भ्राजिष्मती दुष्प्रतिवीक्षणीया येषां चमूस्तेऽभिभवन्ति शत्रून्॥<br />They, whose arrangement shines forth and becomes terrible to look at for the lustre of their weapons, machines, armour, and standards, as also for the shining hue of the faces of the strong men which compose it, always succeed in defeating their enemies.</p>
<p id='12'>शुश्रूषवश्चानभिमानिनश्च परस्परं सौहृदमास्थिताश्च। येषां योधाः शौचमनुष्ठिताश्च जयस्यैतद् भाविनो रूपमाहुः॥<br />If the warriors of an army be of pure conduct and modest manner and treat one another with loving kindness, it is regarded as a mark of future success.</p>
<p id='13'>शब्दाः स्पर्शास्तथा गन्धा विचरन्ति मनः प्रियाः। धैर्यं चाविशते योधान् विजयस्य मुखं च तत्॥<br />If sweet sounds and odours and sensations of touch prevail, and if the warriors are filled with gratitude and patience, it is regarded as the root of success.</p>
<p id='14'>इष्टो वामः प्रविष्टस्य दक्षिणः प्रविविक्षतः। पश्चात्संसाधयत्यर्थं पुरस्ताच्च निषेधति॥<br />The crow on the left of person engaged in battle and on the right of him who is about to engage in it, is considered auspicious. Appearing at the back, it presages the nonfulfilment of the objects in view, while its appearance in the front indicates danger.</p>
<p id='15'>सम्भृत्य महतीं सेनां चतुरङ्गां युधिष्ठिर। साम्नैव वर्तयेः पूर्वं प्रयतेथास्ततो युधि॥<br />Even after enlisting a large army consisting of the fourfold forces, you should, O Yudhishthira, first behave peacefully. If your attempts to secure peace fail, then you may engaged in battle.</p>
<p id='16'>जघन्य एष विजयो यद् युद्धं नाम भारत। यादृच्छिकोयुधि जयो दैवो वेति विचारणम्॥<br />The victory, O Bharata, that one gains by battle is very inferior. Victory in battle, depends on caprice or destiny.</p>
<p id='17'>अपामिव महावेगस्त्रस्ता इव महामृगाः। दुनिवार्यतमा चैव प्रभग्ना महती चमूः॥<br />When a large army is routed and the troops begin to fly away, it is highly difficult to restrain their flight. The force of the fight resembles that of a mighty current of water of a frightened herd of deer.</p>
<p id='18'>भग्ना इत्येव भज्यन्ते विद्वांसोऽपि न कारणम्। उदारसारा महती रुरुसंघोपमा चमूः॥<br />Seeing some routed, others, even through they are brave and skilled in fight, break without sufficient cause. A larger army, consisting of brave soldiers, is like a large herd or Ruru deer.</p>
<p id='19'>परस्परज्ञाः संहृष्टास्त्यक्तप्राणाः सुनिश्चिताः। अपि पञ्चाशतं शूरा निघ्नन्ति परवाहिनीम्॥<br />Sometimes it is seen that even fifty men, firm and relying upon one another, cheerful and prepared to sacrifice their lives, succeed in grinding enemies much superior to them in number.</p>
<p id='20'>अपि वा पञ्च षट् सप्त संहताः कृतनिश्चयाः। कुलीनाः पूजिताः सम्यग् विजयन्तीह शात्रवान्॥<br />Sometimes even five, or six, or seven men, firm and standing close together, of high birth and esteemed of those that know them, defeat enemies much superior to them in number.</p>
<p id='21'>संनियातो न मन्तव्यः शक्ये सति कथंचन। सान्त्वभेदप्रदानानां युद्धमुत्तरमुच्यते॥<br />The collision of battle is not at all desirable as long as it can be avoided. The policy of conciliation, of creating disunion, and making gifts should first be tried; battle, it is said, should take place after these.</p>
<p id='22'>संदर्शेनैव सेनाया भयं भीरून् प्रबाधते। वज्रादिव प्रज्वलितादियं क्व नु पतिष्यति॥<br />On seeing a hostile army, fear paralyses the timid, as on seeing a thunderbolt they ask,-Oh upon what would it fall?</p>
<p id='23'>अभिप्रयातां समितिं ज्ञात्वा ये प्रतियान्त्यथ। तेषां स्यन्दन्ति गात्राणि योधानां विजयस्य च।॥<br />Having determined that a battle is raging, the limbs of those that go to join it, as also of him that is conquering, are covered with perspiration.</p>
<p id='24'>विषयो व्यथते राजन् सर्वः सस्थाणुजङ्गमः। अस्य प्रतापतप्तानां मज्जा सीदति देहिनाम्॥<br />The entire seat of war, O king, becomes agitated and afflicted, with all its mobile and immobile residents. The very marrow of creatures, scorched with the heat of weapons, languishes with pain.</p>
<p id='25'>तेषां सान्त्वं क्रूरमिश्रं प्रणेतव्यं पुनः पुनः। सम्पीड्यमाना हि पर्योगमायान्ति सर्वतः॥<br />A king should, therefore, at all times, use the means of conciliation, accompanied with hard measures. When people are assailed by enemies they always display a tendency to come to terms.</p>
<p id='26'>आन्तराणां च भेदार्थं चरानभ्यवचारयेत्। यश्च तस्मात् परो राजा तेन सन्धिः प्रशस्यते॥<br />Secret agents should be sent for creating disunion amongst the allies of the enemy. Having created disunion, it is very desirable that peace should then be made with that king who is more powerful than the enemy.</p>
<p id='27'>न हि तस्यान्यथा पीडा शक्या कर्तुं तथाविधा। यथा सार्धममित्रेण सर्वतः प्रतिबाधनम्॥<br />If the invader does not act thus, he can never succeed in crushing his enemy completely. In dealing with the foe, care should be taken for attacking him from all sides.</p>
<p id='28'>क्षमा वै साधुमायाति न ह्यसाधूक्षमा सदा। क्षमायाश्चाक्षमायाश्च पार्थ विद्धि प्रयोजनम्॥<br />Forgiveness always comes to the good. It never comes to the bad. Listen now, O Partha, to the uses of forgiveness and of hardness.</p>
<p id='29'>विजित्य क्षममाणस्य यशो राज्ञो विवर्धते। महापराधे हाप्यस्मिन् विश्वसन्त्यपि शत्रवः॥<br />The fame of a king who shows forgiveness after conquest spreads more widely. The very enemies of a forgiving person trust him even when he becomes guilty of a heinous crime.</p>
<p id='30'>मन्यते कर्षयित्वा तु क्षमा साध्वीति शम्बरः। असंतप्तं तु यद् दारु प्रत्येति प्रकृति पुनः॥<br />Shamvara has said that having assailed an enemy, forgiveness should be shown afterwards, for a wooden pole, if made straight without heat, very soon assumes its former state.</p>
<p id='31'>नैतत् प्रशंसन्त्याचार्या न च साधुनिदर्शनम्। अक्रोधेनाविनाशेन नियन्तव्याः स्वपुत्रवत्॥<br />Persons conversant with the scriptures do not, however, praise this. Nor do they consider this a characteristic of a good king. On the other hand, they say that an enemy should be subdued and restrained like a father subduing and checking a son, without anger and without killing him.</p>
<p id='32'>द्वेष्यो भवति भूतानामुग्रो राजा युधिष्ठिर। मृदुमप्यवमन्यन्ते तस्मादुभयमाचरेत्॥<br />If, O Yudhishthira, a king becomes severe, he is hated of all creatures. If, on the other hand, he becomes mild, he is disregarded by all. Do you, therefore, practise both severity and mildness.</p>
<p id='33'>प्रहरिष्यन् ब्रूयात् प्रहरन्नापि भारत। प्रहत्य च कृपायीत शोचन्निव रुदनिवा॥<br />Before striking, O Bharata, and while sticking, utter sweet words; and while striking, utter sweet words; and after having beaten them, show them mercy and let them understand that you are grieving and weeping for them.</p>
<p id='34'>न मे प्रियं यनिहताः संग्रामे मामकैनरैः। न च कुर्वन्ति मे वाक्यमुच्यमानाः पुनः पुनः॥<br />Having defeated an army, the king should address the survivors saying-I am not at all glad that so many have been killed by my men. Alas, the latter, through repeatedly dissuaded by me, have not obeyed my orders.</p>
<p id='35'>अहो जीवितमाकाक्षेन्नेदृशो वधमर्हति! सुदुर्लभाः सुपुरुषाः संग्रामेष्वपलायिनः॥<br />I wish they were all alive. They do not deserve such death. They were all good and sincere men, and unretreating from battle. Such inan, indeed, are rare.</p>
<p id='36'>कृतं ममाप्रियं तेन येनायं निहतो मधे। इति वाचा वदन् हन्तुन् पूजयेत रहोगतः॥<br />He that has killed such a hero in battle, has surely done that which I do not like.-Having said so before the survivors of the defeated enemy, the king should in secret honour those amongst his own troops that have bravely killed the foe.</p>
<p id='37'>हन्तृणामाहतानां च यत् कुर्युरपराधिनः। क्रोशेद् बाहुं प्रगृह्यापि चिकीर्षन् जनसंग्रहम्॥<br />For comforting the wounded slayers for their sufferings at the hand of enemy, the king, desirous of securing their devotion to himself, should even weep, catching their hands affectionately.</p>
<p id='38'>एवं सर्वास्ववस्थासु सान्त्वपूर्वं समाचरेत्। प्रियो भवति भूतानां धर्मज्ञो वीतभीनृपः॥<br />The king should thus, under all circumstances, behave with conciliation. A fearless and virtuous king, is loved by all creatures.</p>
<p id='39'>विश्वासं चात्र गच्छन्ति सर्वभूतानि भारत। विश्वस्तः शक्यते भोक्तुं यथाकाममुपस्थितः॥<br />All creatures also, O Bharata, trust such a king. Winning their confidence, he succeeds in enjoying the Earth as he pleases.</p>
<p id='40'>तस्माद् विश्वासयेद् राजा सर्वभूतान्यमायया। सर्वतः परिरक्षेच्च यो महीं भोक्तुमिच्छति॥<br />The king should, therefore, by casting off deceitfulness, seek to secure the confidence of all creatures. He should also try to protect his subjects from all fears if he seeks to enjoy the Earth.</p>
