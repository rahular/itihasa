<h3>APADDHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 136</h3><h4>How should a king fill his Treasury</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>भीष्म उवाच अत्र गाथा ब्रह्मगीताः कीर्तयन्ति पुराविदः। येन मार्गेण राजा वै कोशं संजनयत्युत॥<br />Bhishma said Regarding the way in which a king should fill his treasury, persons will read in the scriptures of olden days, cite the following verses sung by Brahmana himself.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>न धनं यज्ञशीलानां हार्यं देवस्वमेव च। दस्यूनां निष्क्रियाणां च क्षत्रियो हर्तुमर्हति॥<br />The wealth of persons who celebrate sacrifices, as also the wealth dedicated to the deities, should never be taken. A Kshatriya should take the wealth of such persons as never perform religious rites and sacrifices, and who are, therefore, considered to be equal to robbers.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>इमाः प्रजाः क्षत्रियाणां राज्यभोगाश्च भारत। धनं हि क्षत्रियस्यैव द्वितीयस्य न विद्यते॥<br />All the creatures of the Earth and all the enjoyments of sovereignty, O Bharata, belong to the Kshatriyas. All the wealth of the Earth is the Kshatriya's and not any one's else.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>तदस्य स्याद् बलार्थ वा धनं यज्ञार्थमेव च। अभोग्याश्चौषधीश्छित्त्वा भोग्या एव पचन्त्युत॥<br />The Kshatriya should use that wealth for mairtaining his army and for the celebration of sacrifices. Tearing up useless creepers and plants, men burn them for cooking vegetables of food.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>यो वै न देवान् न पितृन् न मान् हविषार्चति। अनर्थकं धनं तः प्राहुर्धर्मविदो जनाः॥<br />Men knowing duty have said that useless is his wealth who does not, with libations of clarificd butter, feed the gods, the Pitris, and men.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>हरेत् तद् द्रविणं राजन् धार्मिकः पृथिवीपतिः। ततः प्रीणयते लोकं न कोशं तद्विधं नृपः॥<br />O king, A virtuous ruler, should appropriate such riches. By that wealth, a large number of good people can be pleased. He should not, however, amass that wealth in his treasury.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>असाधुभ्योऽर्थमादाय साधुभ्यो यः प्रयच्छति। आत्मानं संक्रमं कृत्वा कृत्स्नधर्मविदेव सः॥<br />He, who is the instrument of acquisition and, taking away wealth from the wicked, gives them to those that are good, knows well the science of virtue.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>तथा तथा जयेल्लोकाशक्त्या चैव यथा यथा। उद्भिज्जा जन्तवो यद्वच्छुक्लजीवा यथा यथा॥ अनिमित्तात् सम्भवन्ति तथाऽयज्ञः प्रजायते॥<br />A king should conquer the next world according to the measure of his power, and as gradually as vegetables grow. As some ants are seen to originate from an insignificant cause, even so sacrifice springs from insufficient wealth.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>यथैव दंशमशकं यथा चाण्डपिपीलिकम्। सैव वृत्तिरयज्ञेषु यथा धर्मो विधीयते॥<br />As flies, gnats, and ants are driven off from the bodies of kine and other domestic animals, so should all persons, who are averse to the celebration of sacrifices, should be similarly driven off from the kingdom. This is quite of a piece with morality.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>यथा ह्यकस्माद् भवति भूमौ पांसुर्विलोलितः। तथैवेह भवेद् धर्मः सूक्ष्मः सूक्ष्मतरस्तथा॥<br />As being pounded between two stones, the dust becomes finer and finer, so questions of morality, the more they are discussed, becomes subtler and subtler.</p>
