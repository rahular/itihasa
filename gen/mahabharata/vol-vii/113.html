<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANAPARVA: Chapter 113</h3><h4>The conduct of a king towards a powerful enemy</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच राजा राज्यमनुप्राप्य दुर्लभं भरतर्षभ। अमित्रस्यातिवृद्धस्य कथं तिष्ठेदसाधनः॥<br />Yudhishthira said Tell me, O foremost of Bharata's race, how a king, without the usual helps, having obtained a kingdom which is so valuable a possession, should treat a powerful enemy.</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। सरितां चैव संवादं सागरस्य च भारत॥<br />Bhishma said-Regarding it is cited the old story of the discourse between the Ocean and the Rivers.</p>
<p id='3'>सुरारिनिलयः शश्वत्सागरः सरिताम्पतिः। पप्रच्छ सरितः सर्वाः संशयं जातमात्मनः॥<br />In days of yore, eternal Ocean that lord of Rivers, that refuge of the enemies of the gods, asked all the Rivers for solving this doubt that had arisen in his mind.</p>
<p id='4'>सागर उवाच समूलशाखान् पश्यामि निहतान् कायिनो दुमान्। युष्माभिरिह पूर्णाभिर्नास्तत्र न वेतसम्॥<br />The Ocean said Ye Rivers, I see that all of you, with our strong currents, wash away trees of huge trunks, with their roots and branches. You do not, however, ever bring to me a cane.</p>
<p id='5'>अकायश्चाल्पसारश्च वेतसः कूलजश्च वः। अवज्ञया वा नानीतः किं च वा तेन वः कृतम्॥<br />The canes that grow on your banks have small stems and are not strong. Do you refuse to wash them down through contempt, or are they of any utility to you?</p>
<p id='6'>तदहं श्रोतुमिच्छामि सर्वासामेव वो मतम्। यथा चेमानि कूलानि हित्वा नायाति वेतसः॥ तत्र प्राह नदी गङ्गा वाक्यमुत्तममर्थवत्। हेतुमद् ग्राहकं चैव सागरं सरिताम्पतिम्॥<br />I desire, therefore, to hear what is your motive about it. Indeed, why is it that canes, are not washed down by any of you from the banks were they grow?-Thus addressed, the River Ganga replied, to Ocean, that Lord of all Rivers, in these words of great significance, fraught with reason, and, therefore, liked of all.</p>
<p id='7'>गङ्गोवाच तिष्ठन्त्येते यथास्थान नगा टेकनिकेतनाः। ते त्यजन्ति ततः स्थान प्रातिलोम्यान्न वेतसः॥<br />Ganga said Trees stand in one and the same place and are never displaced from where they stand. For this by their nature resisting our currents, they are obliged to leave the place of their growth. Canes, however, act otherwise.</p>
<p id='8'>वेतसो वेगमायातं दृष्ट्वा नमति नापरे। सरिद्वेगेऽव्यतिक्रान्ते स्थानमासाद्य तिष्ठति॥<br />The cane, seeing the advancing current, bends to it. The others do not act in this way. After the current has passed away, the cane resumes its pristine posture.</p>
<p id='9'>कालज्ञः समयज्ञश्च सदा वश्यश्च नोद्धतः। अनुलोमस्तथास्तब्धस्तेन नाभ्येति वेतसः॥<br />The cane is acquainted with the virtues of Time and opportunity. It is docile and obedient. It is yielding, but not stiff. Therefore, it stands where it grows, without being compelled to follow our current.</p>
<p id='10'>मारुतोदकवेगेन ये नमन्त्युन्नमन्ति च। ओषध्यः पापदा गुल्मा न ते यान्ति पराभवम्॥<br />Those plants, trees, and creepers that bend and rise before the force of wind and water, are never rooted out.</p>
<p id='11'>भीष्म उवाच यो हि शत्रोविवृद्धस्य प्रभोर्बन्धविनाशने। पूर्वं न सहते वेगं क्षिप्रमेव विनश्यति॥<br />Bhishma said-That person, who does not yield to the power of a powerful foe who has grown and who is competent to imprison or kill, soon meets with ruin.</p>
<p id='12'>सारासारं बलं वीर्यमात्मनो द्विषतश्च यः। जानन् विचरति प्राज्ञो न स याति पराभवम्॥<br />That wise man, who acts after determining fully the strength and weakness, the power and energy, of himself and his enemies is never discomfitted.</p>
<p id='13'>एवमेव यदा विद्वान् मन्यतेऽतिबलं रिपुम्। संश्रयेद् वैतसी वृत्तिमेतत् प्रज्ञानलक्षणम्॥<br />An intelligent man, therefore, when he sees liis enemy to be more powerful than himself imitate the conduct of the cane. That is a sign of wisdom.</p>
