<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 1O3</h3><h4>How should a king treat his enemies</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>युधिष्ठिर उवाच कथं मृदौ कथं तीक्ष्णे महापक्षे च पार्थिव। आदौ वर्तेत नृपतिस्तन्मे ब्रूहि पितामह॥<br />Yudhishthira said Tell me, O grandfather, how should a king treat a mild foe, one who is fierce, and one who has many allies and a large army.</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>भीष्म उवाच अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्। बृहस्पतेश्च संवादमिन्द्रस्य च युधिष्ठिर॥<br />'Regarding it is cited, O Yudhishthira the old discourse between Brihaspati and Indra.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>बृहस्पति देवपतिरभिवाद्य कृताञ्जलिः। उपसंगम्य पप्रच्छ वासवः परवीरहा।॥<br />Once on a time, that destroyer of hostile heroes, viz., Vasava, the king of the gods, joining his hands, approached Brihaspati, and saluting him, said these words.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>इन्द्र उवाच अहितेषु कथं ब्रह्मन् प्रवर्तेयमतन्द्रितः। असमुच्छिद्य चैवैतान् नियच्छेयमुपायतः॥<br />Indra said How, O twice-born one, should I treat my enemies? How should I subdue them by various contrivances, without rooting them out?</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>सेनयोर्व्यतिषङ्गेण जयः साधारणो भवेत्। किंकुर्वाणं न मां जह्याज्ज्वलिता श्रीः प्रतापिनी॥<br />In a collision between two arinies, victory may be achieved by either side. In what way should I behave so that this shining prosperity that I have acquired and that scorches all my enemies, may not leave me?</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>ततो धर्मार्थकामानां कुशलः प्रतिभानवान्। राजधर्मविधानज्ञः प्रत्युवाच पुरंदरम्॥<br />Thus addressed, Brihaspati, skilled in Virtue, Profit, and Pleasure, endued with a knowledge of royal duties, and great intelligence, answered Indra as follows.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>बृहस्पतिरुवाच न जातु कलहेनेच्छेन्नियन्तुमपकारिणः। बालैरासेवितं ह्येतद् यदम! यदक्षमा॥<br />One should never wish to vanquish his enemies by quarrel. Worked up with anger and shom of forgiveness, boys only seek quarrel.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>न शत्रुर्विवृतः कार्यो वधमस्याभिकाङ्गता। क्रोधं भयं च हर्षं च नियम्य स्वयमात्मनि॥<br />One who wishes for the destruction of a foe, should not make that foe careful. On the other hand, one should never display one's anger or fear or joy. He should conceal these within his own heart.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>अमित्रमुपसेवेत विश्वस्तवदविश्वसन्। प्रियमेव वदेन्नित्यं नाप्रियं किंचिदाचरेत्॥<br />Without trusting one's foe in reality, one should treat him in such a way as if he trusted him completely. One should always speak sweet words to one's enemies and never do anything that is disagreeable.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>विरमेच्छुष्कवैरेभ्यः कण्ठायासांश्च वर्जयेत्। यथा वैतंसिको युक्तो द्विजानां सदृशस्वनः॥ तान् द्विजान् कुरुते वश्यांस्तथा युक्तो महीपतिः। वशं चोपनयेच्छन् निहन्याच्च पुरंदर॥<br />One should avoid useless acts of hostility as also insolent speech. As a fowler, carefully uttering cries like those of the birds he wishes to catch, or destroy, captures and brings them under his control, even so should a king, O Purandara, bring his enemies under subjection and then kill them if he likes.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>न नित्यं परिभूयारीन् सुखं स्वपिति वासव। जागर्येव हि दुष्टात्मा संकरेऽग्निरिवोत्थितः॥<br />Having defeated one's enemies, one should not sleep at ease. A wicked enemy rises up against like a fire carelessly extinguished reappearing itself.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>न संनिपातः कर्तव्यः सामान्ये विजये सति। विश्वास्यैवोपसन्नार्थो वशे कृत्वा रिपुः प्रभो॥<br />When victory may be achieved by either side, a hostile collision of arms should be avoided. Having made an enemy feel security, one should subdue him and active one's end.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>सम्प्रधार्य सहामात्यैर्मन्त्रविद्भिर्महात्मभिः। उपेक्ष्यमाणोऽवज्ञातो हृदयेनापराजितः॥ अथास्य प्रहरेत् काले किंचिद्विचलिते पदे। दण्डं च दूषयेदस्य पुरुषैराप्तकारिभिः॥<br />Having consulted his ministers and intelligent persons conversant with policy, an enemy that is disregarded and neglected, never owning submission at heart, strikes the disregarder at the proper season, especially when the latter takes a false step. By engaging trustworthy agents of his own, such an enemy would also make the other's forces inefficient by creating disunion.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>आदिमध्यावसानज्ञः प्रच्छन्नं च विधारयेत्। बलानि दूषयेदस्य जानन्नेव प्रमाणतः॥ भेदेनोपप्रदानेन संसृजेदौषधैस्तथा। न त्वेवं खलु संसर्गं रोचयेदरिभिः सह॥<br />Knowing the beginning, the middle, and the end of his enemy, a king should secretly entertain feelings of hostility towards them. He should corrupt the forces of his enemy, determine everything by positive evidence, creating disunion, making gifts, and administering poison. A king should never live with his foes.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>दीर्घकालमपीक्षेत निहन्यादेव शात्रवान्। कालाकाङ्क्षीहि क्षपयेद् यथा विश्रम्भमाप्नुयुः॥ न सद्योऽरीन् विहन्याच्च द्रष्टव्यो विजयो ध्रुवः।<br />A king should wait long and then kill his enemies. Indeed, he should wait, for the opportunity, so that he might attack his enemy at a time when the latter would not expect him in the least. A king should never kill a large number of the enemy's army, although he should certainly do that which would secure him decisive victory.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>न शल्यं वा घटयति न वाचा कुरुते व्रणम्॥ प्राप्ते न प्रहरेत् काले न च संवर्तते पुनः। हन्तुकामस्य देवेन्द्र पुरुषस्य रिपून् प्रति॥<br />The king should never do such an injury to his enemy as would remain in the latter's heart. Nor should he afflict him with wordy darts and arrows. If the opportunity comes, he should strike him, without letting it slip. In this way, O king of the gods, should a king, desirous of killing his foes, treat them.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>यो हि कालो व्यतिक्रामेत् पुरुषं कालकाक्षिणम्। दुर्लभः स पुनस्तेन कालः कर्मचिकीर्षुणा॥<br />If an opportunity, with respect to the man who waits for it, once goes away it can never be secured again by the person desirous of acting.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>ओजश्च जनयेदेव संगृह्णन् साधुसम्मतम्। अकाले साधयेन्मित्रं न च प्राप्ते प्रपीडयेत्॥<br />Acting according to the advice of the wise, a king should only break the strength of his enemy. He should never, when the opportunity is not favourable, try to achieve his end. Nor should he, when the opportunity arises, persecute his enemy.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>विहाय कामं क्रोधं च तथाहंकारमेव च। युक्तो विवरमन्विच्छेदहितानां पुनः पुनः॥<br />Giving up lust, anger and pride, the king should carefully and continually watch for the shortcomings of his foes,</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>मार्दवं दण्ड आलस्यं प्रमादश्च सुरोत्तम। मायाः सुविहिताः शक्र सादयन्त्यविचक्षणम्॥<br />His own mildness, the hardship of his punishments, his inactivity and carelessness. O king of the gods, and the deceitful means well applied (by his foes), ruin a foolish king.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>निहत्यैतानि चत्वारि मायां प्रति विधाय च। ततः शक्नोति शत्रूणां प्रहर्तुमविचारयन्॥<br />That king who can overcome these four shortcomings and counteract the deceitful expedients of his enemies, succeeds, forsooth, in smiting them all.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>यदैवैकेन शक्येत गुह्यं कर्तुं तदाचरेत्। यच्छन्ति सचिवा गुह्यं मिथो विश्रावयन्त्यपि॥<br />When only one minister is capable to perform a secret object, the king should consult with that one minister only regarding such secret object. Many ministers, if consulted, try to throw the burden of the task upon the another's shoulders and even give out that object which should be kept close.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>अशक्यमिति कृत्वा वा ततोऽन्यैः संविदं चरेत्। ब्रह्मदण्डमदृष्टेषु दृष्टेषु चतुरङ्गिणीम्॥<br />If consultation with one is not proper, then only should the king consult with many. When enemies are not seen, he should invoke divine punishment upon them; when seen, the army, consisting of fourfold forces, should be set in motion.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>भेदं च प्रथमं युज्यात् तूष्णीं दण्डं तथैव च। काले प्रयोजयेद् राजा तस्मिंस्तस्मिंस्तदा तदा॥<br />The king should first use the means of creating disunion, as also those of conciliation. When the time for each particular means arrives, that particular expedient should be made use of.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>प्रणिपातं च गच्छेत काले शत्रोर्बलीयसः। युक्तोऽस्य वधमन्विच्छेदप्रमत्तः प्रमाद्यतः॥<br />Occasionally the king should even prostrate himself before a powerful enemy. It is again desirable that acting with every care, he should try to bring about the victor's destruction when the latter becomes careless.</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>प्रणिपातेन दानेन वाचा मधुरया ब्रूवन्। अमित्रमपि सेवेत न च जातु विशङ्कयेत्।।३<br />By prostrating one's self, by giving tribute, by uttering sweet words, one should humble one's self before a more powerful king. One should never do anything that may create the suspicions of one's powerful enemy.</p>
<p id='27'><a href='#27'></a>स्थानानि शङ्कितानां च नित्यमेव विवर्जयेत्। न च तेष्वाश्वसेद् राजा जाग्रतीह निराकृताः॥<br />The weaker king should, under such circumstances, carefully avoid every act that may create suspicion. A victorious king, again, should not trust his defeated enemies, for the vanquished always remain alert.</p>
<p id='28'><a href='#28'></a>न ह्यतो दुष्करं कर्म किंचिदस्ति सुरोत्तमा यथा विविधवृत्तानामैश्वर्यममराधिप।॥<br />There is nothing, O best of gods, that is more difficult to be done than the acquisition of prosperity, O king of gods, by restless persons.</p>
<p id='29'><a href='#29'></a>तथा विविधवृत्तानामपि सम्भव उच्यते। यतते योगमास्थाय मित्रामित्रं विचारयेत्॥<br />The very existence of restless persons is dangerous. Kings should, therefore, with minute attention, determine their friends, and enemies.</p>
<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>मृदुमप्यवमन्यन्ते तीक्ष्णादुद्विजते जनः मा तीक्ष्णो मा मृदुर्भूस्त्वं तीक्ष्णो भव मृदुर्भव॥<br />A mild king is always disregarded. If he becomes fierce, i.e., strikes people with fear. Therefore do not be fierce. Do not, again, be mild. But be both fierce and mild.</p>
<p id='31'><a href='#31'></a>यथा वप्रे वेगवति सर्वतः सम्प्लुतोदके। नित्यं विवरणाद् बाधस्तथा राज्यं प्रमाद्यतः॥<br />As a rapid current ceaselessly washes away the high bank and causes large landslips, so carelessness and mistake bring about the ruination of a kingdom.</p>
<p id='32'><a href='#32'></a>न बहूनभियुञ्जीत यौगपद्येन शात्रवान्। साम्ना दानेन भेदेन दण्डेन च पुरंदर॥ एकैकमेषां निष्पिष्य शिष्टेषु निपुणं चरेत्। न तु शक्तोऽपि मेधावी सर्वानेवारभेन्नृपः॥<br />Never attack many enemies simultaneously. By using the means of conciliation, or of gift, or of creation of disunion. O Purandara, they should be assailed one by one. The victor may treat peacefully the remnant. An intelligent king, even if competent for it, should not begin to crush all simultaneously.</p>
<p id='33'><a href='#33'></a>यदास्यान्महती सेना हयनागरथाकुला। पदातियन्त्रबहुला अनुरक्ता षडगिनी॥ यदा बहुविधां वृद्धिं मन्येत प्रतिलोमतः। तदा विवृत्य प्रहरेद् दस्यूनामविचारयन्॥<br />When a king happens to have a large army consisting of sixfold forces and enough of horse, elephant, cars, foot, and engines, all devoted to him, when he thinks himself superior to his enemies in many respects upon a fair comparison, then should he openly strike the enemy without hesitation.</p>
<p id='34'><a href='#34'></a>न सामदण्डोपनिषत् प्रशस्यते न मार्दवं शत्रुषु यात्रिकं सदा। न सस्यघातो न च संकरक्रिया न चापि भूयः प्रकृतेर्विचारणा॥<br />If the enemy be strong, the adoption of a policy of conciliation is not good. On the other hand, punishment by secret means should be inflicted. Such enemies shouid not be treated mildly, repeated attacks, destruction of crops, poisoning of wells and tanks, and suspicion regarding the seven branches of administration, should be made.</p>
<p id='35'><a href='#35'></a>मायाविभेदानुपसर्जनानि तथैव पापं न यशःप्रयोगात्। आप्तैर्मनुष्यरूपचारयेत पुरेषु राष्ट्रेषु च सम्प्रयुक्तान्॥<br />The king should, on such occasions, adopt various kinds of deception, various expedients for setting his foes against one another, and various kinds of hypocrisy. He should also, through trusted agents, learn the doings of his enemies in their cities and provinces.</p>
<p id='36'><a href='#36'></a>पुरापि चैषामनुसृत्य भूमिपाः पुरेषु भोगानखिलान् जयन्ति। पुरेषु नीति विहितां यथाविधि प्रयोजयन्तो बलवृत्रसूदन॥<br />Kings, O killer of Vala and Vritra, pursuing their enemies and entering their towers, seize and appropriate the best things that are to be had there, and adopt proper measures of policy in their own cities and dominions.</p>
<p id='37'><a href='#37'></a>प्रदाय गूढानि वसूनी राजन् प्रच्छिद्य भोगानवधाय च स्वान्। दुष्टान् स्वदोषैरिति कीर्तयित्वा पुरेषु राष्ट्रेषु च योजयन्ति॥<br />Presenting them wealth privately, and confiscating their properties publicly, without, however, injuring them materially, and proclaiming that they are all wicked men who have suffered for their own misdeeds, kings should despatch their agents to the cities and provinces of their enemies.</p>
<p id='38'><a href='#38'></a>तथैव चान्यैरपि शास्त्रवेदिभिः स्वलंकृतैः शास्त्रविधानदृष्टिभिः। सुशिक्षितैर्भाष्यकथाविशारदैः परेषु कृत्यामुपधारयेच्च॥<br />At the same time, in their own cities, they should, through other persons well-read in scriptures, endued with every accomplishment, acquainted with the injunctions of the sacred books; and possessed of learning, cause incantations, and foe-destroying rites to be performed.</p>
<p id='39'><a href='#39'></a>इन्द्र उवाच कानि लिङ्गानि दुष्टस्य भवन्ति द्विजसत्तम। कथं दुष्टं विजानीयामेतत् पृष्टो वदस्व मे॥<br />What are the marks, O best of the twiceborn, of a wicked person! Accosted by me, tell me how am I to know who is wicked!</p>
<p id='40'><a href='#40'></a>बृहस्पतिरुवाच परोक्षमगुणानाह सद्गुणानभ्यसूयते। परैर्वा कीर्त्यमानेषु तूष्णीमास्ते पराङ्मुखः॥<br />Brihaspati said A wicked person is he who speaks of the faults of others at their back, who is filled with envy on seeing the accomplishments of others, and who remains silent when the merits of other people are described before him, being most unwilling to join them.</p>
<p id='41'><a href='#41'></a>तूष्णीम्भावेऽपि विज्ञेयं न चेद्भवति कारणम्। निःश्वासं चोष्ठसंदंशं शिरसश्च प्रकम्पनम्॥<br />Mere silence is no mark of wickedness on such occasions. A wicked person breathes heavily, bites his lips, and snakes his head.</p>
<p id='42'><a href='#42'></a>करोत्यभीक्ष्णं संसृष्टमसंसृष्टश्च भाषते। अदृष्टितो न कुरुते दृशे नैवाभिभाषते॥<br />Such a person always mixes in society and talks irrelevantly. Such a man never does what he promises, when the person to whom he has given the assurance does not observe him. When this man observes him, the wicked man does not even refer to the subject.</p>
<p id='43'><a href='#43'></a>पृथगेत्य समश्नाति नेदमद्य यथाविधि। आसने शयने याने भावा लक्ष्या विशेषतः॥<br />The wicked man eats alone, and finds fault with the food placed before him, saying.-All is not right to-day, as before. His true nature comes out when sitting, lying down, and riding.</p>
<p id='44'><a href='#44'></a>आर्तिराते प्रिये प्रीतिरेतावन्मित्रलक्षणम्। विपरीतं तु बोद्धव्यमरिलक्षणमेव तत्॥<br />Lamenting in times of sorrow and rejoicing in times of joy are the marks of a friend, Contrary actions from the indications of an enemy.</p>
<p id='45'><a href='#45'></a>एतान्येव यथोक्तानि बुध्येथास्त्रिदशाधिप। पुरुषाणां प्रदुष्टानां स्वभावो बलवत्तरः॥<br />Keep in your heart these sayings, O king of the gods! The nature of wicked men can never be concealed.</p>
<p id='46'><a href='#46'></a>इति दुष्टस्य विज्ञानमुक्तं ते सुरसत्तम। निशम्य शास्त्रतत्त्वार्थं यथावदमरेश्वर॥<br />I have now told you, O foremost of gods, what are the marks of a wicked person. Having listened to the truths given but in the scriptures, follow them duly, O king of the gods!</p>
<p id='47'><a href='#47'></a>भीष्म उवाच स तद्वचः शत्रुनिबर्हणे रत स्तथा चकारावितथं बृहस्पतेः। चचार काले विजयाय चारिहा वशं च शत्रूननयत् पुरंदरः॥<br />Bhishma said Having heard these words of Brihaspati, Purandara, engaged in defeating his foes, followed them strictly. Bent upon victory, that destroyer of foes, when the opportunity came, followed these instructions and subdued all his enemies!'</p>
