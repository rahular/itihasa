<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 93</h3><h4>How should a king guard himself</h4><p id='1'>वामदेव उवाच यत्राधर्मं प्रणयते दुर्बले बलवत्तरः। तां वृत्तिमुपजीवन्ति ये भवन्ति तदन्वयाः॥<br />When the king, who is powerful acts unfairly towards the Weak, persons born in his family imitate the same conduct.</p>
<p id='2'>राजानमनुवर्तन्ते तं पापाभिप्रवर्तकम्। अविनीतमनुष्यं तत् क्षिप्रं राष्ट्र विनश्यति॥<br />Others, again, imitate that wretch who commits sins. Such imitation of the man who does not care for restraints soon brings destruction upon the kingdom.</p>
<p id='3'>यद् वृत्तमुपजीवन्ति प्रकृतिस्थस्य मानवाः। तदेव विषमस्थस्य स्वजनोऽपि न मृष्यते॥<br />The conduct of a king, who observes his proper duties, is accepted by men in general as a model for imitation. The conduct, however, of a king, who deviates from his duties, is not tolerated by his very kinsmen.</p>
<p id='4'>साहसप्रकृतिर्यत्र किंचिदुल्बणमाचरेत्। अशास्त्रलक्षणो राजा क्षिप्रमेव विनश्यति॥<br />That rash king, who, neglecting the injunctions laid down in scriptures, acts with high-handedness in his kingdom, very soon meets with fall.</p>
<p id='5'>योऽत्यन्ताचरितां वृत्तिं क्षत्रियो नानुवर्तते। जितानामजितानां च क्षत्रधर्मादपैति सः॥<br />That Kshatriya, who does not follow the conduct observed from days of yore by other Kshatriyas conquered or unconquered, deviates from Kshatriyas duties.</p>
<p id='6'>द्विषन्त कृतकल्याणं गृहीत्वा नृपतिं रणे। यो न मानयते द्वेषात् क्षत्रधर्मादपैति सः॥<br />Having captured in battle a royal enemy that did some good to the conqueror on a former occasion, that king, who, does not, out of malice, honour him, is said to deviate from Kshatriya duties.</p>
<p id='7'>शक्तः स्यात् सुसुखो राजा कुर्यात् करणमापदि। प्रियो भवति भूतानां न च विभ्रश्यते श्रियः॥<br />The king should show his power, live merrily, and do what is necessary in times of danger. Such a king is loved of all creatures and never falls away from prosperity.</p>
<p id='8'>अप्रियं यस्य कुर्वीत भूयस्तस्य प्रियं चरेत्। नचिरेण प्रियः स स्याद् योऽप्रियः प्रियमाचरेत्॥<br />If you do evil to any person, you should, when the times comes, do him good. One who is not loved becomes an object of love if he does what is good.</p>
<p id='9'>मृषावादं परिहरेत् कुर्यात् प्रियमयाचितः। न कामान च संरम्भान्न द्वेषाद् धर्ममुत्सृजेत्॥<br />Falsehoods should be avoided. You should do good to others without being asked for the same. You should never abandon righteousness from lust or anger or malice.</p>
<p id='10'>नापत्रपेत प्रश्नेषु नाविभाव्यां गिरं सृजेत्। न त्वरेत न चासूयेत् तथा संगृह्यते परः॥<br />Do not reply harshly when questioned by anybody. Do not utter mean words. Never be in a hurry to do anything. Never cherish malice. By such means an enemy is won over.</p>
<p id='11'>प्रिये नातिभृशं हृष्येदप्रिये न च संज्वरेत्। न तप्येदर्थकृच्छ्रेषु प्रजाहितमनुस्मरन्॥<br />Do not be overjoyed when anything pleasant occurs, nor give away to sorrow when anything disagreeable occurs. Never grieve when your wealth is exhausted, and always remember the duty of doing good to your subjects.</p>
<p id='12'>यः प्रियं कुरुते नित्यं गुणतो वसुधाधिपः। तस्य कर्माणि सिद्ध्यन्ति न च संत्यज्यते श्रिया॥<br />That king, who always does what is agreeable by natural inclination, acquires success in all his undertakings and is never shorn of prosperity.</p>
<p id='13'>निवृत्तं प्रतिकूलेषु वर्तमानमनुप्रिये। भक्तं भजेत नृपतिः सदैव सुसमाहितः॥<br />The king should always, carefully, cherish that devoted servant who abstains from doing injury to his master and who always does what is for his good.</p>
<p id='14'>अप्रकीर्णेन्द्रियग्राममत्यन्तानुगतं शुचिम्। शक्तं चैवानुरक्तं च युज्यान्महति कर्मणि॥<br />He should employ in responsible offices persons who have controlled their senses, who are devotedly loyal and of pure conduct, and who are able.</p>
<p id='15'>एवमेतैर्गुणैर्युक्तो योऽनुरज्यति भूमिपम्। भर्तुरर्थेष्वप्रमत्तं नियुज्यादर्थकर्मणि॥<br />That person, who by possessing such qualifications, pleases the king and who never neglects to take care of the interests of his master, should be appointed by the king in the affairs of his kingdom.</p>
<p id='16'>मूढमैन्द्रियकं लुब्धमनार्यचरितं शठम्। अनतीतोपधं हिस्त्रं दुर्बुद्धिमबहुश्रुतम्॥ त्यक्तोदात्तं माद्यरतं यतस्त्रीमृगयापरम्। कार्ये महति युञ्जानो हीयते नृपतिः श्रिया॥<br />On the other hand, the king becomes shorn of prosperity by appointing to important offices men who are fools and slaves of their senses, who are covetous and of disreputable conduct, who are deceitful and hypocritical, who are minded, and addicted to drink, gambling, women, and hunting.</p>
<p id='17'>रक्षितात्मा च यो राजा रक्ष्यान् यश्चानुरक्षति। प्रजाश्च तस्य वर्धन्ते ध्रुवं च महदश्नुते॥<br />That king, who, first protecting his own self, protects others worthy of protection, feels the satisfaction of seeing his subjects prosper. Such a king succeeds also in acquiring greatness.</p>
<p id='18'>ये केचिद् भूमिपतयः सर्वांस्तानन्ववेक्षयेत्। सुहृद्भिरनभिख्यातैस्तेन राजातिरिच्यते॥<br />A king should, by devoted secret agents, watch the conduct and acts of other kings. By such means can he acquire superiority.</p>
<p id='19'>अपकृत्य बलस्थस्य दूरस्थोऽस्मीति नाश्वसेत्। श्येनाभिपतनैरेते निपतन्ति प्रमाद्यतः॥<br />Having injured a powerful king, one should not comfort himself with the idea that the injurer lives at a great distance from the injured. Such kings when injured attack the injurer like the hawk swooping down upon its : prey, in careless moments.</p>
<p id='20'>दृढमूलस्त्वदुष्टात्मा विदित्वा बलमात्मनः। अबलानभियुञ्जीत न तु ये बलवत्तराः॥<br />A king, whose power has been consolidated and who is confident of his own strength, should attack a neighbour who is weaker than himself but never who is stronger.</p>
<p id='21'>विक्रमेण महीं लब्ध्वा प्रजा धर्मेण पालयेत्। आहवे निधनं कुर्याद् राजा धर्मपरायणः॥<br />Having acquired the sovereignty of the Earth by prowess, a virtuous king should protect his subjects fairly and kill enemies in battle</p>
<p id='22'>मरणान्तमिदं सर्वं नेह किञ्चिदनामयम्। तस्माद् धर्मे स्थितो राजा प्रजा धर्मेण पालयेत्॥<br />Everything belonging to this world is liable to destruction. Nothing here is lasting. Therefore, the king, following righteousness, should protect his subjects righteously.</p>
<p id='23'>रक्षाधिकरणं युद्धं तथा धर्मानुशासनम्। मन्त्रचिन्ता सुखं काले पञ्चभिर्वर्धते मही॥<br />The defence of forts, battle, administration of justice, consultations on questions of policy, and keeping the subjects of happiness, these five increase the dominions of a king.</p>
<p id='24'>एतानि यस्य गुप्तानि स राजा राजसत्तमः। सततं वर्तमानोऽत्र राजा धत्ते महीमिमाम्॥<br />That king who takes proper care of these is considered to be the best of kings. By always doing these, a king succeeds in protecting his kingdom.</p>
<p id='25'>नैतान्येकेन शक्यानि सातत्येनानुवीक्षितुम्। तेषु सर्वं प्रतिष्ठाप्य राजा भुक्के चिरं महीम्॥<br />It is impossible, however, for one man to look after all these matters at all times. Transferring such supervision to his ministers, a king may govern the Earth for ever,</p>
<p id='26'>दातारं संविभक्तारं मार्दवोपगतं शुचिम्। असंत्यक्तमनुष्यं च तं जनाः कुर्वते नृपम्॥<br />The people select such a person as their king who is liberal, who shares all objects of enjoyment with others, who is mild by nature, who is of pure conduct, and who will never forsake his subjects.</p>
<p id='27'>यस्तु निःश्रेयसं श्रुत्वा ज्ञानं तत् प्रतिपद्यते। आत्मनो मतमुत्सृज्य तं लोकोऽनुविधीयते॥<br />He is obeyed in the world who, having listened to the advice of the wise, accepts them, leaving aside his own opinions.</p>
<p id='28'>योऽर्थकामस्य वचनं प्रातिकूल्यान मृष्यते। शृणोति प्रतिकूलानि सर्वदा विमना इव॥ अग्राम्यचरितां वृत्तिं यो न सेवेत नित्यदा। जितानामजितानां च क्षत्रधर्मादपैति सः॥<br />That king, who does not accept the advice of a well-wisher for its being opposed to his own views, who listens with inattention to what is said to him in opposition to his views, and who does not always follow the conduct of high and noble persons conquered or unconquered, deviates from the duties of Kshatriyas.</p>
<p id='29'>निगृहीतादमात्याच्च स्त्रीभ्यश्चैव विशेषतः। पर्वताद् विषमाद् दुर्गाद्धस्तिनोऽश्वात् सरीसृपात्। एतेभ्यो नित्ययुक्तः सन् रक्षेदात्मानमेव तु॥ मुख्यानमात्यान् यो हित्वा निहीनान् कुरुते प्रियान्। स वै व्यसनमासाद्य गाधमार्तो न विन्दति॥<br />From ministers, who have once been chastised, from women in particular, from mountains and inaccessible quarrels, from elephants and horses and reptiles, the king should always carefully guard himself. That king, who, leaving his chief ministers, makes favourites of low persons, soon falls into distress and never succeeds in attaining his objects.</p>
<p id='30'>यः कल्याणगुणाज्ञातीन् प्रद्वेषान्नो बुभूषति। अदृढात्मा दृढक्रोधः स मृत्योर्वसतेऽन्तिके॥<br />That weak king, who, under the influence of anger and malice, does not love and honour those amongst his kinsmen, who are endued never with good qualities, is said to live on the very brink of destruction.</p>
<p id='31'>अथ यो गुणसम्पन्नान् हृदयस्याप्रियानपि। प्रियेण कुरुते वश्यांश्चिरं यशसि तिष्ठति॥<br />That king, who wins over accomplished persons by doing good to them even though he may not like them heartily, succedes in enjoying fame for ever.</p>
<p id='32'>नाकाले प्रणयेदर्थान्नाप्रिये जातु संज्वरेत्। प्रिये नातिभृशं तुष्येद् युज्येतारोग्यकर्मणि।॥<br />You should impose taxes unseasonably. You should not be sorry at the occurrence of anything disagreeable, nor rejoice exceedingly at anything agreeable. You should always try to accomplish good acts.</p>
<p id='33'>के वानुरक्ताः राजानः के भयात् समुपाश्रिताः। मध्यस्थदोषाः के चैषामिति नित्यं विचिन्तयेत्॥<br />You should always determine who amongst the dependent kings is truly devoted to you, and who is loyal to you from fear, and who amongst them has faults.</p>
<p id='34'>न जातु बलवान् भूत्वा दुर्बले विश्वसेत् क्वचित्। भारुण्डसदृशा ह्येते निपतन्ति प्रमाद्यतः॥<br />The king, even if he be powerful, should trust the weak, for in moments of carelessness the weak may attack the powerful like a flock of vultures seizing their prey.</p>
<p id='35'>अपि सर्वगुणैर्युक्तं भर्तारं प्रियवादिनम्। अभिद्रुह्यति पापात्मा न तस्माद् विश्वसेज्जनात्॥<br />A sinful man seeks to injure his master even if the latter be sweet-speeched and endued with every accomplishment. Do not, therefore, repose confidence in such men.</p>
<p id='36'>एवं राजोपनिषदं ययातिः स्माह नाहुषः। मनुष्यविषये युक्तो हन्ति शत्रूननुत्तमान्॥<br />Nahusha's son Yayati, in describing the mysteries of king-craft, said that a person in ruling men should kill even contemptible foes.</p>
