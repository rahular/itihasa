<h3>APADDHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 161</h3><h4>Penance is the most important</h4><p id='1'>भीष्म उवाच सर्वमेतत् तपोमूलं कवयः परिचक्षते। न ह्यतप्ततपा मूढः क्रियाफलमवाप्नुते॥<br />Bhishma said They who arc endued with knowledge say that everything springs from penance. That foolish person who has not practised penances does not get the rewards of even his own acts.</p>
<p id='2'>प्रजापतिरिदं सर्वं तपसैवासृजत् प्रभुः। तथैव वेदानृषयस्तपसा प्रतिपेदिरे॥<br />The powerful Creator created all this universe with the help of penances. In ihe same way, the Rishis won ihe Vedas by the power of penanccs.</p>
<p id='3'>तपसैव ससर्जानं फलमूलानि यानि च। त्रील्लोकांस्तपसा सिद्धाः पश्यन्ति सुसमाहिताः॥<br />It was by the help of penances that the Grandfather created food, fruits and roots. It is one by penances that ascetics behold the three worlds, with enraptured souls.</p>
<p id='4'>औषधान्यगदादीनि क्रियाश्च विविधास्तथा। तपसैव हि सिद्ध्यन्ति तपोमूलं हि साधनम्॥<br />Medicines and all antidotes to poisonous articles, and the various acts (seen here), produce their intended results through the help of penance. The fulfilment of all purposes depends upon penance.</p>
<p id='5'>यद् दुरापं भवेत् किंचित् तत्सर्वं तपसो भवेत्। ऐश्वर्यमृषयः प्राप्तास्तपसैव न संशयः॥<br />Whatever things there are which seem to be unattainable are sure to be acquired by penance. forsooth, the Rishis acquired their sixfold divine attributes through penance.</p>
<p id='6'>सुरापोऽसम्मतादायी भ्रूणहा गुरुतल्पगः। तपसैव सुतप्तेन नरः पापात् प्रमुच्यते॥<br />A person who takes intoxicating liquors, who appropriates others' properties without their consent, one guilty of foeticide, one who violates his preceptor's bed, are all purified by penance duly performed.</p>
<p id='7'>तपसो बहुरूपस्य तैस्तैारैः प्रवर्ततः। निवृत्या वर्तमानस्य तपो नानशनात् परम्॥<br />Penances manifold. They throw themselves through various channels. Of all sorts of penance, however, that one may practise after abstaining from pleasure and enjoyment, abstention from food is the greatest and best.</p>
<p id='8'>अहिंसा सत्यवचनं दानमिन्द्रियनिग्रहः। एतेभ्यो हि महाराज तपो नानशनात् परम्॥<br />The penance of abstention from food is superior, O king, even to mercy, truthfulness, gifts, and restraint of senses.</p>
<p id='9'>न दुष्करतरं दानान्नातिमातरमाश्रयः। विद्यभ्यः परं नास्ति संन्यासः परमं तपः॥<br />There is not act more hard to perform than gift. There is no mode of life which is superior to serving one's mother. There is no creature are superior to those who are conversant with the three Vedas. Likewise, Renunciation is the highest penance.</p>
<p id='10'>इन्द्रियाणीह रक्षन्ति स्वर्गधर्माभिगुप्तये। तस्मादर्थे च धर्मे च तपो नानशनात् परम्॥<br />People restrain their senses for taking care of their virtue and heaven. There is no penance higher than abstention from food in control over the senses as also in the acquisition of virtue.</p>
<p id='11'>ऋषयः पितरो देवा मनुष्या मृगपक्षिणः। यानि चान्यानि भूतानि स्थावराणि चराणि च॥ तपः परायणाः सर्वे सिद्ध्यन्ति तपसा च ते। इत्येवं तपसा देवा महत्त्वं प्रतिपेदिरे॥<br />The Rishis, the gods, human beings, beasts, birds, and all other creatures, mobile or immobile, practise penances, and whatever success they acquire is won through penance. It was through penance that the gods acquired their superiority.</p>
<p id='12'>इमानीष्टविभागानि फलानि तपसः सदा। तपसा शक्यते प्राप्तुं देवत्वमपि निश्चयात्॥<br />The luminous bodies in the sky have got their position through penance. Forsooth, through penance the very status of godhead may be gained.</p>
