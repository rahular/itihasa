<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 26</h3><h4>Yudhishthira describes the two paths to heaven. The necessity of Sacrifices and Vedic Study. The proper use of wealth.</h4><p id='1'><a href='#1'></a>वैशम्पायन उवाच अस्मिन्नेव प्रकरणे धनंजयमुदारधीः। अभिनीततरं वाक्यमित्युवाच युधिष्ठिरः॥<br />Vaishampayana said Thereat, the great Yudhishthira said to</p>
<p id='2'><a href='#2'></a>यदेतन्मन्यसे पार्थ न ज्यायोऽस्ति धनादिति। न स्वर्गो न सुखं नार्थो निर्धनस्येति तन्मृषा॥<br />You think, O Partha, that there is nothing superior to wealth, and that the poor man can neither have heaven, nor happiness, nor the accomplishment of his wishes.</p>
<p id='3'><a href='#3'></a>स्वाध्याययज्ञसंसिद्धा दृश्यन्ते बहवो जनाः। तपोरताश्च मुनयो येषां लोकाः सनातनाः॥<br />This however, is not true. Many persons are scen who have become successful through Sacrifice in the shape of Vedic study. Many sages are seen who by practising penances have acquired eternal regions for themselves.</p>
<p id='4'><a href='#4'></a>ऋषीणां समयं शश्वद् ये रक्षन्ति धनंजय। आश्रिताः सर्वधर्मज्ञा देवास्तान् ब्राह्मणान् विदुः॥<br />They, O Dhananjaya who always follow the practice of the Rishis by leading the life of a Brahmacharin and who become acquainted with all duties, are regarded by the gods as Brahmanas.</p>
<p id='5'><a href='#5'></a>स्वाध्यायनिष्ठान् हि ऋषीन् ज्ञाननिष्ठांस्तथापरान्। बुद्ध्येथाः संततं चापि धर्मनिष्ठान् धनंजय॥<br />O Dhananjaya, you should always know those Rishis who are devoted to the study of the Vedas and those who are devoted to the pursuit of true knowledge as persons who are truly virtuous.</p>
<p id='6'><a href='#6'></a>ज्ञाननिष्ठेषु कार्याणि प्रतिष्ठाप्यानि पाण्डव। वैखानसानां वचनं यथा नो विदितं प्रभो॥<br />O son of Pandu, all our acts should be shaped by those who are devoted to the acquisition of true knowledge. Surely it is the opinion of the Vaikhanasas, O powerful one.</p>
<p id='7'><a href='#7'></a>अजाश्च पृश्नयश्चैव सिकताश्चैव भारत। अरुणाः केतवश्चैव स्वाध्यायेन दिवं गताः॥<br />The Ajas, the Prishnis, the Sikatas, O Bharata, Arunas, and the Ketavas, have all gone to heaven by the merit of Vedic study.</p>
<p id='8'><a href='#8'></a>अवाप्यैतानि कर्माणि वेदोक्तानि धनंजय। दानमध्ययनं यज्ञो निग्रहश्चैव दुर्ग्रहः॥ दक्षिणेन च पन्थानमर्यम्णो ये दिवं गताः। एतान् क्रियावतां लोकानुक्तवान् पूर्वमप्यहम्॥<br />By performing those acts, O Dhananjaya, that are laid down in the Vedas, viz., battle, study of the Vedas, Sacrifices, the control of passion that is so difficult, one goes to heaven by the southern path of the Sun. I have, before this, told you that those very regions are reserved for persons who perform (Vedic) acts.</p>
<p id='9'><a href='#9'></a>उत्तरेण तु पन्थानं नियमाद् यं प्रपश्यसि। एते यागवतां लोका भान्ति पार्थ सनातनाः॥<br />You will see, however, that the northern path is trodden by those who are devoted to Yoga. Those eternal and bright regions to which that path leads is reserved for Yogins.</p>
<p id='10'><a href='#10'></a>तत्रोत्तरां गतिं पार्थ प्रशंसन्ति पुराविदः। संतोषो वै स्वर्गतमः संतोषः परमं सुखम्॥<br />Of these two, the northern path is spoken highly by those conversant with the Puranas. You should know that one gains heaven through contentment begets happiness.</p>
<p id='11'><a href='#11'></a>तुष्टेर्न किञ्चित् परमं सा सम्यक् प्रतितिष्ठति। विनीतक्रोधहर्षस्य सततं सिद्धिरुत्तमा॥<br />There is nothing superior to contentment. To the Yogin who has controlled anger and joy, contentment is the greatest success.</p>
<p id='12'><a href='#12'></a>अत्राप्युदाहरन्तीमा गाथा गीता ययातिना। याभिः प्रत्याहरेत् कामान् कूर्मोऽङ्गानीव सर्वशः॥<br />Regarding it is cited the discourse of Yayati. Listening to that discourse one can withdraw all his desires like a tortoise drawing in all his limbs.</p>
<p id='13'><a href='#13'></a>यदा चायं न बिभेति यदा चास्मात बिभ्यति। यदा नेच्छति न देशि ब्रह्म सम्पद्यते तदा॥<br />When one entertains no fear of anything, when one is not feared by anything when one entertains no desire, when one bears no hate, then is one said to have attained to the dignity of Brahma.</p>
<p id='14'><a href='#14'></a>यदा न भावं कुरुते सर्वभूतेषु पापकम्। कर्मणा मनसा वाचा ब्रह्म सम्पद्यते तदा॥<br />When one does not commit sin by any creature, in deed, thought, or word, one is then said to have attained to Brahma.</p>
<p id='15'><a href='#15'></a>विनीतमानमोहश्च बहुसङ्गविवर्जितः। तदाऽऽत्मज्योतिषः साधोर्निर्वाणमुपपद्यते॥<br />When one has governed his pride and folly, and withdrawn himself from all attachments, it is then that pious man of controlled soul becomes fit for attaining to that emancipation which is brought about by the annihilation of personal existence.</p>
<p id='16'><a href='#16'></a>इदं तु शृणु मे पार्थ ब्रुवतः संयतेन्द्रियः। धर्ममन्ये वृत्तमन्ये धनमीहन्ति चापरे॥<br />Listen now to me with rapt attention, O son of Pritha, as I say it to you. Some seek virtue; some, good conduct, and some, wealth.</p>
<p id='17'><a href='#17'></a>धनहेतोर्य ईहेत तस्यानीहा गरीयसी। भूयान् दोषो हि वित्तस्य यश्च धर्मस्तदाश्रयः॥<br />One may desire wealth. The abandonment, however, of such desire is better for himn. There are many shortcomings attached to wealth and, therefore, to those religious acts that are performed with wealth.</p>
<p id='18'><a href='#18'></a>प्रत्यक्षमनुपश्यामि त्वमपि द्रष्टुमर्हसि। वर्जनं वर्जनीयानामीहमानेन दुष्करम्॥<br />We have seen it with our own eyes. You should also see this. He that desires wealth finds it very difficult to leave off that which should by all means be abandoned.</p>
<p id='19'><a href='#19'></a>ये वित्तमभिपद्यन्ते सम्यक्त्वं तेषु दुर्लभम्। दुह्यतः प्रैति तत् प्राहुः प्रतिकूलं यथातथम्॥<br />Good deeds are very rare in those who collect riches. It is said that wealth can never be acquired without injuring others, and that, when acquired, it is attended with various troubles.</p>
<p id='20'><a href='#20'></a>यस्तु सम्भिन्नवृत्तः स्याद् वीतशोकभयो नरः। अल्पेन तृषितो दुह्यन् भ्रूणहत्यां न बुध्यते॥<br />A weak minded person, disregarding the fear of repentance, oppresses others, tempted by even a little wealth, not knowing all while of the sin Brahmanicide that he incurs by his acts.</p>
<p id='21'><a href='#21'></a>दुष्यन्त्याददतो भृत्या नित्यं दस्युभयादिव। दुर्लभं च धनं प्राप्य भृशं दत्त्वानुतप्यते॥<br />Acquiring wealth which is so difficult of acquisition, one burns with grief if he has to give a part of it, even if it be, to his servants,-tantamount to what he would actually feel if he is robbed by others. If, on the other hand, one does not distribute his wealth, he becomes an object of censure.</p>
<p id='22'><a href='#22'></a>अधनः कस्य किं वाच्यो विमुक्तः सर्वशः सुखी। देवस्वमुपगृव धनेन न सुखी भवेत्॥<br />One, however, that has no wealth, is never blamed. Forsaking all attachments, such a person can become happy in all respects by living upon what little he may get as alms. No one, however, can be happy by acquiring riches.</p>
<p id='23'><a href='#23'></a>अत्र गाथां यज्ञगीतां कीर्तयन्ति पुराविदः। त्रयीमुपाश्रितां लोके यज्ञ संस्तरकारिकाम्॥<br />Regarding it certain verses relating to Sacrifices are recited by persons well read in ancient scriptures.</p>
<p id='24'><a href='#24'></a>यज्ञाय सृष्टानि धनानि धात्रा यज्ञाय सृष्टः पुरुषो रक्षिता च। तस्मात् सर्वं यज्ञ एवोपयोज्यं धनं न कामाय हितं प्रशस्तम्॥<br />Wealth was created by the Creator for celebrating Sacrifices, and man was created by hinn for protecting that wealth and performing Sacrifices. For this, all wealth should be devoted to Sacrifices. It is not proper that it should be spent for enjoyments.</p>
<p id='25'><a href='#25'></a>एतत् स्वार्थे च कौन्तेय धनं धनवतां वर। धाता ददाति मर्येभ्यो यज्ञार्थमिति विद्धि तत्॥<br />The Creator gives wealth to mortals for the sake of Sacrifices. Know this, O Son of Kunti, foremost of all wealthy persons.</p>
<p id='26'><a href='#26'></a>तस्माद् बुद्ध्यन्ति पुरुषा न हि तत् कस्यचिद्धवम्। श्रद्धानस्ततो लोको दद्याच्चैव यजेत च॥<br />Therefore the wise think that wealth, forsooth, is nobody's on Earth. One should celebrate Sacrifices with it and give it away with a confident heart.</p>
<p id='27'><a href='#27'></a>लब्धस्य त्यागमित्याहुन भोगं न च संचयम्। तस्य किं संचयेनार्थः कार्ये ज्यायसि तिष्ठति॥<br />One should make gift of what he has acquired, and not waste or spend it in gratifying his desire of enjoyment. What use is there in hoarding up wealth when proper objects exist in which to spend it.</p>
<p id='28'><a href='#28'></a>ये स्वधर्मादपेतेभ्यः प्रयच्छन्त्यल्पबुद्धयः। शतं वर्षाणि ते प्रेत्य पुरीषं भुञ्जते जनाः॥<br />Those foolish people who give away (wealth) to men who have neglected the duties of their order, have to live hereafter for a hundred years on ordure and dirt.</p>
<p id='29'><a href='#29'></a>अनर्हते यद् ददाति न ददाति यदर्हते। अनिर्हापरिज्ञानाद् दानधर्मोऽपि दुष्करः॥<br />Being unable to the discriminate between the deserving and the undeserving, men give to the undeserving and refrain from giving to the deserving. For this reason the administration of charity is difficult.</p>
<p id='30'><a href='#30'></a>लब्धानामपि वित्तानां बोद्धव्यौ द्वावतिक्रमौ। अपात्रे प्रतिपत्तिश्च पात्रे चाप्रतिपादनम्॥<br />These are the two faults with wealth even when acquired, viz., gift to an undeserving person and abstaining to give to a deserving man.</p>
