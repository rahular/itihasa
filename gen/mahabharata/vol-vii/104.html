<h3>RAJADHARMANUSHASANA PARVA: Chapter 1O4</h3><h4>The duties of a king who is opposed by his own officers</h4><p id='1'>युधिष्ठिर उवाच धार्मिकोऽर्थानसम्प्राप्य राजामात्यैः प्रबाधितः। च्युतः कोशाच्च दण्डाच्च सुखमिच्छन् कथं चरेत्॥<br />How should a righteous king, who is proposed by his own officers whose treasury and army are not under his control, and who has no wealth, act for acquiring happiness?"</p>
<p id='2'>भीष्म उवाच अत्रायं क्षेमदर्शीय इतिहासोऽनुगीयते। तत् तेऽहं सम्प्रवक्ष्यामि तन्निबोध युधिष्ठिर।॥<br />Bhishma said “Regarding it the story of Kshemadarshin is often related. I shall describe that story to you. Listen to it, O Yudhishthira.</p>
<p id='3'>क्षेमदर्शी नृपसुतो यत्र क्षीणबलः पुरा। मुनि कालकवृक्षीयमाजगामेति नः श्रुतम्। तं पप्रच्छानुसंगृह्य कृच्छ्रामापदमास्थितः॥<br />We have heard that in days of yore, when prince Kshemadarshin had become weak in strength and fallen into great distress, he went to the sage Kalakavrikshiva and saluting him humbly, said him these words,</p>
<p id='4'>राजोवाच अर्थेषु भागी पुरुष ईहमानः पुनः पुनः। अलब्ध्वा मद्विधो राज्यं ब्रह्मन् किं कर्तुमर्हति॥ अन्यत्र मरणाद् दैन्यादन्यत्र परसंश्रयात्। क्षुद्रादन्यत्र चाचारात् तन्ममाचक्ष्व सत्तम॥<br />What should a person like me who is worthy to have wealth, but who has, after repeated attempts, failed to regain his kingdom, do, O Brahmana, excepting suicide, thieving and robbery, secking refuge with others, and other acts of meanness of a similar nature? O best of men, tell me this.</p>
<p id='5'>व्याधिना चाभिपन्नस्य मानसेनेतरेण वा। धर्मज्ञश्च कृतज्ञश्च त्वद्विधः शरणं भवेत्॥<br />One like you who are conversant with morality and full of gratefulness is the refuge of a person suffering from disease mental or physical.</p>
<p id='6'>निर्विद्यति नरः कामानिर्विद्य सुखमेधते। त्यक्त्वा प्रीतिं च शोकं च लब्ध्वा बुद्धिमयं वसु॥<br />Man should renounce his desires. By acting in that way, by casting off joy and sorrow, and acquiring the wealth of knowledge, he succeeds in acquiring happiness.</p>
<p id='7'>सुखपाश्रयं येषामनुशोचामि तानहम्। मम ह्यर्थाः सुबहवो नष्टाः स्वप्न इवागताः॥<br />I am sorry for them who follow worldly happiness accruing from wealth. All that, however, disappears like a dream.</p>
<p id='8'>दुष्करं बत कुर्वन्ति महतोऽस्त्यिजन्ति ये। वयं त्वेतान् परित्यक्तुमसतोऽपि न शक्नुमः॥<br />They who can renounce vast wealth achieve a most difficult task. As for ourselves we are unable to renounce that wealth which exists no longer.</p>
<p id='9'>इमामवस्थां सम्प्राप्तं दीनमार्तं श्रिया च्युतम्। यदन्यत् सुखमस्तीह तद् ब्रह्मन्ननुशाधि माम्॥<br />I am shorn of prosperity and have been reduced to a miserable and unhappy plight! Instruct me, O Brahmana, what happiness I may yet try to secure.</p>
<p id='10'>कौसल्येनैवमुक्तस्तु राजपुत्रेण धीमता। मुनिः कालकवृक्षीयः प्रत्युवाच महाद्युतिः॥<br />Thus accosted by the intelligent prince of Koshala, the sage Kalakavrikshiya gave the following answer,</p>
<p id='11'>मुनिरुवाच पुरस्तादेव ते बुद्धिरियं कार्या विजानता। अनित्यं सर्वमेवैतदहं च मम चास्ति यत्॥<br />The sage said-You have, it appears, already understood it. Endued with knowledge as you are, you should act as you think. Your belief is correct, namely,-All this that I see is brittle, myself as also everything that I have!</p>
<p id='12'>यत् किंचिन्मन्यसेऽस्तीति सर्वं नास्तीति विद्धि तत्। एवं न व्यथते प्राज्ञः कृच्छ्रामप्यापदं गतः॥<br />Know, O prince, that those things which you consider as existing do not in reality exist. The wise know this very well, and are, therefore, never pained with the distress whatever that may be.</p>
<p id='13'>यद्धि भूतं भविष्यं च सर्वं तन्न भविष्यति। एवं विदितवेद्यस्त्वमधर्मेभ्यः प्रमोक्ष्यसे॥<br />What has taken place and what will bring to pass are all unreal, When you will know this which should be known by all, you will be shorn of unrighteousness.</p>
<p id='14'>यच्च पूर्वं समाहारे यच्च पूर्वं परे परे। सर्वं तन्नास्ति ते चैव तज्ज्ञात्वा कोऽनुसंज्वरेत्॥<br />Whatever things had been acquired by those that came before, and whatever acquired by their successors, have all perished. Thinking of all this, who is there that will give way to grief?</p>
<p id='15'>भूत्वा च न भवत्येतदभूत्वा च भविष्यति। शोके न ह्यस्ति सामर्थ्यं शोकं कुर्यात् कथंचन॥<br />Things that were, are no more. Things that are, will again be no more. Grief cannot restore them. One should not, therefore, succumb to grief.</p>
<p id='16'>क्व नु तेऽद्य पिता राजन् क्व नु तेऽद्य पितामहः। न त्वं पश्यसि तानद्य न त्वां पश्यन्ति तेऽपि च॥<br />Where, O king, is your father to-day and where your grandfather? To-day you see them not, nor do they now see you!</p>
<p id='17'>आत्मनोऽध्रुवतां पश्यंस्तांस्त्वं किमनुशोचसि। बुद्ध्या चैवानुबुद्ध्यस्व ध्रुवं हि न भविष्यसि॥<br />Meditating on your own instability, why do you grieve for them? Think with the help of your intelligence, and you will understand that you will cease to be!</p>
<p id='18'>अहं च त्वं च नृपते सुहृदः शत्रवश्च ते। अवश्यं न भविष्यामः सर्वं च न भविष्यति॥<br />Myself, yourself, O king, your friends, and your foes, shall forsooth, cease to be. Indeed, everything will cease to be.</p>
<p id='19'>ये तु विंशतिवर्षा वै त्रिंशद्वर्षाश्च मानवाः। अर्वागेव हि ते सर्वे मरिष्यन्ति शरच्छतात्॥<br />Those men who are now twenty or thirty years old, will, forsooth, all die within the next hundred years.</p>
<p id='20'>अपि चेन्महतो वित्तान्न प्रमुच्येत पूरुषः। नैतन्ममेति तन्मत्वा कुर्वीत प्रियमात्मनः॥<br />If a man cannot willingly relinquish his immense wealth, he should then try to think that his belongings, are not his own and by that means seek to do good to himself.</p>
<p id='21'>अनागतं यन्न ममेति विद्यादतिक्रान्तं यन्न ममेति विद्यात्। दिष्टं बलीय इति मन्यमार्ना स्ते पण्डितास्तत्सतां स्थानमाहुः॥<br />Future acquisitions should be considered by one as not one's own. Lost properties, should also be regarded by one as not his own. Destiny should be deemed as all powerful. They who think in this wise are considered wise. This mood of regarding all things is an attribute of the good.</p>
<p id='22'>अनाढ्याश्चापि जीवन्ति राज्यं चाप्यनुशासति। बुद्धिपौरुषसम्पन्नास्त्वया तुल्याधिका जनाः॥<br />Many persons who are equal of superior to you in intelligence and inanliness, though bereft of wealth, are not kings but are still alive.</p>
<p id='23'>न च त्वमिव शोचन्ति तस्मात् त्वमपि मा शुचः। किं न त्वं तैनरैः श्रेयांस्तुल्यो वा बुद्धिपौरुषैः॥<br />They are not, like you. They do not indulge in grief like you. Therefore, ceases to grieve in this wise! Are you not superior to those men, or at least equal to them in intelligence and inanliness?</p>
<p id='24'>राजोवाच यादृच्छिकं सर्वमासीत् तद् राज्यमिति चिन्तये। ह्रियते सर्वमेवेदं कालेन महता द्विज॥<br />The king said I consider the kingdom which I had with all its parapharnalia to have been acquired by me without any exertion. Omnipotent Time, however, twice-born one, has swept it away.</p>
<p id='25'>तस्यैव ह्रियमाणस्य स्त्रोतसेव तपोधन। फलमेतत् प्रपश्यामि यथालब्धेन वर्तयन्॥<br />The result, however, that I see, of my kingdom having been carried away by Time as by a stream, is that I am obliged to subsist upon whatever I get as alms.</p>

Be you of such a mood of mind, o prince of Koshala, regarding every affair that may arrest your attention!</p>
<p id='27'>अवाप्यान् कामयन्नर्थान् नानवाप्यान् कदाचन प्रत्युत्पन्नाननुभवनं मा शुचस्त्वमनागतान्॥<br />Wishing to possess only that which is obtainable and not what is unobtainable, do you enjoy your present belongings and never grieve for what is absent.</p>

<p id='30'>अनर्हानपि चैवान्यान्मन्यते श्रीमतो जनान्। एतस्मात् कारणादेतद् दुःखं भूयोऽनुवर्तते॥ ईर्ष्याभिमानसम्पत्रा राजन् पुरुषमानिनः। कच्चित् त्वं न तथा राजन् मत्सरी कोसलाधिप।॥<br />Such a person consider others however undeserving, as men blessed with prosperity. Therefore, those who are possessed of malice and vanity and puffed up with a sense of egoism, suffer more misery still. You however, O king, are not sullied by such vices.</p>
